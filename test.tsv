Ah man. I was really rooting for him making at least the effort to come up with some impressive BS story. Ok, maybe not an alien abduction, but at least a death in the family followed a long period of depression and isolation. You would of course ask him why he didn't come to you in this time of need, and he'd play the introverted sensitive type that was just overwhelmed by life and just couldn't deal, until last week, when thoughts of you started to intrude into the living nightmare that was his waking mind, and slowly started to shine a bright light into his life again. \n It'd have been a 50% kind of deal, but still better than this crap.

It's been almost three months since we (me 27m her 25f) broke up and it's not getting any easier. If anything, it's getting harder. \n long story short, she didn't want to be in a relationship with me but still loves me (i think?). She felt she couldn't offer me what I deserved and our life plans are too misaligned. I disagree, but that's a whole other story. \n So Reddit, how do you deal with losing someone you were intending on marrying? Because i'm having a very difficult time just forgetting the last 2.5 years. There is no way i'm capable of entering another physical let alone emotional relationship. The situation makes me physically sick (like, actually vomiting) and the thought of ever finding someone else makes me feel filthy and disgusting.	heart broken, cant move on because i was so emotionally invested	131	11	relationship_advice
Hey, I met this guy during my first semester at Uni two months ago, and we started dating about three weeks after meeting. I turned him down once after one week because I didn't feel like I would be ready to have a healthy and happy relationship having to balance school and personal family issues. The two of us have a lot in common, and we see eye to eye on all of the major issues, politically, religiously, and etc.. \n However, I never felt like I fell in love with him.. I've had quite a few crushes in the past, and each time I've fallen head over heals for these guys. These guys unfortunately left me absolutely heartbroken and feeling betrayed. I want to feel the butterflies.. the excitement.. and the eagerness to be with my boyfriend. I hate the fact that I'm not feeling in love with him. I didn't like my first kiss.. I didn't like the first time holding hands.. and I was nervous about sleeping over. We've spent days and weeks on end together, but I don't feel in love.. \n I'm desperate to fall in love with him as he has with me.. please, I need some help :( \n edit;	I don't feel that special spark with my boyfriend, but I want to.. help! :C	204	15	relationship_advice
Basically it's my first relationship ever. Lost my virginity to her and all that. She's had a fair number of relationships. Been together for about 4 months. I like her, we get along great. She fell in love with me. \n I am a stoic and sometimes annoyingly logical person so this kind of bothers me since I have no idea what it means or how to react. I can't say that I feel the same because it's all new for me, and the subjectivity involved with such concepts scares me. \n She sees a future with me and hints all the time about things in the far far future that make me question what I am looking for. \n Really I have no complaints with the relationship, it's great. I'm just intimidated by maybe somehow being depended on for someone else's happiness. \n I'm know I should to talk to her about it, I'm aware communication is key, but I wanted to see if other people can share similar experiences.	4 month girlfriend loves me big time, it's my first relationship and I'm intimidated.	167	14	relationship_advice
"I'm Asian and I've lived here in Asia all my life. As such, my upbringing's overarching theme is ""education is everything."" Both my parents grew up dirt poor like most people in my country, but they fought their way to get professional degrees and they bust themselves out of poverty. Like both my parents, I, too, went and got a law degree. In the past, I'd also exclusively dated men with post grad degrees. \n Then, A came. I was signed up on a dating site and A, who lives all the way in the US, won me over. He's the most amazing guy and I am attracted to him on all levels (we already met up, and I've seen all the levels), except for his being an associate's degree holder from some university. He's a vet tech. \n He does have a stable job. Same job for 10 yrs. He's a scientist earning USD 3000 a month. I have no idea if that is a modest or better-than-average salary for Americans. Will appreciate some clarity on this matter too. \n We're both crazy about each other and he wants to get married. I just have these ingrained notions about a 2-year degree being scoffed at, and I know it's stupid, but I'm even embarrassed to tell my parents about A's educational attainment. \n Should I say no to a guy who's otherwise perfect, if it weren't for my culturally-rooted bias against his associate's degree?"	refer to title	241	3	relationship_advice

Hey all, \n We've been dating since January. When we first met, I was more aloof and she was chasing me with texts/calls/planning etc. Always making effort and really willing to do sweet things. She also hinted she wanted a relationship. I was reserved and kept my distance while she worked to get me to open up to her. From her actions, I decided she was right for me, so I did a really cute relationship ask out for Valentine's day, and then she told me she wasn't ready because she's moving away to grad school in August and is afraid to commit, but we are exclusive. Just not in 'a relationship'. I don't get the difference but I guess she sees it. So she asked for a relationship, but when I gave her the option, she changed her mind. Great right? Right now we are basically in a relationship in every way except for the title and the fact that she is afraid to open up a lot of the times. After that incident, she told me she loves me and got me to open up more. Then she withdrew a little. What she does is makes effort and gets me to take a step forward, then pulls back. Now she makes less effort and I'm the one doing most of the work for the relationship. How do I gradually return it to before or at least a balance without having to do something too extreme or hurtful? I really love her and don't want to play games. I just don't want to be taken for granted. Thanks guys.	21 M seeking to reestablish higher interest and effort in 25 F	269	12	relationship_advice
We had been dating for 2 years, and I was a blind fool for the most part of it. i bent over back wards for her and she's cheated on me 5 times that I know of. She is a sweet girl and generally was nice with me but she had a lot of emotional baggage and not the best judgement. \n Anyway, I just caught her again, deep in other man's territory, fornicating, being deceptive with me, and being emotional as usual. I said enough was enough and left her. it's been 2 days since I left her and took all of my belongings back, and had just begun to lick my wounds when she called me telling me a sob story about how she's sorry, that she made a mistake again and that she's dumb and doesn't think. I'm not going to bite at that, and I'm already happy to be rid of our relationship but she wants some sort of guarantee we can get back together a long time down the road, or even be friends. \n I'm a firm believer that everyone can change, learn, and be different. it's too early to give her any hope I feel, but should I let her be friendly with me? She may have hurt me, used me, lied to me, but we had a lot of good times too, and I could stand being her friend in time because id rather not have any more ill feelings, but idk. Like I said she's nice, but she's so horridly confused in the head... so in months time should I throw her a bone and let her try and be friends with me again, or should I just try and remove her from my life for a long time? I'll never be able to trust her again though, not for a long, long time..	Girl leads me off and on majority of relationship, I leave her, she regrets everything and wants to make amends and says she's a fool for losing me. Should I toss her a bone in the future and maybe re-allow friendship, or if she's drastically changed and better, re-allow dating from square one again?	311	54	relationship_advice
I have an ex that I have a long history with. We met when we were 16, and I was completely enamored with her from the start; she felt the same about me. The thing is, we were both awkward kids and didn't know how to express it. We fell out of touch for about 10 years, and then reconnected. We began dating, and it was the most passionate and loving relationship I have ever known. \n We separated almost two years ago after 1 year of dating, but we've had these moments where we come back into each other's lives for a month or two, basically act like we're dating, then get into some argument and stop completely. It's not messy though when it happens. She also lives about an hour and a half away from me, which also contributed to our problems. \n The thing is, she has a dead-end job that she hates and no ambition AT ALL. It irks me, and she procrastinates like no one's business, so I can become resentful about that. it also seemed like she would get angry at me for no reason weekly, and then completely shut down when I tried to talk it out. It would drive me crazy, and it would completely ruin a night if we went out together. \n After dating around for a year or two, she's always in my mind still. I wonder if I'm making a huge mistake. I think she is funny, and the most beautiful woman I have ever met.  I wonder if the distance is a big part of the problem and that maybe things would change if we lived together. I also wonder if couples therapy would be something to consider. We both see therapists separately, and coming from our backgrounds, we've never really seen a healthy relationship in our households. But is therapy a good idea and something we should consider at 30 and just starting out? I think our communication might be off. I wonder if what I'm searching for is just the perfect woman -- which doesn't exist -- and I fear that I'm overlooking her in a quest for some mythical person while focussing on this girl's flaws too much. I'm terrified that I'll regret this, because I still love her very, very much. Are our problems just normal relationship-type issues? Am I judging them too much? As a kid growing up I watched my mom go through 3 divorces, so I might just be too overly critical? I have no idea. We both come from broken homes. Thanks. \n <b>	"b> Had some issues with my ex who I still love, but wondering if I'm being stupid and searching for ""the perfect woman"" -- which doesn't exist, when really my ex is the one."	431	34	relationship_advice
I became friends with this guy about 4 months ago and we have been hanging out together very often since then. He confessed recently that he thought of me as more than a friend and that he would like for us to be in a relationship, but only if I was ready for it. He said that the decision was completely up to me and promised that we would still be good friends no matter what. \n I am feeling very torn because I love almost every aspect of him - he's the kindest, sweetest person I know, he cares so much, always puts my interests before his, and he's never pushed me to do anything I'm not ready to do. He is the only person around whom I can completely be myself, and we never ever run out of things to talk about. This is why I feel absolutely horrible that I'm not physically attracted to him and that this is making me hesitant. \n I truly enjoy his company and care very much for him, but I feel that it wouldn't be fair to him at all if we were to start a relationship without me feeling any physical attraction towards him. What do you guys think? Could I learn to love him for who he is, or should I spare him the hurt and the pain right now and say no?	My best friend wants us to be in a relationship.

So I've been dating this girl for a while now and she constantly asks about my sexual past with my previous gf's. She already knew that I have had sex before with them but for some reason wanted to know more info i.e. location/positions. Since I really liked her I told her everything except for one location. I left it out for 2 reasons, 1. I almost don't even count it and sort of forgot about it, and 2. She is less experienced than me and I didnt want to hurt her feelings. \n Fast forward, she and I did it in that location that I left out and made a comment that it was a great first time experience for us and I just couldn't tell her that I did it before and agreed with her. Granted it was a great time but her comment just resonated very weirdly with me. \n Now I am torn bc Idk if I should tell her about it or not. I've been feeling like shit about it and it's causing me to be very stressed. I want to tell her but she has blown up and almost broke up with me in the past for lying/neglecting to tell her everything when she asked me what I have done before. I've assured her then that It wouldn't happen again and now I fear that this would be it happening again and I feel like she would break up with me. I don't want to lose her bc I love her very much but I feel like she should know. \n I realize that she shouldn't even have really asked about my past in the first place but also I shouldn't have lied to her. \n Any sort of advice on the matter or something that will help ease my stress would be greatly appreciated. I feel like shit.	Torn bt telling my gf about my sexual past that I left out when she asked me or not.

"This is an incredibly complex situation, or maybe I'm making it more complex. Bear with me: \n I met my wife about 6 years ago through a mutual friend, our careers jived pretty well (cop/nurse). She has a daughter (10) and we have three toddlers together. We've been married about 3.5 years. \n Things were going well until spring of 2012. Through a series of catastrophic/dramatic personal events - two of my friends died, my grandfather and my mother died, i found out i was infertile, went through IVF, we had babies - i had a nervous breakdown. I drank a lot, i took pills, i kissed another girl in a drunken stupor, and through an incident at work i ended up resigning, then criminal charges and jail time. Quite the fall from grace. Our lives turned upside down very, very quickly. \n After my arrest, she was cold and scathing. She began engaging in really inappropriate texting (likely even sexting). While i was out on bail, we worked on the relationship where we could, and it (by her admission) seemed to get better. While I was in jail, she had an affair with a coworker from years ago. She admitted to sexting another guy, too. \n I've since been released, totally clean and sober, living mostly separate. On one of my ""I need something so I'll call you over"" visits,  I caught her sexting her ex boy-toy. Very suggestive. Since then, she's ignored mostly all of my calls and texts. If I didn't have a nanny, I wouldn't know the status of my kids. \n Now, I was no angel. I'll be the first to admit that. I treated her poorly in those 5 months, drinking a lot and not spending time with her. I never raised a hand to her or was ever verbally abusive, I was just too preoccupied with lawn work and drinking to pay attention to her and my newborns. \nSince my arrest and recovery, she has been, I dare say, verbally abusive. I've heard, on a practically daily basis, how much of a screw up and a drunk i was, how i ""ruined this family"", and get the implication that ""after everything (I) did to this family"", that she can run around on me with other guys. \n What do I do? We've got three toddlers and an in-between. I can't just up and leave... can I? I can't emotionally stand to lose her on top of everything else I've lost. \n I'm very sorry if i've jumped around, I'm likely missing a lot of details. I'll fill in as questions arise."

"My girlfriend of 9 months has always had this ""best guy friend"" ive been kinda suspicious about. I'm not a snooper or anything, but I have done a little detective work, and I'm kind of worried.

"A few times in our relationship, my girlfriend will do something that I do not approve and even gets me angry, but I don't know if I should scold her, brush it off, or whatever, to keep an otherwise very healthy and great relationship. \n A specific example: We are moving together to a new apartment and we are trying to save money for the furniture, savings, etc. Specially her, since she has some small debts (can pay them off in 1-2 months), earns less money than me and doesn't have good savings habits. Just 2 weeks ago I sat with her, went through all her finances and gave some advice on handling money. She is very smart so I thought she got the hang of it. \nAnd she did, until today, where she 'confessed' me that driving home, she saw a nice dress from a store, went in it, and straight bought two $40USD dresses. ""I couldn't resist! They were lovely, and you will love how they look on me!"" she happily texted to me. She genuinely didn't think she did anything wrong. I instantly got angry and told her (calmly) that it wasn't a good idea at all due to our circumstances. She defended saying that I shouldn't worry because she has the budget that we arranged for her under control. But I kept telling her why it was a very bad idea, that she did wrong because she could have used the money for something better, that she didn't need them at all, etc. until I got her to feel bad with herself. \nShe finally apologized and said that she will return them. I only said that all this was for her and our well-being.

So after some time lurking on reddit, I think it\u2019s time to come out and post. \n I am 28 (m) my gf is 24, we have been together for 6 years and I decided to break up with her for many reasons. Mainly because were are headed in different directions; I own a business and I am ready to start a family, whereas she is just starting law school and will not have time for that. Other smaller issues that built up were her lack of gratitude for things I would do for her, she would not trust me because of my past (being a guy that enjoyed the company of women), plus the arguments got worse and worse. I decided to put a stop to it before we would end up hating each other.

I met this chill ass girl ( that we'll call Girl A) in the school library and we exchanged numbers and stayed in touch ever since. Its been like 4-5 months of constant hanging out, and she knows that for the most part I was feelin her hella hard. But lately I've gotten over her cause I thought her long distance relationship wouldn't last that long and I could just step in and fill the gap. Cause to be honest she said she was feelin me too. But she's still going out with this man from back home , and I don't like pulling a Jim from the office and waiting for her till she breaks up, so I just stepped aside. I kind of got tired of being nice to her also, cause in her mind she saw my niceness in the wrong light, thinkin I'm weak. Long story short about Girl A- I fucking thought this was the greatest woman on the planet, but after time her attitude made me not only get over her, but have a small resentment towards her. We still hang out and shit, and everything is cool as friends. \n But the interesting part is that this girl has a female friend that is feeling me hella hard, and she expreses her feelings in front of girl A, which I think is the funniest thing ever. I try and look at girl A while her friend makes pleasant comments about me. lol Anyway, from her facial expressions I could tell she doesn't like it and she tries to ignore them even though she is paying full attention. Now this is where I'm asking you for your input, I'm not the type of fucked up person to swoop in and fuck up a friendship between two girls, and I definitely don't want to be cause. I still have respect for girl A, but her friend is just so fine and so physically attracted to me that I can't really stop it. She wants to cook for me and invites me to her house all the time, but out of respect for girl A I reject the offers for the most part. \n What you say reddit? should I just not give a fuck and hit up girl B and start something with her? \n But I can't lie, I love seeing the jealousy and pissed off emotion in girl A's eyes everytime girl be makes a comment about me. lol	I liked girl A, hung out with her everyday but shit didn't work out.\nGirl B comes along and is girl A's best friend, and she is feeling me hella hard. \nIf I do what girl B intends there will be some repercussions which you could imagine.

I have been in a long distance relationship with my GF for only a couple months (became official in January; known each other for about a year). We get along well and we see each other whenever we can. The problem is arising in our differences in the bedroom. She is a somewhat practicing Roman Catholic (with fairly liberal views) and is a virgin (26F). I have had what I consider an average number of partners over the years.\nI don't mind waiting for her to be ready, but I see a catch-22 developing in our relationship. I think that she is waiting to have sex for the first time with the man she expects to marry (she has mentioned that she isn't waiting for marriage). I, on the other hand, would never make that kind of lasting commitment to someone with whom I had not had a long, sexually active relationship. My fear stems from a past 2-year relationship that gradually slumped into never having sex. The woman in that past relationship never wanted to have sex, and when it did happen, I got the distinct feeling (from her lack of enthusiasm) that it was just to placate me. Needless to say, this is a horrible feeling, and I eventually ended the relationship.\nI fear a similar situation developing in this relationship. I just found out a couple weekends ago that she doesn't masturbate and has never had an orgasm. I worry that since sex has never been a part of her life and she has been completely happy not participating in that aspect of relationships, that things won't change after we have sex.\nI also don't want to be her first, if I decide that I don't think a long-term relationship will work out.\nI think that her reluctance has its roots in her Catholic upbringing, so any perspective on that aspect would be greatly appreciated as well.\nI haven't brought up the depth of my concerns with her directly yet because I don't want the conversation to spiral without adequate preparation (i.e. knowing what I want to say). I have told her about my issues with that past, sexless relationship, but she doesn't know how she will respond after having sex for the first time (honest and understandable).\nI feel that my own upbringing and the media have shaped my outlook to make breaking up with a girl (primarily) because she doesn't want to have sex a shallow, all-around-jerk, move. But is it really so unreasonable to want a partner who values a healthy sexual relationship as much as I do? She's a very nice person and fits very well into my life in a variety of ways that I won't get into here. Also I've met her whole family and made some friendships; a break-up would be painful at this point, but of course worse later.\nAny constructive advice is greatly appreciated.	Long distance 26F GF is a virgin. Never masturbated or had any sexual contact in previous relationships. I fear further commitment may lead to a sexless relationship.

This, for obvious reasons is a throw away account. Reddit, I have encountered a bit of a problem that I am having trouble dealing with. I am attracted to my wife\u2019s  younger sister sexually. In no way would I ever act on anything,   I could never hurt my wife like that, hell, I already feel like I am betraying her. I just can\u2019t get my sister in law off my mind.  My sister in-law has in no way ever made any advances that hint at anything sexual, I am pretty sure she is repulsed by me. What I feel for her is purely sexual as she is a tyrant and a bit of a bitch. She has a fantastic body on her, and great smile, I can barely keep my eyes off her. The big problem is she lives with us, and will be for the next little while. Sometime I just don\u2019t know what I am going to do. When she gets in her Sleep wear at night, and comes to the living room to watch tv, its usually in something casual like  a pair of boxers or pajama pants, and a tight form sitting spaghetti strap top, usually bra-less and she is\u2026 uh, well endowed in the chest area.  It takes all my will power as a man not to look, I can barely look her in the eyes when she talk to me.  I feel nothing toward her romantically, its purely sexual, almost animalistic.

I (28/f) and my SO (29/m) have the absolute best sex I've ever had, and even after a year, it's just as amazing. However, his libido has dropped down to non-existent, whereas mine is just about as high as it has been our entire relationship. So here I am, looking for some outside perspective on how I may be able to handle this situation. \n A little inside story: \n There are many stresses going on in both of our lives at the moment, including recovery. This, I know, is one of the main reasons for the lack of interest, along with some rather rough patches we've been through recently. \n His rejections play into the insecurities I already have and make me feel undesirable. Not to mention, the tension that has been building for the last 2 months has aroused questions within myself as to whether or not this is something that I would be willing to continue waiting on. \n Just to clarify, I am completely in love with him. The connection I have with him is unlike anything I've ever experienced and do not want to let it go. But I fear that his libido may never come back and that this will only cause the horrible possibility of the end for us. \n So my question is this: what would be a good way to approach the matter with him?	The title. Good ways to approach the matter without making him feel pushed. \n Edit: Just wanted to say thank you to those who have replied. If nothing else, it's helped remind me to put more effort in maintaining my patience. I still plan on figuring out a way to communicate through this situation. When this happens, I'll give you guys an update, if you like.	229	65	relationship_advice

My boyfriend and I met five years ago while working for the same company. After about a year of becoming really good friends, we dated for about 6 months, before he moved about 4 hours away. He was also going to be spending the majority of the next year travelling for his job, so we decided not to pursue a long distance relationship. During this time, however, we maintained a really close friendship. \n When he had finished travelling and finally settled in, still 4 hours away, we started seeing each other a couple times a month, sometimes more, and decided to start dating again. It also happened that a couple months after this, a change in my job required me to travel to his new city every week. I'm usually there between 2-4 days a week, so despite the distance, we get to see each other quite regularly. \n Up until a few months ago, everything was seemingly great with us. We would occasionally discuss our future, together, and I think we both saw marriage in the future. These discussions forced me to start really analyzing our relationship and making sure that this was the man that I really wanted to spend the rest of my life with. There were things that had always been an issue between us (primarily his lack of affection and romanticism) that we would occasionally discuss, but now I was finding myself thinking of these things as deal breakers. I brought this up to him, and of course he says he wants to work on it, but suddenly I find myself realizing that if he's never been this way and done the types of things that I'm looking for from my partner, then that's just not who he is. I'm not wanting to change him, or ask him to change who he fundamentally is for me. \n It's crazy that I've made it this far in life, and I've never actually had to end a serious relationship. I've already got planned all I want to say, but the distance between us seems to complicate things. If he lived nearby, I'd go to his house, tell him, and leave. With our schedules now, when I'm in his city, staying at his house, we don't see each other until 9 or 10 pm. I know this has to be face-to-face, so should I tell him when he gets home from work the first night I'm there, then leave for a hotel? Should I try to spend a couple of good days with him, and tell him on my last day there? \n I'll be driving up Wednesday morning, and was planning on doing this this week, but I just remembered that one of his best, and only, friends is visiting him this weekend from the other side of the country. I don't want to ruin what would otherwise be a fun weekend for him, but I'm also not sure if this might not be the best time to do it. This way, he'll have a good friend with him and not be forced to deal with this alone. \n He is really a great guy, and I love him tremendously. I'm sure that this is going to come as a shock, and could possibly devastate him. I hate having to do something, knowing it's going to hurt someone I care about.	My boyfriend lives 4 hours away. I spend 3 days a week at his house, traveling for my job. It's time to break up. Do I do it on my first, or last, day there? Also, should I do it before, or after, a close friend of his is about to visit him for the weekend??	560	56	relationship_advice
"I'm a male age 21. My girlfriend of 2 years recently made contact with her biological family once she turned 18. She had never seen or heard from any of them since she was born. It turns out she has 3 older brothers, all of whom have some level of instability and arrest records. Her bipolar biological mother became pregnant with her after being raped by her crack dealer. Her older brothers, despite being in their late 20s and early 30s and having multiple children still all live with their mother. There has been a history of domestic violence at their house among them as well. \n So since these people have come back into her life, she has obviously been excited. She never had any siblings and her adoptive parents have been abusive. She tries to see her biological family as much as she can and goes to many fun events with her brothers (to which I am not invited). I have only met one of her brothers at a dinner, a 31 year old father of two who spent the night talking about how he had to beat up one of his friends once, and yelling at his 3 year old daughter for spilling sauce on the table. \n Needless to say, I feel like I'm being pushed out of her life, since the time she used to spend with me, she is now spending with her new family, which makes me uncomfortable because I just dont trust them. Something is off about them, and I dont feel she is safe with them. But since nothing bad has happened yet, I dont really have an argument. She told me today ""you are equally as important to me as they are."" When in the past she used to tell me I was the most important person in her world. \n I'm not jealous or clingy, my issue is really just that I feel that her brothers are changing her. Her general demeanor has gotten worse, they convinced her she likely has bipolar disorder since it runs in the family and now she has been having more mood swings because of it. I brought this up with her and her response was to get very mad that I dont approve of these people who are important to her leading to a huge fight that we later resolved. \n We talk less and spend less time together since she is usually with them instead of with me. Its just a weird situation I never thought I would have to deal with. I know they are her biological brothers, but I honestly cant stop viewing them as males who might potentially see her in a sexual context because they didn't grow up together. \n I feel like I'm losing her to this weird situation where I have no right to complain, but only have a general sense that something is off."	girlfriend's adoptive family is coming back into her life and having a negative effect on her and I cant bring it up without making her unhappy.	484	26	relationship_advice
I'm normally a level-headed person, but when I start to care about someone, I get kind of crazy. My boyfriend and I have been friends for a while and I watched him go through a really bad relationship, which ended maybe three or four months ago. We recently admitted that we were interested in each other and this past weekend finally agreed to be together. We're both really happy with it. Me especially. The problem is that I, apparently, am absolutely insane with trust and jealousy issues. \n How do I get over my trust issues? It's at that point that I've been looking at her Facebook and getting hurt over him liking a picture of hers. The smallest things, him talking about her or our mutual friends bringing her up, make me feel really bad about myself. \n I wanna fix this before the relationship progresses. I'm worried if I alert him to my insanity, he'll back out and break up with me. I'm worried if I don't talk to him about it, it'll come out later in the relationship and really blow up in my face.	I'm insanely jealous of my boyfriend's exgirlfriend, and I really need help getting over my jealousy/trust issues without scaring him off.	186	21	relationship_advice
Orginal Post]( \n Well I did it today, I told him I want to move on. He told me that he's seeing someone else and 'please don't be mad.' He just couldn't let me go without one last blow of abuse? I'm actually a bit angry he found someone else so easily because he 'loved me'. But I don't really care. It's a dull pain....like pulling out a wisdom tooth. I realize that after all the years of abuse, he realized he could no longer control me so he moved onto someone he can control. \n There is something I do need to know, is this anger I feel in my tummy a pain of loss? Or the fact that I stayed in it for so long, only for me to be stomped on like dirt to the very end? I really hope I'm not still in love with that maniac, but why won't this pain disappear? Its only been a few hours... so I'm hoping i'll wake up and feel new.... \n To continue, without you guys, I would've taken my life for someone who really didn't care. I would've died a thoughtless death. And the kicker is, I would've died a thoughtless death to someone who didn't even have the thoughtfulness to say he moved on earlier..... and he still 'wants to be friends.' \n I want another burger, doesn't mean I'm going to eat it. \nThank you.	I thank you all for help, but will this pain ever go away?	236	13	relationship_advice

"I pride myself [22F] on being a pretty sane girlfriend/fiance. I try to also give my partner [25M] the benefit of the doubt, that he loves me, etc. (We've been together for 4 years; engaged for 1. Our wedding is this coming Saturday.) \n With that said, he got a stripper at his bachelor party. Which I didn't know about. \n The stripper isn't the issue. It's that the groomsmen planning the party didn't feel it was necessary to ask if I was ok with having a private stripper come to their hotel room and perform some BDSM shit on my future husband.  no judgement to the BDSM community \n When I asked this groomsmen the day after (we're all pretty good friends) if they had a stripper at the party, he lied to me and said they hadn't. It was only when I found a picture on this friend's phone of it that I knew it happened. (He had me going through his other pics of the night; I wasn't just searching his phone for the record). \n Also, when I tried to talk to my fiance about this, he told me I was overreacting because ""we had had joking conversations about strippers at his bachelor party."" So I guess I was supposed to just know that it was a possibility, which, to be fair, I did. But jokes do not equal seriousness. Possibilities are different to me than definites. \n In all fairness, it also was apparently a ""spur of the moment"" thing to hire her. None of the groomsmen had planned on it; they were just really drunk and rolling (drugs not a big deal to me). This might then be the place where I have an issue; my fiance was there when the idea struck and didn't feel any semblance of doubt that it'd be fine with me. \n He also said he was going to tell me at an undetermined moment, although when I was out with him and all his friends talking about the party with them he made no mention of it. He said no one felt the need to check with me because they ""assumed I would be cool with it."" If it was understood that I would be fine, why wouldn't he have just brought it up when we were talking about the party with his friends? And why would our friend lie to my face about it when I asked him? And why wasn't that the moment when my fiance would jump in and say, ""Yeah, we did get a stripper""? \n I'm not saying I don't trust my fiance. I know nothing out-of-line happened. I simply feel disrespected. I'm apparently ""cool enough"" for them to assume I'll be understanding about having a little fun on his night, but I'm not cool enough to deserve a straight answer when I ask about said fun. \n I feel pretty crazy and out of character writing this. I'm just not sure what to say to him to make him understand why I'm upset. He feels like I'm overreacting, which in all fairness, I am. At the same time, I can't help feeling how I do about what has happened, and it seems to me that it's somehow not a big deal to him because, in his words, I ""have no reason to feel that way."" \n If the tables were turned and my friends were the stripper-hiring type, I probably would have checked with him beforehand. (But that's me in a hypothetical situation, and I don't actually know how exactly I would act. All I know is how I would want to act, and what I want in return.)"	I'm overreacting to an unexpected stripper; my fiance and the bachelor party planner weren't up front with me about hiring her. \n ***Note: the quotation marks are meant to serve as his dialogue with me, not meant to come across as mocking him or me being sarcastic	608	46	relationship_advice
i have been seeing a girl for the past month, and I must admit despite me I actually get along with her. \n We had 3 dates ( I want one per week max, to lazy for more than that).

"My boyfriend and I met last summer and have been dating 8months now. He's graduating from ROTC and moving on to Army flight school in December. I'll be graduating university in December and then moving onto a masters program in the summer. I'm his first serious GF, but I ended a (unhealthy) long term relationship about a year ago. \n Let me tell you about him. He's amazing. He makes me incredibly happy and we laugh all the time. He's so supportive and easy to communicate with. He's super passionate about his career (aerial reinforcement for combat troops) and mine (occupational therapy) which I love about him. We share very similar views on most things and can talk about things rationally when we disagree. Basically, I just love him. \n Honestly, military life really scares me and isn't what I was planning for myself at all. Right off the bat I'm committing to at least 3 years of long distance (probably more) with at least 3 deployments. He also plans on moving up the ranks and has a 20 year plan for his military career. That's terrifying for me. I always pictured myself staying in a rural area where I can have my family close and sustain ourselves food wise. That just wouldn't be possible with the path he wants. \n Another road block for us is that I'm not comfortable with guns, particularly around untrained civilians and children. I feel like the risk of an accident does not out weigh the benefit of having them in case of an emergency. He disagrees. I'm fine with him having his guns now, but (if we were to stay together) I can see guns becoming a major point of contention in our relationship. \n We've had a really positive and open line of communication about all these issues, but our conversations basically turn into ""we'll handle it when we get to that point."" He's very conscious about my reservations now, but I can see him being a lot less cooperative in the future."	My boyfriend is in the army, I'm committing to at least 3 years long distance and a 20year career with the military. That really scares me as it's nothing like the life I imagined for myself. He's a wonderful guy and I don't want to lose him, but I feel like there's an inevitable end to this relationship because of his lack of compromise.	337	64	relationship_advice
Frist some background. While I was growing up and even in to my adult life my father belittled me at every opportunity and it has left me with horribly low self-esteem. I was told over and over again that I was stupid and never did anything right and those voices remain now even after he has died. Adding to my issues with relationships I\u2019ve had almost every relationship I've been in end because of cheating or the girl finding someone else usually ending things with me after some form of emotional cheating. I\u2019m starting to feel like this has broken my ability to trust anyone and I know it is not healthy. \n What is happing now has to do with \u201cSally\u201d a girl I started a relationship with just 2 months ago but quickly am feeling the pain of my past bubbling up to the surface. I had recently ended a relationship of 3 years when things started growing between Sally and me. I feel I should mention that my ex broke things off with me between the day my dad died and his funeral 2 weeks later. \n In the beginning things with sally were great and my mind was always at ease. If Sally was at school or at her place it was no big deal to me I just went about my day usually always texting back and forth. Now just over 2 months in, nothing much has changed but yet I find myself threatened by almost all her guy friends. One night a week or so ago she was at her place, which is rare, and told me she was chatting with a guy she used to date on Facebook and for some reason since that night I feel as if I\u2019m going to lose her at any second. In school Sally has been getting help from her guy friends to help her finish her Geology degree because I don't have the math skill. She is doing more advanced math and science then I had ever dreamed of which may be feeding my inferiority complex because I can\u2019t help her even if I wanted to. \n Sally has never done anything to make my mind question her the way that it has been this past week and I want it to stop. I've discussed this openly with her and she told me that I have nothing to worry about. I believe and trust her it\u2019s just that my self-doubt won\u2019t shut the hell up.

So about a year ago my roommate (25/m) gets back in touch with his high-school crush. I get introduced and she is around for a few weeks. Long story short, my roommate smothers the hell out of her, confesses his love for her, and she flees. To give a full story she also wasn't being exactly clear on her feelings in the matter (but I feel safe in saying that much of the blame rests of my roommate's poor handling of the situation). She was also still living with her ex. \n So this girl is pretty big on online chatting and texting, so she ended up keeping in contact with me with casual chats about this or that over the course about a year. She is still living with her ex, for financial reasons (shes a poor college student with no parental support), and that  appears  to be normal, all I know is what she tells me. \n Then last week (all though texting/chatting mind you) a normal conversation veers into sexual territory when she starts talking about her couple lesbian experiences. I end up teasing/flirting with her. Now every conversation is extremely sexual in nature (we are probably both venting sexual tension [I haven't had a partner in about that same year's timespan]). It has escalated to the point where we are exchanging pictures and pretty much sexting. I'm thinking that casual sex isn't out of the question here. However, seems like there are alot of string attached mostly in regards to my roommate. I think I mentioned it awhile back that me and her chat from time to time, but realistically he has no idea whats going on. I could also see him finding out leading to a relatively dramatic and unpleasant confrontation as he was never entirely very mature about it in the first place. What say you reddit?

"Throwaway for obvious reasons. \n My now ex gf, broke up with me about 2 weeks ago due to an argument we had (we have been on and off for the past 4 years). I told her this last time coming back into the relationship, that this was my last straw, if she or I ended it again, I was out for good. \n The argument happened because of many issues, attitudes, tones, sex, ect. We fight and clash on almost everything. The girl that I once saw as my future wife, I could no longer see as that anymore, but I still love her with all of my heart. I was upfront and honest with her and told her that I love her with everything that I am, but I no longer see us married in the near future because of the way we argue and clash on a daily basis. (She wanted me to get her a promise ring for Christmas) \n After I told her this, she broke it off with me and that was that. Fastforward a couple days later, she texts me and says she wants to remain friends and I agreed because in the past we didn't remain friends and that was extremely hard on both of us, to lose the one person that we could talk to about everything. (I forgot to mention she has a lot of family issues right now, Her Dad divorced her mom and left the family for another, and we had just attended 3 funerals in the past 6 months for her family). I made it clear to her that I was there for her through all of it, but she said she was depressed, didn't want to do anything affectionate-wise, was angry all the time, and just wanted to basically punch stuff. \n GETTING BACK TO THE MAIN ISSUE: She said she wanted to stay friends but she keeps posting stuff on facebook. Some of her latest posts are as follows: \n -A shared post about ""To the guy who stopped appreciating the girl he loves"" \n -A Shared post about ""You need to spoil your women to keep them"" \n -""The best apology is a changed behavior"" \n My thinking is, if you wanted to stay friends, you have to stay friendly, right? This isn't friendly, and when I see her posts on facebook, it just instantly ruins my day. My friends and family see me having a hard time through this break up and they are all starting to hate her because of what she is doing. \n I want to bring it up to her and tell her that she needs to stop posting stuff like that, but who am I to say that to her? It's her facebook and she can post whatever she wants. I have no idea how to go about this."	Gf broke up with me, wanted to stay friends, isn't staying friendly with me. \n EDIT 1 - I forgot to mention, we have a Monday/Wednesday night class together.

So my ex broke up with me. She says she doesn't even completely understand her feelings or even if she made the right choice. It's been tough but not much I can do but move forward. I asked her to tell me she doesn't love me, isn't in love with me any more, or that there isn't any us in the future. She said she doesn't want to say that even though she says I shouldn't be hung up on this. What could that possibly mean? \n The split was her decision and choice, something she wanted. And she says she has my best interests at heart. She even said not getting over this was unhealthy. If she didn't want to be together and wants the best for me why won't she just hurt me to make this easier? Does the fact she won't say those things mean anything, negative or positive? \n I can provide additional information as needed but I don't want to convolute the question if possible.	ex gf won't say things I need to hear to completely put this in the past. if she wants the best and thinks it's unhealthy to not move forward why won't tell me something that will help me?	168	38	relationship_advice

"I work very closely with a pretty cool girl. We see each pretty much without fail every day and we work as a team to get our job done 5 days a week, 8 hours a day. We've been doing that for about 6 months now. Of course when you spend that much time with someone you're inevitably going to develop an attraction. We just started hanging out by ourselves and watching movies yesterday back at my place and it took a lot of me to not want to try and hold her hand while we were watching Mary and Max or maybe give her a kiss goodnight when she left. I wouldn't be opposed to having a dating relationship even just a casual one. But I do know one thing: \n I understand the complications that can arise because of a workplace romance. With the amount of time we see each other, if things were to go south, there would be a lot of awkward moments and that's just not what I want in a professional setting. Basically, I agree with the ""don't shit where you eat"" mentality. Whether or not I strictly adhere to it is another thing... \n However, while I know it's not the best thing to try and act out on my feelings, is it smart/healthy to just flat out ignore how I feel? I feel like that would just be like bottling up feelings of anger until it eventually blew up in my face. Do I tell anyone here about it and risk playing Chinese telephone with our small group? Do I have to suck it up and keep it my little secret for the rest of our time working together? \n I bring up that last question because she's moving away in 9 months. Does having a time limit on any sort of an intimate relationship with her change the dynamics of us? What I mean is: is it more condonable knowing that we would have a finite time together to attempt any sort of relationship if any?"	I'm conflicted about acting on a workplace crush. Is it healthy for me to wall-off my feelings and just ignore them? Or can I say something knowing she'll be gone in a little bit?	342	34	relationship_advice

"Let me begin by saying my girlfriend is brilliant. You know when people use the expression, ""it doesn't take a rocket scientist?"" ""Chloe"" IS a rocket scientist. Not a proverbial rocket scientist either - that's actually her job. She is also physically quite attractive. I know, I know - I'm her boyfriend so I'm biased just a touch but she is tall, slender, has great big green eyes and gorgeous naturally curly hair. \n There is something about Chloe, however, that flies in the face of all the brain power my girl has working for her - she is COMPLETELY naive about men. She has no concept whatsoever that they're hitting on her, and she's oblivious to the fact that her reactions to them could easily be construed as her flirting back. I trust that Chloe won't cheat on me, but she regularly crosses social ""boundaries"" and I fear she's going to put herself in situations that could escalate from awkward to downright dangerous. \n Case in point: we went to a Super Bowl party yesterday. One of the guys there came up to her and introduced himself and was asking her about herself etc. She happily chatted away, asking him about himself as well and so on. After a bit she excused herself and came and sat on my lap on the sofa to watch the rest of the game. This guy saw us together, saw us holding hands, but he kept his eye on her the rest of the party. As we were leaving he said goodbye to her and that he'd like to keep in touch and asked if she was on Facebook. She said she was and he could find her on the host's friends list. It took less than an hour for him to add her as a friend and he has already asked her to hang out and maybe see a movie with him. \n I explained to her how that made me uncomfortable and how this guy was clearly hitting on her and, bless her, she seemed totally baffled by the concept. Her response was, ""he saw us together, he knows I have a boyfriend."" When I said that it obviously didn't matter to him, she asked if I thought she would cheat on me. I don't think she would, so her reasoning is that if it takes two to cheat and one person doesn't want to, where is my concern? \n She agreed not to carry on additional conversations with this guy, and I appreciate that, but I would prefer that she understand where I'm coming from on this and not just accommodate me to be nice. Like I said, I worry she'll get herself into a situation at some point she can't reason her way out of. \n Any advice on how to communicate this?"	my (M29) otherwise brilliant GF (F25) is oblivious to how men communicate with her, and how she sometimes presents herself back. How do I help encourage her to be a little more streetsmart? We've been together about eight months. \n EDIT: format issues	469	42	relationship_advice
I don't think I'm relationship-type.  I'm also insecure about my level of femininity. \nMen that I meet (work/socially) are hardly ever single.  The ones who are and that I get to know, I almost always develop a crush, but try so hard to hide it that they just end up becoming a good friend of mine.  They usually make it clear that they are attracted to me, but I disregard it.  I make it so easy to be comfortable with, the start sharing secrets and life stories and I do the same.  And that's where I know I screw up.  I also think I am headstrong, brazen and outspoken.  I'm very opinionated.  Also, I'm not as feminine (clothing) as other women.  I wear makeup, do cute hairstyles, wear lipstick, do my nails, wear jewelry, I have a perfume collection, etc.  But I do not wear skirts, dresses, or heels and open-toed shoes.  I think it is all beautiful, but I feel so alien like with it on.   I'm not a tomboy, I just don't like super girly attire.  I've had a male friend tell me that he and a lot of other men would date me if I was more feminine and submissive. \nAlso, I've dated a couple of guys in the past who refuse to get serious with me.  They don't take me seriously romantically.  It seems like they'll try to hook up (9/10 times I'm not putting out) but not make anything exclusive.  I'm starting to feel real insecure.  Am I crazy and just don't know it?  Do men really only date super feminine women?  Am I too friendly?  How can I become more comfortable?  What do men like?  I'm at a age where I want to be in a relationship and fall in love, but I'm not sure if someone will ever accept me for me.  Sorry for the pity party.  I've been single for so long, I have to accept it is my fault.	I can't get a date, not feminine enough, too outspoken, will someone ever like me for me or should I change?	328	21	relationship_advice
Been doing LDR, only 2 hours away though, both about to finish college and I'm excited to finally live together but I feel like we never fully moved past our breakup. Understandably she's been gradually gaining trust and love for me again. I was a complete fool. I hate that I cut her loose and will take a long time to forgive myself. She once asked if we should talk about our time apart, and I said I didn't think I could handle it. I understand the self-destructive phase that often happens when someone has their heart broken for the first time (or at all), but I'm afraid of the pain that conversation will bring on both of us. Maybe my imagination is torturing me? I don't want us to lose respect for each other by sharing our stories. \n I also have some emotional scars from my first gf taking our breakup pretty hard and hooking up with people to get back at me. I was 17. She was a self-respective person before I got involved with her. I thought I gave her a fair breakup but before I knew it she was handing out HJs and BJs and texting me after terrible sex. I was devastated. I still cared about her and couldn't help but feel horribly guilty for her actions. I've forgiven myself now because they were her decisions, yet those feelings still haunt me. \n I feel like I should share this with my lady to help explain why talking about our time apart is such a fearful idea for me. Of course I'm worried she'll feel like I'm making assumptions about her based on my ex's actions. I'm hyper protective and paranoid when she goes out with or without me. I don't know what she got into during her dark phase, I'm afraid to find out, but I hate feeling like there's a side of her everyone else knows about. There's still healing to be done for both of us, so how can I go about this so we (or just I) can move on? \n Dare I open Pandora's Box or just talk about the Box itself??	Been with gf 4 years total, broke up briefly 2 years ago. I keep thinking about our time apart. Had an ex in high school who used her body for revenge and told me the details which haunt me to this day.  Curious and afraid to talk about that brief breakup.	360	51	relationship_advice
"I've been casual friends with one of my ex's best friends for years, but for whatever reason we have ""clicked"" recently and have been spending a good part of every day together since. Up until that point I had been very adamant about not becoming romantically involved with anyone. My ex and I have been split up for over a year and have maintained a civil friendship out of necessity (don't want to go into too many details on here). \nI've always been very cynical about love & relationships, and this man has been totally changing my thoughts on all of that.

Today I shouted at my gf full volume. I had only shouted at her once before as far as I can remember, during a bad argument in the car. \n I didn't shout for long or anything today, no swearing or anything either, and I calmed down quickly. She'd been needling me and teasing me and she knew she was annoying me (she somewhat jokingly said it was fun teasing me as I get annoyed easily) and when she continued after saying that I got annoyed and shouted at her. All I said to her was 'Can you just quit it?! You're annoying me, just stop!' (full volume) then I walked out of the room. \n She was shocked.\nThe words she used to describe it were 'ugly' and 'disgusting'. \n In my family I've been shouted at a number of times... I don't see it as a big thing - definitely not nice, but not the end of the world either. \n After I had a minute or two to calm down I walked back in and tried to apologise for getting annoyed but she wouldn't accept my apologies. She walked out of the room and sat down in the next room then after a minute or so I went to try apologise again. She said she felt was feeling sick and left soon after. \n What's your opinion?\nIs shouting at your SO such a big faux pas (though always better to avoid obviously) or is she over sensitive?

This is a throwaway, so I'm going to be brutally honest about everything, because if I've ever needed help in my life it's right now. \n So I met this girl two weeks ago. I was hammered at a party and a mutual friend brought her over. As soon as I saw her I was enamored by her. The girl (let's call her Carly) is exactly my type, and I just got a warm feeling by looking at her. Now I have extreme anxiety when it comes to romance, so I walked up to her group and waited for our mutual friend to introduce us. She did, and after a while of talking we hit it off and I could tell Carly was into me. Later on Carly left the party with her friends, but ended up texting me later at 2am. Carly came over and we did nothing but talk from 2am-6am. That was the longest conversation I have had with someone in a very, very long time. We only ended up kissing and holding hands when I walked her home, because I didn't want to hook up because I wanted to establish that this wasn't going to be like that. \n However... \n Once I sobered up I started questioning if Carly is really into me or was she just drunk. It was mid term week so I was swamped anyways, and ended up not texting her until the next Sunday a week later (fuck up #1?). We had a good conversation for a while but she ended up not responding. Okay then. That Saturday I texted her and asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner (this is the first time I asked a girl out on a date in 5 years). She didn't answer for a few hours but when she did she said she couldn't, which is okay. Later on that night at the party she finds me out of nowhere, and it looked as if she came by just to say hi. We talked for about 10 minutes and then she left for the bar. I wasn't going to drunk text her looking desperate, so I didn't text her later that night. Today I texted her just to say hi and see if she'd like to get dinner or something, but she just didn't answer. And when I was on facebook today talking in a group chat, I saw she was online on her phone so she definitely saw the text. \n Please, if anyone is out there, I need help. I'm so fucking lonely. Did I wait too long to text Carly? Does it sound like she's actually into me? And most importantly, what do I do now? Also for transparency, I'll be posting this in a few subs as I need advice and my friends aren't helpful. I have an anxiety disorder if that matters at all.	lonely. really into a girl just met. seems like she is into me. isn't texting back when i know she sees the messages. what do?	483	25	relationship_advice
"A couple years ago as I was graduating from college I met a pretty awesome chick. We clicked, spent a lot of time together, and ended up in a relationship. Incidentally this was my first serious relationship and her fifth or something along those lines. \n Things were awesome for the first several months, as you might expect. Having somebody to talk to and do things with was pretty awesome, not to mention the time we spent screwing each other's brains out. It was fun, we were happy, and life was great. \n About a year into things we both started feeling under-appreciated and ultimately we broke up. Despite this she continued pursuing me and we eventually reconnected and resumed the relationship a couple months later, though it felt like there was something missing that I couldn't put my finger on. \n To make a long story short life started kicking my ass around Fall of last year. This resulted in me getting depressed and, still missing that illusive component of our earlier relationship, I tried to break up with her. My reasoning was that while I didn't really want to break up it just wasn't fair to keep stringing her along if I was unsure of anything. She wanted nothing to do with that and eventually we decided to be less serious, though under no circumstances should we be seeing other people. \n Two months later, around the Holidays she jetted down to her mom's house and ended up canceling some plans we had made in order to stay down there longer. We usually did most of our talking over IM but she was offline for most of that week and then the following week it was impossible to get more than a few words out of her. \n This is about the time that one of my friends contacted me to ask if we had broken up since he'd just seen her picture on a dating site. It looks like the profile had been opened about a month prior, ouch. \n So I contacted her, asked her if she was done (guess so) and arranged for her to pick her stuff up. She did the ""I still want to be friends thing"" and so on, I maintained that we should go our separate ways. \n At this point it's been over 4 months. I am still reminded of her multiple times a day and get the (sometimes  literally ) gut-wrenching reminder that she's gone. I've taken the prescribed actions (delete facebook, hit the gym, avoid contact) and yet it doesn't seem to be helping. \n I've dated a bit, not an easy task since I'm a bit introverted and not necessarily very physically attractive, but I digress. This has only served to reinforce the idea that I've lost something that I'll never find again with somebody else. Intellectually I know this isn't necessarily the case and I do think I'm better off without her but that doesn't seem to jive with my stomach tying itself up in knots every time I run across something that brings back memories. \n This. Fucking. Sucks. What do I do now?"	Still hurting, confused on where to go from here.	520	9	relationship_advice
I'm a [45/f] who would like to reach out to [45/m] that I had a relationship with many years ago when we were in college. I am married, and the last I knew he is also. I am not looking for a hook up or anything like that. I am friends with his brother on fb, but haven't been able to find him online, nor do I have a phone # or anything. I don't think the brother would be helpful putting us in touch, so I do not want to ask him, although I would not be completely opposed to the idea. I do have an email and have emailed him, but haven't received a response. Not sure if the email address is old, or if he just wants nothing to do with me, although when I saw him years ago he didn't appear to hate me.  :) We had a pleasant conversation.\n I know it seems strange to want to be in touch, but our relationship/friendship meant a lot to me. I was the one who broke it off because he did not have his act together and I was ready for  a serious relationship. I would like to see how he is doing. Maybe it has something to do with getting older, but I would hate for life to pass by and not make some kind of effort. I do know where he lives and have considered sending a letter, but I wouldn't want his SO to see the letter and get the wrong idea. I feel sad that I have no contact with him since he was a very special person to me. Not sure if anything can be done.	I would like to get in touch with someone, but not sure how to do it.

I am sure this gets reposted every month or so, but a cursory search did not yield what I wanted so I am posting this anyway. \n I am a 29(m), was dating my 28(f) girlfriend for 2.5 years.  We broke up last March, were both graduating from grad school... she got an amazing job in Houston that would be a minimum of 3 years there... she pretty much made me an ultimatum, I could either commit to moving with her or we should break up.  I just couldn't do it- was not ready I guess... seemed like a huge decision to make for someone else and I was worried I would not be happy.  If I am being honest with myself I really just needed to grow up a little.  I ended up moving across the country, we saw each other a few times since the breakup and hooked up, kept in contact through skype, then a few weeks ago she cut off contact.  Found out through a friend she was dating some new guy, have been a total mess ever since. \n I won't go into more detail but can say that in the last few months I made the decision that she was worth moving for but it seemed like it was too late... and now it is.  She is an amazing girl and I do not know if I will ever find someone else like her; I think the feelings are worse because I know it is my fault.  I have slept with a bunch of girls since the breakup but it is just so joyless for me- it feels like none of them can compare. \n So are there success stories?  Would especially love people my age-ish (late 20s) who broke up and still managed to find someone else as good or better than their ex.  It just feels so hopeless sometimes.

Since we have been back together i wouldn't describe our relationship as anything less than perfect, we RARELY argue and if we do it's a small disagreement that we get over in minutes.

"Throwaway. I was showing my boyfriend a pinterest board of mine and trying to help him understand that I need encouragement, and I said something like, ""you could tell me how pretty something is,"" and he told me that he doesn't know how to quantify ""pretty."" I asked him if that meant he found nothing pretty and he said that was correct. And so that I wasn't misunderstanding, I asked him if that meant I was not pretty to him. I can't remember his exact words but it was essentially, that's accurate. I asked him if any woman was pretty to him, and he said no, that he doesn't know how to measure something like that. That's just not how his mind works. I'm okay now with him not finding me pretty, as long as no other woman is pretty to him. I'm certain he's heterosexual. He says that he is attracted to me and that I am attractive and he finds me beautiful, but he's more attracted to personality than looks, though looks are a part of what attracts him.

"My brother drinks/partys a lot, and sometimes when he gets really messed up he has really bad fits of anger.

Hello! \n May it is useful to tell a bit about myself. I'm a 20-year old graphic designer from The Netherlands and I visit Japan often. I got offered a good job in Tokyo and will start there in September. My girlfriend is from The Philippines but moved to Japan a year ago together with her mom and sister. We love each other a lot and always chat during the day in Skype in the night (due to time difference). However yesterday she said maybe we should be friends instead of lovers. We had plans to eventually move in together (she still lives at home but wants to move out) and are very serious about our relationship. Her mom doesn't like her dating a 'foreigner' and want her to focus on her career (I don't see why you can't focus on your career and have a relationship? Im always supporting her a lot). I know she wants to stay together and she still loves me a lot but her mom is making it impossible for her. \n How can I deal with this? I don't want to break up (and neither does she).

Apologies as this might be a relatively long one. \n Around a week ago my long term girlfriend broke up with me. I had seen something coming as she moved back home to another country over summer and stopped messaging me as much as she normally would, up to days at a time. She eventually Skyped me in the middle of my day at work because I made her (she wanted to wait until I'd left work but I knew something was wrong as she said we needed to talk), and she broke up with me over a call. Bearing in mind we had never ever had any problems before in any kind of serious capacity and been very happy with eachother, this knocked me for six. \n The reasoning she gave over the phone was that she didn't feel the same about me and had fallen out of love with me. She also felt guilty that she didn't miss me like she thought she should (background, we have done long term over summer before with no issues). \n This to me felt like it came out of nowhere as normally she preaches to always be honest with eachother and open but she hadn't spoken about this to any of either of our friends and has only spoken to friends back home that don't know me. She, to the date of writing about a week later, hasn't told her parents that we broke up either. \n She wanted to go on a break until September when she feels like she can reassess her feelings but I don't know how I'm supposed to go two and a half months on a wire not knowing whether i'm to leave or stay, and i'm not sure what to do. She says that she still loves me and wants to stay in contact as friends even if we do break up, but honestly I can say that I don't think I knew love until I'd been in a relationship with her and I don't know if I can do that. \n I asked her straight if she was seeing anyone else and she said she wasn't and I think I believe her on that but I don't know what to do with myself. \n I've spoken with her on and off for the past few days for a few hours and tried to get more information about what might have caused this or how this happened but she refuses to tell me anything else, just that she doesn't feel the same. \n She told me she's unsure about what to do at the moment. After I spoke to one of her friends saying I was distraught, she messaged me saying she's not sure if she made the right choice breaking up with me. \n I'm not sure what I'm hoping for as an answer to this thread, If anyone can give me some advice on what to say to her or how to proceed from here or maybe even someone has experienced something like this before and knows what she's going through, anything would be appreciated as I'm lost without her, she was my best friend.	girlfriend broke up as she 'doesn't feel the same any more' out of nowhere but is still undecided	524	18	relationship_advice

IMO, I'd ask the other girl for copies of the texts you had between each other. Maybe show your wife what was said. Don't hide anything and print out your cell phone records to show that all of the texts are accounted for. \n I know phones have software you can export your texting logs. It's worth a shot. \n I wouldn't do it though if inappropriate things were said. \n Also, what about blocking that friend's number via your cell phone provider. Only costs a few dollars and up to 30 lines you can do. \n But there are 3 sides to every story. I wonder what the texts really said.

"I met an amazing woman named ""T"" in mid December of 2015. We dated for less than a month before she left to study abroad for the, now ending, spring semester. In our time together I fell for T, but gave her the option of whether or not to continue things electronically while she was away. \n She chose to continue our relationship and we Skyped almost everyday for 3 months becoming extremely intimate in this time. T consistently told me about how comfortable she was with me, how I was the first guy in her life to treat her right, and that she was content waiting for a physical relationship until she came home. She gave me no reason to worry about us as she fell asleep to the sound of my voice on many occasions after our conversations due to the time difference. We would spend hours talking about how much of a fantastic time we would have upon her return home. \n After a few trips away from campus her communication became spotty, to which she preemptively apologized for a handful of times. After her communication became worse I sent her a message saying that she didn't need to be sorry as I understand that her enjoying her time away was more important than constantly concerning herself with keeping in constant contact with me. The following day (early April) she broke up with me over a Skype call claiming that she ""was not ready to be in a serious relationship"". Two of her best friends (whom I am very close with as well) are just as confused as I am as this behavior is very much unlike T. Since our breakup I have attempted limited contact (about 4 text messages), however everything I send is read and subsequently ignored. \n Before our breakup this was the best relationship I had the pleasure of being in regardless of the bulk of our time being long distance. She returns home within the week, and I have no idea what to say or what to expect, or even if she'll see me considering she's been ignoring me all month."

"The good (with her) \n I say she's perfect, and she pretty much is to me. She is  extremely  kind, she is pretty attractive, very much into me, very kind family, very talkative, liked by my family, good friends, good conversations, good sex, same interests, everything is good. \n The bad (with her) \n The only problems with her would be that she is slightly socially awkward, she doesn't really have any super close friends, she has slight depression problems, and although she supports my sexual fetishes, she's not really into them. So really there isn't much that is wrong with her. \n The Problem \n I know people would kill to be in a relationship like mine. I'm very thankful for it and I really do love her very much. However, I am 21 and have been in long-term relationships for the past 5 years of my life. I broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years to be with her. As a result, I feel like I'm missing out on a lot when it comes to the dating scene. I really want to get out there and see what it's like to be single--it seems very exciting. The thought of going out to talk to girls with my friends just seems like great fun, and I think that if I enter into a life commitment with my girlfriend I will have regrets later in life for never experiencing this. \n As a result, I have cheated on her twice. I feel like a shitbag and every time I think about what I've done I become very upset. The first time was in March 2011 and I told her afterwards. She obviously became very upset and said that if it happened again she wouldn't be able to stay with me, and has had small trust issues ever since. Well, about a week ago, I got drunk and cheated on her again. I justified it to myself at the time by making the conscious decision to not go to ""home plate"" with the girl. Not okay, I know. I haven't told her because I know it will absolutely tear her apart. \n The Only Solution, Right? \n I need to break up with her. I don't think I need to tell her I cheated on her again. What do you all think? \n The Problem With My Solution \n God, I really do love her. I really feel like I could spend the rest of my life with her, but not with the ""what if"" feeling. She is so kind and sweet, and has never crossed me at all. Just recently she admitted to logging into my facebook to read my messages. She genuinely felt bad and apologized profusely. That's the worst she can do. She's  that  good. I hate to think about hurting her so badly. In addition, I know I will also feel terrible being without her. \n So Why Are You Writing This Here? \n I'm writing this here because I can't do this on my own. I need to know that I'm not insane or that I'm not alone. I also need to know  how  to do it. \n \n When?  She just spent a ton of money on me for Christmas, and my gift to her requires a follow-up in January. \n \n Where?  She lives about an hour away from me during school but drives to see me every weekend. I don't want to do it while she's visiting me though. I'm home for the holidays and go home some weekends. \n \n How?  What do I say to her? How do I do this in order to hurt her the least? I want to be friends with her, but past experience tells me that doesn't work."	My perfect girlfriend and I are very much in love with each other. But due to me cheating and being too interested in the single life, I need to end things. Is that normal and how do I do it? \n Seriously guys, thanks for reading, even if you don't respond. It really does a lot for me knowing that at least somebody knows what I'm feeling.	615	66	relationship_advice
For the longest time in my marriage, I was extremely serious about not having any type of affair or overt attraction to other women. I've realized that I'm really lucky to be married to a wonderfully attractive, charismatic and ambitious woman, and I'd keep myself from doing much more than just slightly internally admiring another woman. \n Unfortunately, that's kind of changed in recent months. While my wife and I have a great marriage, nothing is perfect, and there have been a few minor issues. Minor communication issues seem to crop up frequently, which inevitably lead to some brief arguments. Nothing out of the ordinary in any marriage. But the thing that has been a big issue for me over the past year or two is the lack of attention, affection and sex from my wife. \n Part of the problem is that she has a normal 40 hour a week job, and I have a job where I mainly work from home. When she gets home, I'm like a little puppy who has been waiting all day to see her. However, she's beat down from the day and just wants to lie on the couch all night and keep herself buried in her iPhone or laptop. I'm dying for any type of conversation or attention, but I feel ignored. \n I'll be blunt, I'd really like more sex from her. And not just in terms of frequency, but in terms of creativity and kink. When we do have sex (maybe two to three times a month), it's the same old song and dance, almost like playing the same game of Simon Says over and over. We've been married a good while now, and I'd really like to get more kinky and do new things, something that she's stated quite clearly she's not into. I can't even describe how tough this is, because she is an amazingly attractive women and I'd really like to do a whole lot more and explore our sexuality far more. But even if she wasn't into doing that, just some more conversation and light affection would still go a long ways. It's hard to get that when she's camped out on the couch all night and shutting me out. \n And yes, of course, I've talked with her about my concerns. If she does pay attention to what I have to say, she seems to only say what's necessary and kick the can down the road. She's even admitted to this, resorting to the explanation that she's just too tired to deal with it. Thing is, I want to deal with it. I fear that if I continue to go without attention and affection, and most importantly some steamy sex, I'll begin to start looking elsewhere. To a small extent, I already have. In the past when an opportunity arisen to have flirty small talk with another woman, I'd find a way to escape the situation. These days, I find myself lingering more and fantasizing about the possibilities. And I won't lie, it's kind of a rush and a turn on. \n Everything else in our marriage is great. We get along great, share the same goals, have the same plans and outlook for life, and are awesome partners on so many things. I just foresee this becoming a big issue if it isn't resolved in some way soon, I'm just hoping to find the way to fix it before it does.	Been married for seven years in a mostly happy and well-functioning marriage, but a few issues are making me feel the urge to look elsewhere for sex and affection.	572	29	relationship_advice
I know it's terrible, but I snooped on my boyfriend's search history today and found transexual porn on his computer. \n I know invading his privacy is wrong and unforgivable but what I've seen cannot be unseen at this point. I've found what seemed like a 5-10 links in a row of all shemale and tranny porn videos, which means he must have gotten off on a whole session. \n What surprises me is that he has always claimed he was straight and whenever I asked if he'd be into an MMF, he said he just isn't attracted to men and would never want to sleep with a man. HOWEVER, he has a lot of gay mannerisms that are hard to ignore when you first meet him. I initially thought he was blatantly homosexual just from the way he talked and I don't think I ever fully rid of that speculation in my mind ever since. \n I guess what I'm asking is: is there a chance he might be into men? or is transexual porn something that a lot of straight guys are into watching (making it totally unalarming)? \n How can I bring this up swiftly without telling him I found it on his search history?	"found transexual/""shemale"" porn on my boyfriend's computer. I've always speculated that he might be gay, although he claims he's not when asked. Do straight guys usually watch this kind of porn?

Okay so here's the deal. I am absolutely consumed by this girl that I met only a few months ago and we hit it off excellently and quickly. I used to do this thing where I would lie to people and tell them stuff that wasn't true so that they would like me more. It seems so stupid but I was lonely so I was desperate I guess. I didn't do it with her until I told her a simple thing. That I had gone to see RENT live in Atlanta. I don't know why I told her that. It's not like she is a theatre geek or even interested in musical theatre. It was a stupid lie. So then only two or so weeks ago I told her that I had lied about that and how terrible I felt (I really did. Felt just horrible and sick) and she was sort of stoic and said that it was okay. I told her that it wouldn't happen again. She asked if I knew that I didn't have to with her. Lie that is. And I told her yes and all and that was the end of it except for a few times where I brought it up and told her that I still feel bad that I did that. \n Now, today I was over at her house and we were talking and eventually something about school came up and I told her that I had told the teacher that she gave me her tests (she took the class I am taking last year.) This isn't true. The teacher mentioned how people had gotten ahold of past tests and all but I never even gave any input into the conversation. When I told her this I didn't even think for a second about it. I didn't think before I said it. I didn't have a mental process that encompassed something like, 'I will tell her this because it will make me seem cool or something and she will like me more.' I didn't even stop. It just came out. Then I noticed. This is where I went wrong. Where I should have corrected myself I just ignored it and went on. I didn't have to lie again to make it work because of its simplicity I guess. But then later today I started remembering our conversation and that bit came into memory and I started to feel that sick feeling. Disgusted with myself and feeling terrible that I had lied to her, even if it was something so simple and menial. I told her about it and she is fine with it, especially that I told her and all but that doesn't help to qualm my nerves about the whole thing. \n What I really want is to not have that stupid impulse to say something false. I don't know how or why it happened today because I really stopped doing it even with other people and I feel so comfortable with her that I shouldn't have any negative impulses like this. The question really is what can I do to stop this from happening again? I hate feeling this way and if this continues happening, eventually my word will mean nothing to her.	Lied about something really just plain stupid that didn't even matter but it still made me feel terrible. I came clean and all (didn't help make me feel less terrible about it) but how do I stop? \n I am male and 16 if that changes anything btw.	542	47	relationship_advice
"My girl, who I could say is my first real love, has recently broken up with me. She decided to end things because she though I cheated on her at a musical festival she chose not to attend. Not only did I not cheat on her, but she never even gave me a chance to explain myself or even ask me what really happened. Now, before all of these events leading to our seperation, she had been hanging out with another guy and his friend a lot. I would constantly see snapchats, and different social media items showing them together. All the while, I was never told about her going out with him all the time and she never even really bothered to mention it to me. Then, after we had already had a previous engagment planned, she calls me early in the day and tells me she has gotten called into work. No big deal, until I see her riding around by herself with said fellow. Now I never had a problem with her hanging out with another guy, because I trusted her and believed she was truly mine. However, after I had been lied too in order for her to see him instead of me, i had to question her on it. I asked if there was anything between the two of them, and if there was some hidden feelings that I should be aware of. She looked me right in the eyes and said, \n          ""Diabeticboy12, I love you to pieces and I would never hide something like that from you. I was already off work when he offered to pick me up so I went with him. I realy did intend to call you! I'm not going to lie to you, he has hinted at it and tried to hold my hand but I've shut him down everytime."" \n And then I thought, a teenage girl without one second to even text her boyfriend and let me know whats going on? There wasn't a single way for her to get a hold of me at anytime, even when she was just riding in his truck? I really did lose some trust for her and I questioned the entire situation. \n Fast forward to the events and rumour leading to our break up. My friends and I all decide to head out to a party about three days after the split. They all tell me I should go out and have a good time, and guess who happens to be at the same party. Holding hands with said guy she had been so shady about. \n Now my question for you Reddit, do you think she is doing that as a way to get back at me for supposedly cheating, or did she take the rumour of cheating without giving me a chance to talk or really explain as a way out for this new guy? \n It just hurts so much to think that she's probably wanted this new guy for so long, but had to make me look like the bad guy to get him. Especially someone she promised had no place in her heart. So what do you all think?"	My exgirlfriend acted really shady about a guy, believed a fake rumour and started seeing said guy.

"What I feel is weird, I'm not sure if it's immature or there's something 'deeper' to dig in. \n I've been dating my boyfriend for about 3 years. We've had our fights in the past, but we talked about it no matter how big a deal it was and always solved our relationship problems. However, I have a hard time forgetting things he did that annoyed me, giving in to  truly  forgive him. Mostly the cause is him not telling me things when I ask during fights, or only saying them after I ask him on maybe 3 different ocassions. Sometimes those things were a big deal to me, and hiding them for a long time just made it worse, made me more resentful... \n Also it's like a cycle (maybe related to my hormonal changes doing my period as well) where I just go with the philosophy ""if he does something that bothers you that much, just let go, chill for now and enjoy your relationship"" but then I wake up one day thinking that he will lie to me one of these days and I can't keep that thought out of my head and end up hating him for something he never did... \n I know I'm really stupid, you can save that comment.

I've gotten myself into a doozy of a situation here, and I could really use some advice. My long term boyfriend and I have had plans to move in together since the beginning of our relationship, which was literally when we were fifteen years old. (We are both now 20.) It was the first serious relationship for both of us. We have had a turbulent relationship, in which the good is great and the bad is awful. We are both strong personalities and we get into massive fights. Through it all though we always made up and we really enjoyed each other's company. \n That is, until last year, when I went to school across the country and we did long distance for a year. My boyfriend insists that I cheated on him and now doesn't believe a word I say about anything. I NEVER cheated, though I admit I am a teller of white lies out of convenience and this has really dilapidated the trust in our relationship. Things got progressively worse, but the plan was that we would move in together at the end of summer. \n We fight constantly, often saying we hate each other. However, we knew if we didn't get a place together, the relationship would be definitely over. We've practically been together since childhood, we wanted to make it work. This was something we were not ready for in the summer, but now that I'm here with him in a different place, I know I'm ready. I can't live like this. We go about our days in denial pretending maybe that we don't hate each other, but we get in the worst screaming fights without warning. \n My parents have spent so much time, money, and energy getting us this place. I'm too ashamed to tell them what's happening. They payed for all the furniture, my half of the rent, etc. They can't afford this place without the other half of the rent they are expecting from my boyfriend. They have already given our landlord the entire years rent in post-dated checks, relying on my boyfriend to hand the rest over to me every month. I can't leave, as i've signed a years lease. (Which he is not on.) \n I've just moved to the area and I have few friends. The friends I do have already have their own living arrangements. I don't think I could find someone off of craigslist even, as this is a small apartment. And I've already spent all my money furnishing it for a couple. \n I feel so trapped. I don't know what to do, and I feel like I'm living on a hell on earth. None of my friends or family know about this situation. I'm so ashamed that I was in denial about this failing relationship, and that i've let it get this out of control. Our fights are now worse than ever, and last for days. We try to hurt each other as bad as we can, and it has even on occasion become physical. This is wrecking my self-esteem and mental health. I have this constant sense of dread.

"Hello all! I need advice. \n If this is not the appropriate sub please inform me. \n Info: I(M24) have been in a committed relationship w/ my gf(F21) for almost 15 months now, dating for about 4 months before moving in together, which was desired strongly by both parties at the time, and all is well on that front. This is my first long term relationship and I've only dated 2 women prior(both less than 3 months). And I lost my v card when I was 21yrs old(perhaps relevant) \n Here's the issue. I love women and I LOVE my girlfriend. When i'm physically with(in the vicinity of) my girlfriend, 95% of the time, I am HAPPY and content. Whenever I am not physical near her, I mentally lust after other woman. This wouldn't be such a huge issue IMO if it weren't for the fact that I'll go so far as planning and thinking through breaking up with her so I can be with/pursue other women, both sexually and emotionally. I am aware that men do this, however i feel as though I might be a little more extreme about it. \n She is aware of my ""distractions"", as I make it a point to be 100% transparent with her at all times. I have never cheated and do not intend to do so. \n My confusion stems from my lack of experience and an utter lack of guides on the subject of relationships(to my knowledge). When I am on my own I think about her on rare occasion, there is usually some BEAUTIFUL woman stealing my attention at any given time. Our sex life is not what I'd like; I am voracious and experimental, where she has little to no libido(due mostly to depression, which is being professionally treated). When we started dating we humped like jack-rabbits, eventually settling into making love 3 times a week at least(and I wasn't satisfied w/ that, masturbating twice daily), recently I've gone almost a week and a half without sexual attention from her. \n I LOVE her. When I am with this woman, I feel strong, vulnerable and invincible simultaneously. I often find myself feeling protective of her(like a parent) and when I notice this it upsets me. She, to her confession, is in love with me and wants to spend the rest of her life with me, occasionally bringing up the idea of marriage, though we are both agreed on our lack of readiness towards that end. \n I have been told by friends and family that I am young and full of testosterone, and that to fantasize is normal. And i accept that truth. But I am unhappy and confused about my emotions and whenever I try to sort this out for myself I literally get head-aches. It is hard to at one minute feel completely in love and ready to settle down and then immediately a reverse and STRONG DESIRE to be single and ""free""(this switch happens multiple times everyday) and It is becoming a source for an amount of depression that I am very unfamiliar with. \n I post to r/relationships_advice because, while I'm not positive, I am under the impression that my unhappiness isn't stemming solely from a stale sex life and perhaps is a common occurrence for [young] men in their first SERIOUS relationships. \n I seek advice regarding whether or not; 1) this is normal. or 2) this is just my body/mind informing me that this relationship has run its course. \n Thanks! :)"	First LT relationship, constantly fantasizing about other woman.	580	8	relationship_advice
"So my girlfriend's a college sophomore, about to turn 20. The mother's nice to talk to, but the conversation stays topical, and this is a good thing, because I don't like her. \n Why? Because I think she's a waste of space. She is disabled, and so that sounds bad, but even if she somehow got the use of her legs back, I doubt she'd be any different, or any less a waste of space. She uses it as an excuse to not do anything with her life but watch Television and lord over others, namely my girlfriend, who is living at home to save on room/board. \n Their family's breadwinner lost his job when his company decided to fire everyone over 40. They lost the civil lawsuit court case, so now he's (the only one) earning money for every member of the family of four as a delivery boy and bus driver. She screeches at him like a banshee when he leaves for work,  screaming that he's abandoning her,  even though he's the only one making any money in the whole household. I can hear this over the background of my girlfriend and my's video chats. She's so embarrassed that she won't video chat with me anymore on the chance that it happens again. \n The house is literally falling apart- there are holes in the walls, appliances that are broken or failing, and she  refuses  to allow the father to cancel their extensive DV-R/high end cable HD package. For about 1/3rd of the price of this package, she could get a transit service to take her places like the park or to get outside, to do something,  anything , but apparently she has zero interest in doing so, and spends entire days without going outdoors. Reality TV is all she cares about. \n Now, this wouldn't bother me much- I just would have my own quiet opinion of the mother, keep the conversation civil, and generally not care about what she chooses to do with her life.  BUT  my girlfriend is forced to house-sit and keep her company. Which the mother has demanded. To the point that I'm not allowed to take her out. They like me- they invite me over a lot, they seem to think I'm absolutely awesome. But while the mother has previously been fine staying by herself for days at a time, she is growing increasingly controlling over her daughter, who is now being forced indoors to watch nothing but Reality TV all day. Getting my girlfriend to spend a day with me initially was easy. Now it's like pulling teeth, with week-ahead notification required, and that's only ""if she feels like it."" \n It's driving me mad, it's pushing me away from my girlfriend, it makes me feel like either she's using her mother as an excuse to not do things (which my girlfriend denies is the case), or she's putting me behind her mother/I'm not important enough for her to stand up to her mother over."	Overcontrolling mother isn't allowing daughter to spend time with me, has veto power over any time we spend together, requires weeks of notification in advance, it's driving me mad. \n What do I do? How do I broach this with my girlfriend that she needs to stand up to her mother and not let the mother veto at random?	499	58	relationship_advice
"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year now, yet I feel like I've numbed to everything. He's going through a very rough patch right now since he has been dealing with derealization for about 5 months now. He also has synesthesia - while synethesia on it's own isn't a bad thing, combined with derealization it makes everything look horrible. \n Every conversation starts about how well or how horribly he's been doing that day, and if it's gotten better or worse.

First off, let me start off by saying I love my girl, and care about her very much. But here's the deal: I have realized I no longer possess physical attraction to her. She has gained weight since we have been together (Year and a half now), and it has not gone unnoticed. I have let her know that I have been doing thinking and we need to talk, and she sounded scared. I then told her I don't have any intentions of breaking up with her right now, we just need to talk. She has agreed and is eager to fix what is wrong in the relationship. So, tomorrow we will be meeting to have a talk about things. I'm going to let her know that I love her, but am not physically attracted to her any longer, and that because physical attraction is a very important part of a relationship for me, that I wish for her to lose weight. I have every intention of working with her, as I am skinny and working towards gaining a little more muscle than I have. I hope the talk is open and can be received in an understandable way. If it doesn't work out, I feel I'll need to end the relationship. What do you guys think about this decision to talk to her to try and sort it out? How long should I wait before I end it if she doesn't lose weight? I will provide an update tomorrow sometime after the talk. I hope it goes well, and I hope she is willing. I don't want to sound like an ass about this, but I feel physical attraction is extremely necessary to a healthy relationship.  [	Going to talk to my girl about losing weight.

Hello, RA. This relationship had its ups and downs, especially in the first 6 months. Some of her actions fueled my insecurities so it was a hard time establishing a point where I could completely trust her.\nThis relationship turned intense and intimate, something that we both wanted and something we were happy with. She had a hard time opening up at the beginning because of fear of getting hurt, but recently, she was telling me many times how this relationship basically saved her and brought her back to her old positive self. (She used to be destructive). \n About two weeks ago, the thing that I was afraid of the most happened. We abruptly had to turn our relationship long-distance, because she wanted to move to another country (political asylum). It was something that I wasn't prepared for and I had many moments of being down and just trying to discuss with her my expectations, but it seems that every time I came off as insecure in her eyes. She would get agitated, angry, call me names and accuse me of not trusting her. That culminated in me breaking up, even though just a day before she was telling me how much she loves me, how much we're compatible and how much it is difficult for her that she's leaving. I understood that, and I fucked shit up by breaking up in anger. Anyway, the night after I sent her a message saying that I'm sorry and just tried to be completely honest. I really don't want her out of my life. I was pushing the conversation, telling her how I feel only to get from her that I am obsessive, creepy and that I am dependent on one person. She also told me that I need to have some self-respect which only led to me being even more disappointed. \n The thing is, she wants time, she thought she had something stable in the past few months, and then all of a sudden how she doesn't feel like it anymore. What's even worse is that she's in the other country right now, doing business of her own and constantly not wanting to talk to me because she's extremely busy. Political asylum stuff is really something stressful, I'm not making shit up. It's something her entire family is involved in.\nI feel terrible. I want my personal power back. She made me feel like that weak, wimpy, clingy guy in one minute after a year of fights, makeups, breakups and loving and caring moments. It's not like we've known each other for a month to label me like that. Please help me out with this. She is very important to me, but I don't want to jeopardize myself.	I want my girlfriend back. She is unsure. I need help coping with the loss.	457	15	relationship_advice
"I'm off at college in another state, and we were talking to each other over the phone about random things and she out of the blue said ""Wouldn't it just be easier if we got engaged?"". I thought she was totally joking at first, because she's joked around about that kind of stuff before, but she said she was being serious, or that maybe we could at least make a promise to each other or something, to get married after we graduated college. We have talked about marriage before, saying we could see being with the other, but never anything so concrete. I love her and care about her so much, but there's no way I could do something like this when I'm only 18. She just wants to make sure that the relationship is something that's here to last, and that we won't just finish college and suddenly break up. It felt to me like she was saying she wants to be with me to get married, or not at all, which she said sounded overly harsh and wasn't really what she meant. \n The other thing is that I don't know if we would be good together. I mean, I do care for her more than for probably any other individual in my life right now, but it's my first ever relationship! I still imagine being with other girls, dating other people sometimes. I know it sounds incredibly shallow or callous, but I don't know if I can commit to being with just one person ever in my entire life. I don't think that I would be as overjoyed as I should be, being married to somebody. \n I love spending time with her, but at the same time, it's not a passionate rollercoaster or anything. It can almost feel boring at times.  It's like eating comfort food. Reliable and will always be there for you, but I can't help wondering if there's something more? We mess around, but it's almost always the same type of thing, or some extremely slight variation on the same act. I want to feel crazy in love with someone, but I don't know if this is the most I can feel and I don't have enough experience to justify it, or if this isn't the right place for me. It sounds dumb to say I wish I were head over heels all of the time, but is it wrong for that? The sense I get is that she feels that way about me, and I might feel the same about her but I don't have anything to compare it to so I have no idea.\nAdvice?"

"So here is the deal. Im going do my best to describe my situation with it sounding like im bragging. I genuinely think this is relevant information. Seriously, im not an asshole.  Im 23 and I am no stranger to sex. I slept with upwards of 25 women and have no problem in that area. Im an attractive guy and have no problem meeting or picking up women. \n However, when it comes to relationships I run into serious problems. I don't know what it is, but every time a girl begins to really like me and I her, I begin to think to myself ""could I do better?"". From there it seems like I start to nit pick every detail about them until I convince myself that I really dont like her. I think ""maybe she's not attractive enough"" or ""she seems really clingy"". Even worse, when i see other women I think well if im in a relationship ill never be able to try and have sex with other women again. \n I dont know, it seems like as soon as girl likes me, I no longer like her.

This is an update to my  previous post . I don't think that he was lying, he seemed very open and worried about her. He helped me try and get ahold of her all night yesterday. \n Hannah came home last night at 2am; I was awake and very happy because I was worried. I know that she broke up with me but not knowing where she was or what she was doing was scary. \n Surprisingly, she was stoned and when I mentioned it admitted that she's been smoking pot for months but didn't tell me because she thought I'd think it was immature. I told her that that was ridiculous and she should have just told me, then she told met that it was the only thing that could make her eat nowadays. I've noticed that she's lost a ton of weight the past three months (she was thin in the first place), but never really thought about it as being negative. \n It was the first awkward interaction that we've ever had, and she told me that she just wanted to go to bed. I told her she could sleep in our room and I'd sleep on the couch, but she asked me to sleep with her. I'm still holding out for our relationship to work, so I accepted. We didn't have sex or even kiss, just kind of cuddled. This morning I woke up and she was gone. \n I'm at a loss at what to do. She hasn't answered any text messages or calls, and she isn't due to work today. I'm really worried.

"She was my best friend and first person I loved. I'm 18, she was 16, we never had sex. Or kissed for that matter. She wanted to keep it at holding hands/physical flirting, even though she I could tell by her signs that she really liked me. She even told me she loved me with no prompt from me. \n We've been growing apart as I've gone to college, and I poured my heart out to her, really deep stuff about how much I love her and how much I want to try to keep things going. She ignored it, so when she finally replied the next day (I knew she had seen it when i sent it) with a single heart, I told her that I knew she saw it when I sent it and that I was done. \n She was immature, this kind of thing had happened before. I told her that if she didn't want to try (she was the one who had stopped talking to me, I went to great lengths to try not to let anything change), I wasn't going to either. So she gets pissed and tells me how she doesn't even care, how it was all such a joke. \nI was nothing but the perfect guy as far as I know, I was fine with not even kissing. I wrote her sweet things so often, I told her how she was perfect and really devoted myself to her. \n We weren't even a real couple - she would tell me about how cute other guys were or about how she was going to this party where people just hook up.

We've been dating for about 3 months now. I feel like that's a bit long (I wanted 6-9 months). I brought it up to her, she told me that we'll do it after a year (give or take a few months) and that she's already started birth control. Sometimes it feels to me like she doesn't even want to it at all and is just pushing me away with it. We already go down on each other, so I don't know why it's such a big transition. We're both virgins. I've never pressured her into doing anything she wants, and don't plan on doing so. I just don't want to be stuck in a sexless relationship at this age. Is a year really too long?

I love my GF soooo much, but lately I have been getting the feeling that she is cheating on me. We use to have sex 6 to 10 times a week, less if she was mad at me, but now it has tapered down to practically nothing. I am talking four times a week max. Lately I have been browsing  /r/nofap , so I should be really attractive to her right now, but I am feeling the opposite. Anyway, the reason I am suspicious is because she has been texting a ton, but not to me. I also caught her taking nude pics in the shower. When I asked her what she was doing, she said she deletes them afterwards and just does it to boost her confidence and make her feel sexy. The last thing that makes me nervous is that she has been hanging out a ton with this guy from work. She says she isn't into him, and whenever I ask about it, she gets super defensive and we don't have sex for at least two days. What should I do? I am worried about bringing it up because she can get so crazy. Thanks.	GF is being sketch, but I still love her. Sex life has gone down the drain.	198	16	relationship_advice
We dated all through middle school and freshman year. Our parents were really good friends so we were together a lot.

He talks to me openly about everything and told me he likes one of my close friends. What do I do? I really, really like him.

Hello, so im [16/m]. And I've gotten into a position in two relationships where I'm not sure of what my next move will be. This all started when I began getting close to this first girl, we will call her Jane Doe. She is in my classes and she's not a 10 but sill alright. We have many things in common and I enjoy speding time with her. Since last summer she has been trying to upgrade our relationship to the next level althought I've kept her at bay. I can't go as far as to call her desperate but her efforts have been noted. This is kinda as a reverse friendzone as I'm not sure if I absolutley want to commit into a full reationship with her. We havent done much. Really, we only touched tongues after being dared during a game of spin the bottle (yeah we're kids like that) but it was not anything. By this I mean that she tried to make out with me but i kept my distance and stayed true to the dare.  (im not gay for anyone wondering). Other than that, I've cuddled with her once while watching a movie and went to her house a bunch of times during the summer. Okay, I went to her house a lot to the point were my friends started using the bros before hoes argument. At this point i was thinking with my penis. The only thing I would like to say about this is that her dad is SCARY. Like the man will make you shit your pants. You know, this dissuaded me from wanting to hurt her. When I went to her house I met the rest of her family and there was her sister. Let's call her Jenny. Now Jenny has an enourmous ass. Jenny resembles her younger sister but her ornaments (if you know what I mean) are more pronounced. Plus, this is a college girl. YES, you heard me right, a second year college girl. To place this simply, if I do anything with her my street cred will litteraly skyrocket, I seriously believe that I will be the coolest guy in school. So when I first met the sister, we got off to a good start and I got her snapchat. I snapchatted her a little (no nudes sorry (yet)) and then I started texting her. Now the original girl is super insecure about her sister takling to me. She freaked out and got mad after one of her friends saw me texting the sister once I convinced her it was an isolated incident but it wasn't. I've been texiting her everyday, this past week. And guess what, the sister likes me... She went on about how age wansn't an issue althought im pretty sure that this classifies as pedophilia LOL. Anyways my goal here is to , not take advantage, but kinda take advangae of the older sister (im kind of the victim here). In short I want to become the envy of all the guys in my grade  so I want to eventually grow my relatioship with the original. I'm not looking for a threesome here just to have two girls. This is where I need advice what do I tell each girl in order to make this work. This is where reddit comes in. Im open to all suggestions an will pot upadtes for you guys	I need to get two girls (Sisters) reddit comes in to help me cum hehehe....	571	15	relationship_advice
I just got out of a long relationship about six months ago, with infidelity on his part.  I shortly was able to find another guy, R. \n R is (seems!) great.  We've been together for about three months now and have all kinds of fun.  I don't want to gush, but I think he's awesome.  I have a couple of reservations, of course - no one is perfect. \n One of them is that R likes to remain friends with his ex-girlfriends.  He has four friends who he dated at one time, with varying levels of seriousness.  This makes me a bit uncomfortable, mainly because I don't really have any idea how one can remain friends with an ex.  I don't tend to - I tend to cut ties cleanly. \n Anyway, I have met three of these friends and I am getting more comfortable all the time.  I am not the jealous type usually, which helps, and the friends I have met all seem lovely and are interested in getting to know me.  They are in committed relationships, and they all dated R quite some time ago. \n However, the one I haven't met, G, I worry about.  They stopped seeing each other about a year ago, and he was hoping to start dating her again, shortly before we started seeing each other.  He changed his mind and started seeing me, and said that I am a much better person and he wanted to be with me. \n And he truly seems to really, really adore me, and I have no issues with how he treats me. \n However, G is not at all interested in meeting me.  And he has been texting her a bit the last few days.  I am fairly certain that it is innocent.  Fairly certain.  95%.  However, I would really like to know for sure. \n I don't think I would feel this way if it weren't for the fact that my ex cheated on me, and R was hoping to get back together with G shortly before meeting me, and R and G split only about a year ago. \n I feel that my options are: 1. talk to R about how he feels about G; 2. look at the texts and find out for sure. \n I really feel a bit shit about this, because I am fairly sure he isn't doing anything.  But he  has  been a little protective of his phone over the last few days, and when he talks about her his voice changes just slightly enough that I notice it.  But I know this may be distrust from my previous relationship leaking though :/	short term relationship and he's acting a bit protective of his phone, and has been texting a recent ex.

Well to start we're both seniors in highschool; been dating since Junior year (1.5 ish years) and shes going to college on the opposite coast (California-DC) at the end of August. \n We talked recently and we've agreed that long distance isn't for us because we dont have a goal in mind, plus we'd see each other maybe 3 times a year if we're lucky. I want to end things and open up the summer and focus on myself more before I go to college and start meeting other people, but shes giving a lot of push back when I bring up the fact that were gonna break up in nearly 3 months. I loved this girl for a long time, especially in Highschool, and things are good for us now, but i'm ready to find something new and move on to the next chapter, and I have no idea how to tell her or go through with it. \n Another concern of mine is how to handle it. Am I rational in thinking this or is it just me being silly? If so, how do I go about telling her I've lost interest, not in our friendship, but our relationship.

Little background first, we met freshman year of highschool. We were always friends but we really got to know each other towards the latter half of senior year. We both enjoyed volunteering at a local homeless shelter every week and we wound up spending a lot of time together there. We got to know each other really well, and we've been good friends since. Now the thing is, she's had a boyfriend for a little under two years now, and honestly the guy is the personification of an average dude. He's not overly good at anything, and nothing really makes him stand out from a crowd. He's a major killjoy and he's extremely awkward. She on the other hand is the complete opposite of that. She has just about every good quality I could possibly mention, and everyone who knows her likes her. She's going places in life and this guy is just weighing her down. One thing that made me wonder, was that if you're just friends with someone, there's always that distance between you, or there are obvious signs that you're just friends. She's never really done that, and we used to talk quite frequently. If we were in a group of people she would always talk to me over anyone else, even if her bf was there. She's given me a few signs that she might have feelings for me, but because of the boyfriend I'm not really sure. The last time I saw her I pulled her off to the side and talked to her about him. Her response was extremely positive, she wasn't the slightest bit upset. In fact she seemed happy that I told her how I really felt. She thanked me for doing so, and we've remained close ever since. We are currently attending separate colleges that are around 2 hours from each other. I don't know whether I should just wait for the relationships inevitable failure, or if I should try something else.

So to start, I'm not a ladies man at all. Never had a girlfriend, never been kissed. Generally women aren't attracted to me at all, but in one of my classes I met this girl who literally was a perfect 10, and she actually talked to me a lot and even flirted with me a bunch, enough so that I mustered enough courage to ask her out, to which she said yes. Fast forward, first date went great, we had an awesome time, but after that I got too excited and came off as clingy, so by the end of the second date she not so subtly implied she wasn't interested anymore. Ever since (around two months to be exact) I haven't been able to get her off my mind, however I'm not asking for advice to get her back because I've already accepted the fact that it is over between us. I need advice on how I can get over her and move on while not holding any negative feelings toward her. I don't like to hold grudges and I want to have nothing but positive thoughts towards her because she truly is a very sweet girl, but my instinctual coping mechanism is to try and put her down in my mind to get over her, and that doesn't feel very good to me.

My significant other and I have a close relationship, and by close I mean he has my login information to everything including my real reddit account meaning this is a throwaway.

It's the male conversations however that set him on edge and I understand but I don't know what else to say. I explain HOW I know them and HOW and WHEN we met and who they are, but other than that without him being able to view the conversation, then it goes a bit downhill. \n When using his computer as well, I put privacy on (Safari) and forgot to take it off when he came back so he was immediately was suspicious and asked what I was hiding or if I was at all in the first place. (I'm not good at lying, and I don't know what else to do when it concerns our relationship at this stage and I also need a puppy soon or at least access to one by May or June at least.) \n I'm not sure what to do because at this point I'm pretty sure if I told him the truth he wouldn't believe me and I am a bit tired of being put on the spot or made to feel bad when I've done nothing wrong.

"We have known each other our whole lives and I am leaving today after a week long vacation where I stayed at his family home. \n For a long time I liked him a lot, \nbutthroughout the years I've realized that he will never see me the same way. A couple years ago we smoked together and I basically jumped him but I was so inexperienced my performance was laughable. We're still friends and we've never talked about it but he's bitter about it. The week I was there his girlfriend would come over at night after work and spend the night and we would all hang out and talk and smoke and have a good time. But my last night I come to find out that she is still insanely jealous. Earlier in the week they had had an argument about me being in the house and he insisted there was nothing between us and so did I. But that night he comes out sits down and huffs ""She's still super jealous"". And I got pissed. He started going on about how since I had tried to hook up with him that time, it's ruining their relationship now. I sat there in shock. How could he say something like that? It was years ago, I'm a completely different person, and I don't even feel the same way any more. I tried telling him it's in the past and it was a mistake but he wouldn't drop it. In the end he asked me to go inside when she got there and I was fuming. All this wasn't my fault and there's nothing I can do about the way SHE feels. Both of them have told me about her jealousy issues and insecurities and I was like that's fine, we're in the same boat with that, but at the end of the day it's because he's a player. I grew up with him I saw it happen. They work together and he has ran through every other girl there and he doesn't understand why she's getting so frustrated. I told him to his face ""You're a player and she knows it"" and he didn't like that. I was at a loss like she saw you flirting with all these other girls and you don't get why she's so jealous?? I don't know, I want to tell him how I feel without causing strain on our relationship even though I know there's already some there. We are two very similar people and we've been through a lot of the same things anxiety, depression etc. He needs to know he can't just stir the pot and expect me to be okay with him blaming me."

I met my BF shortly after the last time I was with the FWB. I had known him for a few years before anything ever happened and I always found him attractive in many ways but when we finally got together, it was the most passion I have ever felt with anyone, every time.  We were never more than casual though. We never went on any dates, made any plans to, texted or talked on the phone.  It was strictly FWB. \n Shortly after I met my BF, life circumstances happened to where FWB and I stopped having the opportunity to meet up as we did before.  This was a good thing because I knew he wasn\u2019t looking for anything serious and this new guy I just met was great.  Things worked out to where we never had to have the \u201cI\u2019ve started seeing someone, we can\u2019t do this anymore\u201d talk. \n I am happy in my new relationship and things are getting more and more serious.  I have never cheated on anyone and wouldn't cheat now but I seriously can't stop thinking about the old fling. I mean, all the damn time. This makes me feel terrible inside, as if I am cheating emotionally. The thing is, I never had the chance to tell FWB I was developing (strong) feelings for him. We never talked about our feelings and he probably doesn't have a clue how I feel. Also, I think he may have the idea that I met my current boyfriend while things were still going on between us and I don't know why I care, but I do, and I don't want him thinking that. \n I feel like I just need to get so much off my chest with FWB but I don't think the feelings are requited and I'm happy with where my current relationship is going anyhow. We live in different cities so it is not like we can randomly run into each other easily but, we do have a ton of mutual friends who do mutual activities so there is that chance. \n So my question is, it ever a good idea to reach out for closure for something that was never really anything concrete? If I did reach out, it would be completely out of the blue for him since we haven't had any communication in months. Has that ever actually helped anyone move on?	"My relationship is/has gotten serious and I need to get over an ex-FWB who probably doesn't have a clue how I feel. I feel like I need ""closure"" and am wondering if I should reach out or not."	399	38	relationship_advice
"Hi Folks, \n I'm on a distance relation since 3 month. We learned eachother through a mutual friend while spend a weekend in Moscow. Nothing but making out a little happend there. I'm living in Germany, she came a few month later, we met, came together. Almost 3 month ago. \n Before she came to Germany we both agreed that we don't want to relation on distance, just enjoy our togetherness and that's it. But love came and things changed. We're seeing very regularly since then. I came to Moscow three more times, she will be here during the whole summer and she will most probably study in Germany from October. Not that hopeless. \n My issue is, that she is always extremly late. She always picks me up from the airport, firstly she was late for 1.5 hours, secondly for 2 hours. For my stay this time I asked her every day to be on time, because she is ruining my feeling of our reunion while everyone gets picked up and I'm sitting at the airport like an idiot. I begged for it. I threatened her with leaving immediately to a hotel if she isn't there. A minute before I left the baggage claim area she called me and told she is not there, she is so sorry, she had so much to do, there is so much traffic, bla bla bla. She was almost 2 hours late again. I don't know what to do, I miss her so much after our breaks and don't want to waste days with beeing pissed. I told her that she destroys some feelings of mine even when I'm fine the next day. She cried the whole drive to the apartment. \n She can't stay with me every night, because she has really conservative parents she can't tell about her boyfriend, she wouldn't be allowed to stay a night till marriage. So she leaves from time to time and comes back the next day. Yesterday she wanted to come at 9am, she wrote me on 11.30 that she overslept. Today she wanted to come ""around 10am"", while I'm writing this it is 12.30 now, her phone was turned off... now she just called me that her alarm was at 8, but she overslept again, she got up at 10 (for whatever reason didn't text or call me), and that she will leave house soon now. \n It is always like this. I feel like she takes me for granted. She always has an excuse, she almost never apologizes and when I complain she starts crying and ""please stop it/why do you want to make me sad"". \n I know she has a lot of responsibilities, I at least just want her to be on time when I'm at the airport and that she please calls me/texts me, that is not more than 30 seconds. I told her I'm not a thing to put in an apartment and take some sex and love whenever she feels like it. \n We had a bad arguement while I'm writing this article. She called me selfish, that I should work (owning an internet business) while waiting. She tries to share herself between everyone and while noone understands her and I should be her help I'm acting like everyone else. She just ended the call twice and turned off her phone now. \n I told that I understand her lack of time and the only thing I wish is a short message when she knows she will be late. \n I don't know what to do. Please tell me, am I holding too tightly? Is she right? Am I expecting too much?"	She is always late, informs me hours later when she will come. Calls me selfish, I wouldn't understand her. Am I expecting too much?	605	24	relationship_advice
"Excuse terrible thought development and structure) \n My girlfriend and I have been dating for close to a year and a half now, and on the surface everything is great. We get along great, we share the same interests, have knockout chemistry, and enjoy each other's company. We can't maintain a stable physical relationship in our situation, but besides that I would say we have all that it takes to have and maintain a healthy relationship. \n However there is a problem on my end. Whenever we hang out, or have just done so, I always feel very happy with the relationship and I love being in it. Whenever we are apart is a different story. All motivation and hope, as well as interest, seems to dwindle as the time between dates drags on. I start to become annoyed by parts of her personality, begin to notice our differences, most small, some large, and basically form a wall between her and I. She is extroverted while I am quite introverted so our ideas of how relationships should work don't always agree with each other. For example she obsesses over ""cute"" acts she sees other guys do on the internet, like birthday gifts, prom invites, etc; whereas, I am not a fan of those outward shows of affection (which she sites as a reason for her discontent whenever we address issues) because of my anxiety and shyness. \n That aside, it feels like I just can't get excited to go over for another date, even knowing that I'll end up happy after I get there. It's not that I'm not attracted to her or don't feel for her because I do. I love her as a person and a partner but something isn't clicking like it used to. \n College is coming up this fall and I feel like it may be influencing my feelings. The romanticizing of the whole ""college experience"" makes that aspect appealing to me, but I often times debate whether it's worth it to follow that path or to stay with my girlfriend (who is dead set on me being ""the one""). She is crazy about me and goes the extra mile to prove it, but it often makes me uncomfortable since I don't have the energy to constantly remind her in the same fashion. There have been times when I've felt I should just move on but guilt has stopped me cold. I, ideally don't want to break up but I feel like its getting harder and harder to rekindle the flame. How should I get by this?"	Having trouble finding excitement in relationship of one year. She is extroverted while I am introverted and it causes strife in expectations.

My boyfriend and I have been together for about 5 years and moved out together in January.

They have nothing in common and my boyfriends mother doesn't speak much English. And they come from completely different cultural backgrounds.

"as with all the others on here, no, your not. they were BOTH waaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyy over the line. i'm not quiet sure which i think is more disgusting, your ""friend"" or ""bf"". since if EITHER of them gave two shits about you, she wouldn't have be acting like a man-stealer (which from the sounds of things she is). sorry, but that's not a friend, that's a bitch and whore (at the very least she should be getting a VERY stern talking to, and i mean let her know EXACTLY what you think of that, and be blunt). as for the boy (and he is, a real man wouldn't stand with that, my fiancee would have booted her off his lap), he also gets a stern talking to. and i would break up with him if he can't give you a reasonable and sincere explanation (this also warrants just as strong a talking to as you gave her. something along the lines of ""what you just allowed to happen and did really bothered me, and i don't ever want you to let something get that far again. i understand that you can't control someone else's behaviour, but that was too far. care to explain what was going through your head at that time?""

I broke up with my So of 4 and and a half years this morning. We have been living together the last 2 years.

"Second post (link to the first in this one): \n I return with great news. I finally said it. I didn't say it how I wanted to, but I said it nonetheless. \n Or typed it, I guess. \n I was at work, and it just kinda hit me how amazing of a person he his, and how I've never met anyone like him (and I'm really good at boxing people into groups in my head because I'm an asshole). So I sent a relatively short text that just said he's awesome, I'm proud of him, and I love him. This was at 5am. \n Two hours later I get a text back. He called me sappy, and said he loved me back, don't rub it in. \n Plain and simple. \n I was so happy, I nearly cried. My eyes were watery. My co-worker asked what was going on. I told her. She went ""Aww. You kids."" \n So, that's (hopefully) the last I need to post here for awhile. Thanks again for all the advice and support. I'm really glad I got it off my chest, and I was a little surprised he said it in return without hesitation. I don't care if neither of us say it again for awhile. Who cares. It's not important.

"I started dating 'Trish' a few years ago. We dated for about 3.5 years, although during that time I broke up with her twice before we had a pretty much mutual break up. It was a rocky relationship, we had a lot of fights and she could be incredibly needy. On top of that, we were dating long distance (opposite ends of the country) for roughly half of the overall relationship time. I wanted to break up with her many times, but we did get along quite well. We were so up and down, sometimes we would get along great and other times we could both be so stubborn and grumpy that we would fight for days. Trish didn't smile a lot, she was a terrible drunk and none of my friends liked her at all. \n In contrast, I've now been dating 'Mandy' for roughly 1 year. She's amazing, we get along great, she's so forgiving, she helps me through my problems and she is actively helping me become a better person. She's a very bouncy, happy person. She doesn't hold grudges, she cheers everyone up and she's the life of the party. She's a great cook and she would do anything I every ask her to do for me. I try not to take advantage and I try to pay back all her favors of laundry and presents with flowers and work around her house. \n I'm considering marrying Mandy. There's one problem: SEX. \n Sex with Trish was never very good. She was stubborn as a mule with how she wanted things to go, which usually meant zero spontaneity. We had to plan it ahead of time and everything had to be just right. My roommate might come home? Well then no sex. It's February and the thermostat is too low? It's too cold for sex. She was also a huge masochist who always wanted to be tied up and spanked or it wasn't fun for her, and even if I did that kind of stuff for her it never felt 'real' enough for her because she thought I was only doing it to please her, not because I truly wanted to hurt her. \n The thing is, I thought (and still think) that she was unbelievably sexy. This 5'2"" 95 lb mixed race little black haired thing, my god. I would always fantasize about her and the things we would do together after we weren't long distance... only to be disappointed later when she wasn't into it. \n On the other hand, sex with Mandy is great. She is incredibly horny, and always down for sex. She's easy to please and will do whatever I want as long as I get her off (which I'm always able to do). The big problem is that I'm not physically attracted to her body. I'm not going to describe it but when she's naked I want to look away. I don't have any urge to have sex with her at all. I have to force myself or be very horny in a dark room to want to do it. And when we do have sex, I fantasize... usually about Trish. \n I don't know what to do anymore. I'm starting to feel like this could be a huge problem and I'm not going to consider marriage with her until I can get past her unattractive body, and get past constantly wanting to screw my ex. I need some advice."	I think about fucking my hot, bitchy ex while I fuck my amazing but unattractive current girlfriend.	574	17	relationship_advice

Been dating my 24f girlfriend for about 9 months, and now that she owns her own home she's constantly wanting me to come there, so I'm spending much more time at her house than ever before. \n Here's the thing. She's messy. I wouldn't go as far as to say dirty, but certainly not extremely clean, and she's very messy.. She only cleans when there's not enough room in the kitchen to do anything, so she has to.. The entire kitchen gets covered in dishes, boxes, pans from previous meals until there's no room left. I've noticed instead of cleaning, or putting anything away or in the sink/dishwasher, she simply makes piles throughout the house. Cloths, wine glasses, laundry, you name it, she doesn't put it away. \n I'm a very clean, neat, and tidy person. Very. So her house almost gives me anxiety and I find myself cleaning almost every time I go over to her house. I can't even surprise her with dinner, because I know I'll have to do a 1 hr clean job in kitchen, then clean a pan to cook with, and it makes it a 4 hour extravaganza. \n Her couch always has dishes, cloths, shoes, and mail... fucking mail. All over the place. \n How do I address her lack of cleanliness or being lazy without being rude? I've made comments before and she tells me not to be mean, but it's a bit disgusting and starting to bother me more and more. She is clean, and always well dressed, but the house... Another story.

Excuse the text block. I just don't really know where to start? \n So there's this boy I've known for a while now. We first started talking about two years back, and around that time, I had this huge crush on him. We talked every day, which resulted in him telling me a lot about this girl he was in love with/infatuated with. \n Long story short, he found out I liked him, but instead of no longer talking about her, he just did it more, which made me feel really shitty. I later found out it was because he didn't want me to have the wrong idea. \n We got over that. Skip ahead to the next year. \n I got a phone, and we moved from Skype chatting to texting. We texted every day, but he never acknowledged me at school, which was also really shitty. \n By the summer time, he had stopped talking to me almost completely. I called him out on it, he admitted I wasn't important to him, and I said I didn't really wanna be his friend any more, because I was picky about who I was friends with. He accepted it, saying he would still consider me his friend. I deleted his number and off of Facebook, Skype, Twitter, Instagram, etc etc. \n Skip to this year. It's only been a few months, and I still see him at school, but he's really cold to me? But I think that might just be how it is. It's still odd how we have a locker right next to each other, and he doesn't say a word to me, but whatever. \n In a moment of weakness, I get his number from a friend, and we started texting again. He still ignored the vast majority of my texts, and he still doesn't acknowledge me at school, so I can't really say much has changed. \n I suffer from anxiety, which makes talking to him really hard, as I can't help but feel I bother him. He definitely holds all the power in our conversations - I'm always the first person to text him, and he's always the end to end our conversations. \n Except the problem is I have really strong feelings for him. I don't think I've ever stopped. And it's probably more infatuation than anything else, but it still feels like more than that. \n I guess I want to know if he's worth it? And if he's not, how exactly do I go about cutting him out of my life? Because it's really hard.	This boy is kind of shitty to me, and I really want him to like me, but also to get rid of him. I just can't figure out how to do either. \n Edit: Ignore the typo in the title. I can't seem to figure out how to fix that.	423	49	relationship_advice

"Here's what is going on: \n Jorge and I have been dating for a little over a year.  He's the kindest person I've ever met, let alone man I've dated.  I've been told by my closest friends that I have horrible taste in men -- Jorge is the first boyfriend I've had that has met with any level of approval.  Everyone is always commenting on how lucky I am to have Jorge. \n Things between us right now are very boring.  I'm finishing a degree.  He works full time.  We live about an hour apart.  Most of the time we spend together is frittered away in one of three ways: (1) Homework for me and computer games for him, (2) Eating out together, (3) Watching the few TV shows or movies we can agree on. \n Notice that sex isn't on that list.  Jorge has a medical condition (not an STD) that has made sex impossible for the past two months.  The problem is temporary but not short-lived; it'll likely be at least another month before we get the all-clear to have penetrative intercourse. \n Even before the medical issue, we were down to about 2 times per month. \n We are planning to move in together in July of this year.  Living together was my idea.  I am now really getting anxious about it.

I don't know how to approach Jorge about this, given that we have this handicap right now.  Part of me just wants to run wild and have a bunch of ridiculous, funny, weird sex with attractive acquaintances.  Another part wants to strangle that first part to death, douse the remains with kerosine, and light a fucking match.  I thought I was done being ""young"" -- I had been looking forward to dating an older, more ""settled"" man for quite some time before I met Jorge. \n Can I have some opinions on how to approach this stuff with him?  I know I need to communicate with him, but there's a lot here.  I don't necessarily feel that I've been holding it in per se -- a lot of it is just hitting me all at once.

"I was wondering if anyone out there might help me overcome this weird feelings I get about my bf. We are both 27, in grad school for our PhD and have known each other since our first semester. We've been together for half a year. \n I am a very independent person, I have been living on my own since I was 20. My Bf however still lives with his parents. Now, I know this should not bother me, but it does. He does not know how to do laundry, or clean or take care of everyday stuff like getting your car checked. All of that is taken care of by his parents. He only has to do his stuff for uni and is otherwise free to pursue his hobbies. \n Because he still lives with them, I am never able to visit him, he always comes over to me. He says I cannot come over because his room is too messy (whatever that means?). \n When he's at my place, signs of this are also starting to show. He likes to cook and I really appreciate it when he does cook for us. But he leaves the kitchen an absolute mess everytime. I am fine with sharing work - one person cooks, the other cleans - but when I cook, he just sits at the computer and I have to clean anyway. When I ask him to help, he does, but reluctantly (which annoys me even more than just doing it myself).  Or there are situations like the one a few days ago, where I had a shower and my cats knocked over the bedroom trash can. He just sat on the bed and when I came out of the shower, he pointed at the trash and said ""your cats knocked it over"". Yeah I can see that, can you not just pick it up instead of staring at it for 10 minutes? It was just some tissues and candy wrappers. He avoids stuff like this all the time, and it's really getting on my nerves. \n His habit of ""fishing for compliments"" for really basic stuff feeds this feeling even more. I really appreciate when he cooks a nice meal and I frequently tell him how great it is, when we eat. But hearing ""those [food XY] I made, they were really great, huh?"" three days later just feels weird. \n Now, I feel really shallow to get annoyed by his lack of experience with housework and his need for validation. But I also really fear for our future, because at this point I cannot imagine living with him. I am beginning to see him as a child that needs to be taken care of and it's killing my attraction to him. \n He also told me recently that he is not interested in talking about my sexual fantasies, and that in fact he is not interested at all in talking about stuff that I find fascinating but he does not. So if I have a topic that I like but he doesn't, he just won't talk about it. This feels really immature to me, but he said I was being unreasonable, so I dropped the issue. I feel I just need to learn to accept him as he is, but it is getting increasingly difficult. \n So I am turning to reddit for help: How can I stop seeing him as a child that I have to pamper and how can I rekindle my attraction to him? He really is an awesome person, we are a great team in our hobby and I enjoy spending time with him when we do things he likes."

Now this came as a huge surprise to me as I had never gotten any hints that she wasn't having fun or enjoying my company. We have hooked up a good amount of times, gone on a couple fun dates, hung out at our local bar scene and hung out at both my house/her house. I know my question is almost impossible to answer because the only person who knows the actual reason is her, but I still want to know what other peoples opinions are. Her reasons were: a lot happening in her life, and doesn't think she can date anyone right now. Those sound so cliche to me, especially since I had never mentioned dating. She said she really doesn't have a good reason except she mentioned how her ex boyfriend of 3 years was back in town for the holidays and she kept running into him by chance, and that she is still having a hard time getting over him and that she hadn\u2019t realized that until she saw him. I had already guessed that as she had brought him up many times. He lives in another city and has a new gf, so I don\u2019t think she's trying to get back with him, but I really don't know. Does that seem plausible as a reason to blow me off after all the fun we had? Or does it sound more like an excuse. Has that happened to others? Or have you felt something similar? I'm worried that I just texted her too much and tried to take things too fast and drove her away. Her friends had told me she likes me, they also told me she would tell them every detail of our dates and that she was happy with them. She had even told me she likes me, although we were both drunk. It would be nice to hear some other people's opinions, or advice, or anything really lol. \n One last thing: I do understand people just get over things without much reason, but since I don't work that way it is super hard for me to understand. She was one of the coolest girls I've hung out with in a long time, we could be silly together, shared so many similar interests, yet also enough differences to keep it interesting. This really sucks, she was awesome, and I feel like I lost a friend. This seems to always happen to me, the girls I want to date don\u2019t want to date me, and the girls that want to date me I don\u2019t want to date. I realize the best move for me is to just move on, but I would still enjoy some input.	Girl I had been hanging out with for 7 weeks says we shouldn\u2019t hang out anymore because she doesn\u2019t want to lead me on, blames ex boyfriend. What are people\u2019s thoughts?	513	31	relationship_advice
First: I\u2019m in a long distance-long term relationship with a fellow I met four years ago online. He\u2019s absolutely amazing in person, but lately we\u2019ve done nothing but bicker and fight on Skype. Recently, I moved to a new city and got a new job and consequently new friends. He\u2019s been pissy about not being able to talk to me all the time and (to my own fault) sometimes I want to hang out with real people than sit alone in my room talking to him about things we will do instead of being out having fun. \n He\u2019s 22, I\u2019m 21 and we\u2019ve talked about marriage lots. The other day he told me he has huge plans for our relationship this year, when he asked if that\u2019s what I still wanted, I shrugged. He blankly looked at me and ended the call on Skype. Five minutes later he called back basically yelling at me that if I was in love with someone that\u2019s not how I should act and how terrible I am in this relationship (he goes on some pretty abusive rants when he\u2019s angry, he\u2019s even pushed me a couple times). \n But here\u2019s the real kicker, of all these new co-workers I\u2019ve been hanging out with I\u2019ve developed real feelings for one of them. We\u2019ve been to the movies (in groups) and I\u2019ve gone over to have a couple drinks with him and his roommates and it always ends in us staying up late talking about some movie/show/book. I kissed him once, a drunken mistake that I can\u2019t shake off. He knows I\u2019m in a relationship and is a complete gentleman about it, but has given me a choice: it\u2019s him or my boyfriend. \n Reddit, for the first time in years I feel like my SO isn\u2019t at the top of my priority list and it\u2019s freaking me out. I\u2019m going to visit him next week on our bi-yearly visit and I can\u2019t decide what to do! Part of me wants to ask for a break, just so we can both explore being young again before we can decide whether or not to make this relationship official. I know a part of me will always wonder what could\u2019ve happened with this new guy. He\u2019s basically the personality clone of my boyfriend while living in the same city! \n So really, what I\u2019m asking for is reassurance. Am I completely dooming my current relationship by asking for a break?	Have a long distance boyfriend who want to marry me, met new guy in town, really like him, want to ask boyfriend for a break to explore additional outcomes.	409	29	relationship_advice
I don't know what to do.  We ([29/M], [29/F]) have been dating for just a hair over a year.  I am completely in love with her personality, with her mind, with her smile and her sense of humor.  And she's pretty.  But she's somewhat overweight and has struggled with her weight her entire life.  I love her desperately but I'm afraid that her weight will come to be a problem. \n I got her to exercise with me for a while and we are trying to 'eat healthy' -- in both cases because it was something I wanted to do and didn't have much of an effect.  I'm worried.  If we go all the way, will her weight become more of a problem or less?  Obviously, you can't really answer this question for me but I'd love to hear from people in a similar experience. \n If it matters, I'm in relatively good shape and have typically dated more objectively attractive women in the past (but this girl is so incredible in so many ways!).  And she's probably 30-40 pounds overweight -- nothing that it's impossible to lose but it's probably unreasonable to expect people will get skinnier over time when the opposite is almost always true, especially given that it's a problem she's always struggled to deal with (she had stomach surgery a decade ago).  Any advice would be appreciated.	I'm in love with her but she's overweight and I'm worried I'll struggle with that for the rest of my life.	229	21	relationship_advice
"I will try to spare you all the details of the background that are irrelevant. \n I met a girl about 4 years ago in University, and after three weeks we started dating. Our relationship grew and it turned sexual after about 1.5 years (she was a virgin at 24, cultural thing). We moved in together during our student days. When I found a job on the other side of my country I moved there and she kept the house. We'd see eachother every few days (I had a company car so I could drive over whenever I wanted). We planned to get married, however she still wanted to do another Master's degree first. We agreed that it would be a good idea, and she opted to do this with her sister in Australia. The other side of the world for me (Europe). Her Master's was going to take about 2 years so it wouldn't be too much of an issue. Our love was strong and we knew we could make it. \n Over the first few months of being apart small cracks started to appear. Nothing of a adultrous nature with other people, but small annoyances over the distance came up. Communication has always been an issue for us as her native language is not mine, and her English isn't all that great. \n We hit a rough patch with a bunch of fights, but we got through them. \nAfter a while our relationship got worse and we put it on hold for the time being. I ended up kissing another girl and immediatly fessed up to my then ""ex"". She showed compassion and still said she cared loads for me. I told the other girl it wouldn't work out and we stopped seeing eachother. \n Ugh, this is getting long, lets get to the point. \n We got back together and I made plans to move to Melbourne next April. After a week of us discussing this she suddenly dropped of the radar. No email replies, no FB activity, phones are dead (apperantly one number was out of credit and disconnected, another also had a problem according to her, both go straight to voicemail), no more online skype activities, and NO mutual friends (she had almost no other friends in my country, and the ones that she had I cannot reach as they all have exotic names that I can't find online/in the phonebook). \n SO now what? How do I deal with this? It's been 4 weeks since I last contacted her. Nothing indicated her behaviour towards me, and I'm having trouble dealing with this. Should I let this rest and move on, or wait for her to get back to me? I checked local news and can't find anything that might have happened (although if there is a melbourne resident reading this and wants to help search, please PM me). \n IF this incident is not on purpose (e.g. something happened ot her) then I can live with it, if it's intentional I don't think I can go on with this. \n Some details \n Relationship length: 4 years \n Genders and ages M26/F27 \n Maybe an important note: she lives with her sister, and knowing her psyche well I strongly doubt she is with another guy (not denial, just wisdom)."	GF emigrated for study, keeping LDR, suddenly drops of the radar completely, unsure what to do, a bit angry if it's intentional.	544	22	relationship_advice
"Back story / information: My boyfriend and I have been together over two years. We live in separate apartments, him by himself, me with a roommate.  I also would like to apologize to those who find my storytelling strange, but this is my first real post to Reddit (I'm using a throw-away) and I'm not sure how to go about this. \n I am a generally clean person. Yes, I will allow dishes to pile in the sink, but only ones which have been properly rinsed out first and they don't stay for more than two days. Yes, I will let my laundry pile. Yes, I will be lazy and put off taking out the trash for a few days. Yes, I may skip on a morning shower or forget to brush my teeth before bed. But the point is I will actually complete these tasks in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle / bug-free living space. My boyfriend, not so much. \n To put it plainly, his apartment is a gross disaster. There are bugs everywhere (fly and gnats mostly, but a few roaches here and there); trash piled up on sofas, tables, etc; dishes in the sink from two over four weeks ago; dirty laundry piled in the kitchen; food left out from weeks ago; over 10 trashbags filled with garbage sitting on his front porch; cat piss on most couch pillows (his cat is having behavioral issues); and mold filling his bathroom sink drain (it no longer works). As for his lifestyle, he showers maybe once a week, brushes his teeth every 4 - 5 days (and he's a smoker), and his main dietary staples are energy drinks and Taco Bell. There are some days where I can't even kiss him because his breath is rancid and his teeth are bright yellow with days worth of food stains. \n I truly don't know what to do. I've asked him many times over the years to clean, and occasionally he will but it all ends up in bags on his porch. He absolutely will not do a thing unless I step in and start cleaning for him or declare us to have a ""cleaning day,"" in which he pouts throughout the entire time, complaining about how he's embarrassed I'm doing this / seeing the mess. I am not his mother, and I am certainly not his maid. I hate how I always have to be the authoritative figure in this, the one who finally puts the foot down and declare the place ""un-live-able."" And as for his habits, it's a similar situation. I'll drop hints repeatedly, but eventually I'll flat-out tell him his breath / teeth / BO is nasty and he needs to take care of it, which always leads to him becoming distant because he's embarrassed. \n Reddit, I am at my wit's end. I don't know what to do anymore. I love this man dearly. Our families have been talking marriage for several months now and I would love nothing more. In all honesty, this is the only serious issue which has ever come up in our relationship. But I'm scared, I don't want this behavior to continue after we've moved in together. I don't want to constantly feel like his mother, or a maid, but I also don't want to live in a disgusting house. I can't sleep in his apartment, hence the reason I'm writing this at 1:30am while sitting on his couch. I don't know what to do. I'm so scared and disgusted and overall freaked out, I'm at a complete loss. \n So please, Reddit. Help me out, here. What should I do? I am willing to answer all questions and / or clarify for those who need it!"	my boyfriend's apartment (and lifestyle habits) are absolutely disgusting, I'm tired of having to act like his mother in order for him to clean, but I don't know what else to do.	623	32	relationship_advice
Hey all, \n Today I found out that my girlfriend attended a 'no sugar' meeting in my town, and told people that I was addicted to sugar during the course of the meeting, my sugar addiction was then discussed amongst members of said group. I felt defamed by her because for starters I'm not at all addicted to sugar, and secondly even if I were addicted to anything I don't think it's right to tell people about it without my permission. \n I let her know how pissed off I was about it, but she kept telling me that I was in denial about my sugar addiction. I'm sitting there thinking wtf? What sugar addiction? Yeah I eat things with sugar in them from time to, but I'm not obese and I don't go nuts without sugar or have withdrawals the way I do with nicotine. Basically she got me really worked up and I just wanted her to say she was sorry and that be the end of it. \n But she wouldn't. And she wouldn't stop insisting that I had a sugar addiction. All I wanted was for her to see how that could affect me, and she didn't or refused to. Now she isn't talking to me, because she is upset with me. I asked her why on earth she is upset and she told me to figure it out. \n To check that I wasn't going crazy I got a second opinion from my parents, who completely understood why I would be mad about someone basically telling a lie to other people about me. And I even told her this, to which she replied that she told X about the situation  and he thinks I'm overreacting. X is a male friend of hers who she texts quite often and suspects me of being jealous of. \n So not only would she not apologise, she also used someone else to try to hurt me. At the moment she won't talk to me, because she is too angry with me for being upset with her and I offered to come over to her house to which she replied the door is locked. Am I going crazy? Is she right and I'm wrong? Why do I have to apologise now? Why does this always happen? \n She never apologises unless I apologise first.	girlfriend refuses to take responsibility for her actions, and never apologises.	388	11	relationship_advice
"A few years ago, I had a short lived relationship with a good friend I'd known for years (we'll call her Jane.) We never officially dated but talked a lot online and met three times. We never had sex or any kind. We made out till we were in our underwear, and one time I masturbated all over her. Thats the farthest things got. Jane was young (still 18, so legal) and didnt have much sexual experience (her ex fingered her badly and some play on her part with him but thats it.). I was 21 and had had some, but not that much. \n I broke things off with her when I realized I was still in love with my ex girlfriend. I am ashamed to say she was a rebound and I was very interested in her physically. I also didnt know then that I was polyamourus, or that being poly was even a thing, so I thought I could only choose one of them, and I felt more emotionally close to my ex than her, though I did have feelings for Jane. We both realized that we took things too fast. But during the relationship she never said no and was always very into whatever we did. I also have all chat records from that time period and between us (i'm a data hoarder. I keep everything.) The only time she was uncomfortable was when I came on her, and she said that was because she had never done it before. I thought thats all it was, and like I always do, asked her twice, thrice, and four times if whatever we did was okay. She just said she was nervous. Every time we did anything, I asked several, several times if things were okay. Every time she said yes. \n I regretted acting the way I did, because I knew I had not treated her as well as I could of and that we both got swept up in physicality. Ive always regretted it. But during the time, I was sweet and nice and everything I am in every relationship Ive had. I apologized profusely many many times after we broke up, and for a long time whenever we talked, I would apologize about it. She was a rebound, I know that, and I was sorry for treating her like one. \n Fast forward to now. I randomly checked her facebook (she unfriended me about two years ago) and I see that shes written up our entire relationship as if I raped her, saying things like ""he didnt care if I cried or said no, sometimes he would force me to do things"" and posted some quotes from me (edited and taken very much out of context) that make it seem as if I was a muscle headed guy who raped her and laughed while she cried. It couldnt be farther from the truth. \n Its on her main page. Over 100 people have liked it. Shes posted it on a board about helping sexual abuse victims. We have mutual friends. There is enough information for people to know it was me. Please help. I dont know what to do. I'm not afraid of being prosecuted (like I say, I have all our chats, so I can prove she wanted to do the sexual things we did) but I am afraid she will continue to tell everyone I raped her. My family would find out too. Please help."	Went too fast physically with a rebound. She now says I raped her.	578	13	relationship_advice
First post ever so if I am doing this wrong I apologize. \n We met our first year of college and fell in love. Things were great for the first few months, but then things slowly start to head downhill from there. She stopped caring for school and stopped going to class. Fast forward to a year into our relationship and she gets kicked out which means she can no longer stay on campus. So what do we do? We move in together, she gets a job at a local restaurant making minimum wage. \n That was two years ago, since then she has lost all ambition and destroyed her credit. She has done nothing with her life and is dependent on me for everything. She has a medical condition which costs quite a bit and no health insurance. I haven't felt anything but disdain for her for the last two years. Although I feel I can't leave her since she has no friends, no money, a bad family situation and would not be able to survive without my help.

I've been together with a girl for seven months. We have a ton if stuff in common, enjoyed each other's company a lot, have similar interests and senses of humor. Both went to HS together, have similar friends, etc. I think the world of this girl, and as cliche as it sounds, am having trouble believing I'll find someone I'll ever be as interested in. \n We started our relationship taking it slow, spending a lot of quality time together, hanging out, taking day trips, and both had wonderful times. We started getting intimate after a few months, and were one another's firsts. We kept that up for a few months. I got a job at her work where we don't necessarily see a lot of eachother, but the pay is pretty good, so I'd like to stay. \n My girlfriend and one of her friends went to another country for a month. We talked to one another, and had a lot of plans when we came back, and  she just came home. I noticed something was a little funny when she came home and started hanging out with her friends, and didn't seem too interested and hanging out with me. We just went on an overnight trip to see a concert (I had bought tickets to a faraway show for her birthday some months ago). \n While we were there, I asked her why she didn't seem too interested in me, and we had a long conversation. She told me that she didn't think she could really love me, and didn't want to be together any more. Allegedly it's not my fault and she still really cares for me. I told her that I still obviously have a lot of deep feelings for her, and told her that I loved her before she left (and she said she was close but not quite at the same level). I've done everything I could to be attentive, compassionate, and sensitive to what she wants the whole time we've been together. \n We will still work together and probably see each other since we have mutual friends. We're also still playing in a couple music groups together, and are planning a trip (to which we've already bought tickets) with a couple other friends for a week long road trip to a music festival. \n I'm really interested in keeping up this relationship, and really love this girl, and have felt the whole 7 months, until just now, that it was what she wanted and that she felt almost the same way about me. Should I try and talk to her more, and see if she's interested and willing to develop deeper feelings? I'd absolutely like to stay with this girl, and would do a lot to continue our relationship.

We started talking the day of again that night, but she still wants to talk to me and doesn't want to lose me.  She states she needs time and doesn't know how long it will be but just needs a friend right now and too take time.  I graduate in May and I believe that may be the time she is aiming for because that will take the long distance strain from us when I move back home.  I know that may not be that long but just this week is killing me. \n To add more we talk as if we are still together; love you, babe, gorgeous etc.  Also she really likes to talk about our future and things we want to do together.  Also I brought up a movie that comes out next month she wants to see and said she would see it with me.  Then other times she gets upset and states that I am pushing her and not giving her the time she needs.  She does not like too hear serious talk and says she wants a friend to talk to, but on the other hand we talk about things that friends wouldn't talk about.   Its just hard for me to talk this way and her say she misses me and then not want to. \n I stupidly asked if I could come see her today and she got upset again saying I was pushing so fast, but its hard not to think its ok by the way we talk. \n Also I know she hasn't found someone else or trying to find someone else, I trust her on that and I know how she is.  I would just really know if someone could give me a inside look of what may be going on and what time of time frame she is looking at. \n PLEASE ADVISE	Girlfriend broke things off, still wants to talk a lot but doesn't want to get back together right now.

Before I go any further, I know about the age difference, I get that its a big gap, but that is not what I care about. I knew a man from when I was 18 to 20, we were just friends and he was honestly one of the most wonderful people I have met in my life. It did not start that way, I thought he was a bit of a snob, but as we kept talking I found I have never been able to relate with anyone like him. When I was 20 I moved and went off to college, but before leaving I gave him a letter and asked him to stay in touch. \n Since then, we chat online from time to time and we met once over the summer, but I have never just outright told him how I felt because 1) I have never heard of that working 2) I don't want to risk loosing him in my life. I have tried dating other men, and guys my age, but I have not felt the same about anyone besides him. \n It has been about a year since I have seen him in person, and I have honestly been trying to move on, but I can't stop thinking about him and thinking about how many things I want to talked to him about, share with him, and experience with him again. Part of me wants to try and move on still, but another wants to just rush off and confess that I am in love with him. \n One thing is clear, I never want to be without some part of him in my life, but I don't know how much I really am willing to have. So what is it then? Should I keep trying to find someone else or confess how I feel to him somehow? Confessing opens up a whole new can of problems of how to go about it and I find it so difficult to keep trying to get over it when it has been a year and I still feel the same way about him. \n p.s: he is not married, he is not gay, he is single and has a stable income. just clearing that up before it comes up as possible problems. \n p.s.s: I am in college, graduating in a year, summa cum laude, and single.

So bare with me as I get through all of this.\nSome background first: my girlfriend and I have been dating for just over a year and a half. We met freshman year of college and we're best friends for a while before eventually dating (about half of the time I've known her I've dated her). I'd say just as a general guess since we've been dating about 70-80% of the time things are great, and we're not having any major issues. \n There's one major issue I'm struggling with though. My girlfriend has severe anxiety. She had some personal issues when she was younger and definitely has depressive tendencies as well, but the over arching issue is the anxiety. \n Now in all honesty, I really have no issue with being there for her, walking her through or just being a listening ear, trying to deal with her as best I can when she has panic attacks, and so on, but as of late I've been noticing more that during her panic attacks she'll eventually start taking shit out on me. This has probably been going on for a while but the honeymoon phase or whatever has clouded my ability to notice or really care/have it affect me. Yesterday, she had a panic attack and basically blamed every issue that caused it on me when in reality I had no control over causing her to feel as she did nor knowing that certain things were bothering - because she wasn't telling me that they were bothering her until during the panic attack and then she was saying it in a way that was some shit I don't want to hear when I'm already trying to deal with the other stuff she's saying mid-panic attack. \n I went and spoke to her last night and basically told her that I am 100% willing and there to help with panic attacks and I have no issue with that, but that I can't deal with her attacking me personally for things that weren't my fault. She took this extremely poorly and told me to fuck off and go home basically. \n I tried to explain to her that I was just being honest about how I felt and she basically wasn't having it so I decided it'd be best for me to go and give us both time to cool down. As I was driving home she texted me a bunch of shit about how much of a dick I was and all this shit and so I basically told her I didn't want to talk anymore and stopped responding. \n Then she started calling me and I'd answer and she'd just be crying and I couldn't deal with her having some pity sob story when I felt like shit and honestly feel like I can't feel certain ways because of her anxiety. The remainder of the night was her calling and me telling her I couldn't talk back and forth until she finally calmed down. \n We then we're talking a little more calmly and I said something and shit got crazy pissed and hung up on me. I basically texted her after that apologizing for whatever I said but just left it at that and went to bed. \n So anyways, I'm not sure if I'm being overly sensitive or if there's a better way for me to deal with her (and her anxiety), but I also am tired of trying to express issues I have with how she treats me and it resulting in her getting mad at how I present the issue or just her thinking she doesn't do anything wrong.	my girlfriend ha a awful anxiety, I'm not sure if the relationship is toxic but I want to help her through her anxiety but not if it's going to instantly result in me being mentally beat up for shit that bothers her but she won't tell me about \n Just need general thoughts, suggestions, etc. if you have any additional questions feel free. \n Apologies for the length.	606	66	relationship_advice
Background: I haven't ever had a girlfriend, and people tell me I'm socially awkward, so I don't really have a clue what I'm doing and I'd like to not come off as a creeper or something weird. \n We're both juniors in high school and I have some feelings for her. Problem is that I only see her in the halls. I, being the school genius that I am, am not in any classes with her but one huge class, which she sits on the other side of the room so I can't talk to her then. I only see her in the hallway about 2-3 times a day and occasionally I pass her at lunch. \n I don't believe she has any feelings for me but I'd like to change that, plus I'm sorta afraid other guys will try to get to her first. Is there anyway I can get her to notice me above the rest of the crowd? \n Also are there any small signs or gestures I can do when I pass her in the hall to show her I'm interested? I wan't to go up and talk to her, but what exactly should I say? She knows I exist but just sees me as another kid in the school I'm afraid. What can I do/say to change this?

Me 23/f him 27/m \n We dated for 8 months. It got serious very quickly but we both had issues. I was insecure, and scared of being abandoned (I had just moved to the country and didn't know anyone, we were friends from home) and I wasn't good at acknowledging his feelings because his insecurities tied inversely to mine. \n He was terrified of being trapped, wasnt looking for something serious and was markedly oblivious, and was hiding things from me. He doesn't believe that lying by omission is still lying. \n We broke up and it was pretty horrible, both of us coming through it fairly damaged. \n Due to circumstances out of our control, we have to see each other every day, all day. There is little to nothing we can do about it. \n It's been another 8 months and he's insisted we need to see other people whilst we rebuild our trust and relationship, which has to happen before we date again.

She's not your problem. She's an adult, and she can take care of herself.  Do not be guilted or feel obligated.  She'll survive just fine without you, even if it's more inconvenient for a while.  She has friends and family to help her out. if she doesn't, it's her own damn fault, and she'll learn her lesson for next time.	"I give you permission to completely abandon her without guilt. \n P.S. Have we all also learned yet that ""on again - off again"" should always remain off permanently?

Hello Reddit, I am a 15M, and I am dating a girl who is also 15. We have had a nice relationship so far, and have been dating since the first month of freshman year, and now into sophomore year. \n BACKGROUND \nOur relationship has been a very close one, we're best friends and love each other dearly. We've had many problems in the past about her with other guys and never anything with me. I see her every day at school and usually every weekend and when we were not together we texted constantly. Over time she became very suffocating and jealous, to the point where I  couldn't even talk to girls  without creating any sort of problem. During the summer months (June 6 - August 15) We have off from school and we saw each other almost  every day  and I think that only amplified the connection we have for each other but also her jealousy. Towards the end of those months and I grew apart from her because it got old doing the same thing every day with each other and her family. We love one another very much and have a strong connection but I feel like my time is being put to waste as my life revolves around the relationship and not focusing on the happiness of myself. \n The Breakup \nOver time the unhappiness got to me and I could bare the feeling anymore, so I ended it. Things felt lonely but I feel like I couldn't let go of what we had as it was very special, and we've done many things together (Disney World etc). I only made it worse by looking at old notes and such to amplify how I felt. Also, I live in a small town so I'd see her around school frequently and that did not help my situation of moving on and finding happiness. Over time I wanted her back and went through the process of doing so. \n Quick Background of my daily life \nI am one of those kids without a dad and my mom is rarely home due to being a single parent and it gets lonely at times seeing as I had no one to talk to, and previously the person who I texted  all  day long was gone from my life leaving a void. \n Post-Getting back together \nI was very happy at first as I had someone who was there to talk to again and be there with me and it felt nice to be with someone who I loved. Two months later I feel like the same process is happening over again. I love her very much and I promised I wouldn't do what I did before to her again. I am her complete  world  right now. \n Did I make the right decision? Did I do it out of loneliness?	Broke up with jealous girlfriend and got back together with her, but she is doing the same thing again but I love her.	476	23	relationship_advice
"SORRY FOR THE LONG POST, BUT THIS IS A LONG STORY. \n So I may or may not have done something super shitty and led a guy on. And now I don't know what to do. I have very conflicted feelings about all this. \n First of all, me and this guy are good friends. We haven't really known each other for that long, but we get along pretty well. That's the first thing. \n One day, he asked me to watch [insert tv show] with him. I said yes. I passively let him give me my first kiss. He never asked me out or made it clear that he was actually interested in me apart from that. I'm pretty sure we're still not in a relationship. \n Following weeks, he pushes me to take off my clothes, touches me, kisses me, etc, and then eventually gets me to give him a blowjob. Freaks me the fuck out. Not into it. I'm very passive and easy to coerce. I don't like to disappoint people and I really dislike confrontation. I essentially want to please everyone and make everyone happy, and it's kind of a terrible personality trait. I said ""no, I don't want to"" once, and then when he insisted, I did it.\nThing is, I'm relatively sure I'm asexual, and I derive little to no pleasure from any of this sort of thing. Kissing is ok, but this is really not. At the same time, I'm not sure if I'm actually asexual or if it's inexperience, or if it's him. \n This is last week. For a week, I haven't spoken to him. He's made repeated attempts to spend time with me, and I've brushed him off or rejected him every time with some excuse or other. He has my number and he only texts me sporadically. \n Today, I saw him and my roommate basically dragged me away, but he said he ""needs to talk"" and that it's ""serious"". I don't know what to do now. I'm not into him sexually. Or really romantically. He just seemed lonely, and his friend said his last relationship ended badly and I didn't want to make him feel bad. He's relatively nice, I guess, but I don't know how far he's going to push me, etc. \n I know I'm being a shitty person. I hate commitment. I don't know what to do. I think I led him on out of some sort of weird mix of pity and need to please everyone. I feel really bad. I'm scared about what he wants to talk to me about. Help."	Moved too fast with a guy I'm not really into, may have led him on, avoided him for a week, and now he wants to talk to me seriously and I'm kind of really badly freaking out.	431	37	relationship_advice
"So.. me and this guy have been ""talking"" for the past 10 months or so. We met online, and eventually, irl. We went on a lot of dates and things were going pretty amazing! \n But lately he's changed. He got distant. Keep in mind we talked almost everyday for the past 9 or so months. So it was upsetting to me. He wasn't like this. He was caring and sweet. It's what made me like him. \n Later on we had a fight  where he said he never even considered us ""dating"" and that I was pressuring him into this. I wasn't. He was happy to see me and we both were kinda head over heels for each other. He wanted me as much as I wanted him, maybe even more. \n In the end we both kinda said we'd wait and see if we're accepted into the same colleges, as apparently that's the only thing keeping him back.. \n He's been an ass to me though. He never texts me first anymore. He almost never suggests plans. And now he just stopped replying to my texts. \n I'm not the kinda person to send 5000 messages when he doesn't reply. It's just in the middle of our conversation, he reads one message and never replies. And he's still online. It's rude.. Or am I overreacting? \n This has happened so many times now. And he's generally cold and distant, and it's breaking my heart. I try to be like old times, or crack a joke or try to flirt but he just reads and doesn't reply.\nHe said he likes me, and that he's just ""independent"". But I don't know if I should keep trying anymore."	"Guy I've been ""seeing"" is suddenly icy and distant but says he still wants us to workout.."	282	17	relationship_advice
"So, we've been a couple for a little under a year and a half. We met in college and were close friends for a long time before becoming romantically involved. About two months into the relationship, she had to leave school for financial reasons and we've been long distance ever since. \n First she was working for awhile, but then repressed traumatic memories started to resurface that caused her to be unable to work and now she has been forced to move back in with her parents while receiving treatment and trying to go back to school to finish her degree. Her diagnosis is PTSD from a previous abusive relationship. Her family is not supportive and her mother in particular behaves in a way that majorly triggers her symptoms. She also does not have much in the way of a local social network as her parents do not live in the area she grew up, so most of her emotional support comes from me and some other long-distance friends. She has told me repeatedly that she would ""have nothing without [me]."" \n I, meanwhile, have been living in my ideal city for almost a year now after graduating last spring. I'm in the arts, so it's slow going and I have to work a soul-sucking day job, but all and all I'm in a good place, though still very much in the process of building my life. I've met some really cool people and started making friendships within my field. I've also started to meet a lot of other women, which is where the problem starts to come in. Just to be clear, I haven't done anything, but I've definitely developed something of a wandering eye. \n I've said to friends multiple times that if my relationship was just long distance or if she was local but still going through these issues, I would probably be able to cope more easily. However, neither of these things seem likely to go away any time soon. Her mental illness is a chronic condition where the goal is control rather than cure. I've accepted this, the problem is that I don't feel like I'm emotionally stable enough as a person to be the only thing in another person's life that keeps them some semblance of sane. I genuinely fear for what would happen to her mental state if I were to break up with her and I don't want anything dire to happen. Regardless of my feelings about our relationship, I'll always care very deeply about her as a person as our relationship was close for a long while before we added the romantic component. There's also the fact that the only viable option right now for her, school-wise, is to stay where she is as the community college there will likely allow her to transfer to the state university with a major scholarship after a semester or two so that she can finish her degree. She starts summer classes there in a few weeks. So it's not looking like the distance will be able to close for a very long time. \n I'm starting to ramble now, so I'm going to just leave it there as I think that's all of the relevant information. What should I do? Is there any point in trying to make it work? How? Is there any way to break up without making her condition worse?"

My ex of 3+ years and I broke up about a month ago. Due to a number of reasons (she's just graduating from college at 25, she's suffered depression her whole life and wants to get healthy), she basically didn't want to continue being in such a serious relationship. I think that she feels very young, and that she has a lot of growing up and healing to do that requires her to be on her own. Of course I know this includes dating other people, but she's also never lived on her own and wants to do that before she gets engaged/married/etc. \n The complicated thing is that we both love each other very much. Up to the day we broke up, she talked about how much she loved me and about our future together. Even as we were breaking up, she told me that she thought there was a possibility that we might end up together at some point in the future. As a result, she wants to stay friends. \n I'm open to the possibility that we might end up together at some point, but right now I really just want to move on with my life. I'm looking at it as an opportunity to get to know myself better, and figure out the type of person that I want to be going forward (I'm 26). \n My question is, do you think it's worth it to stay friends, or should I go the no-contact route until I feel like I've gotten over her? I don't want to throw away the possibility of a future for the two of us, but I also don't want to string myself along and prolong the misery.	Girlfriend of 3 years and I broke up. She wants to stay friends because she thinks that we might have a future together at some point. Is she being unreasonable?	283	30	relationship_advice
I've never had this before with her. I would always hang with her since I was always free (jobless). My days were pretty much spent on her, well in a larger scale you can say the past 2 years were largely spent on her. Of course I've seen my friends, but 90% of those 2 years were her, which at the time I didn't mind. Also I didn't make new friends in college so those friends I just said I see are high school friends. Now I got a job back in June, so of course there's new people to talk to and such else. I don't know if this helps my question but most of co-workers are women, MOST not all. So ever since this job I've been wanting to be with her less and on a daily basis she would annoy me, the simple things she does. I don't know if this is just a dumb phase or what. If anything else you need to ask let me know, i'll answer.	Been with this girl for 2 years and most of those 2 year have been spent on her.

background: \n i've been living in SF for about a year and a half with my boyfriend of about 1 year. Other than my bf and coworkers, my family is from Los Angeles. \nWe met at work and are used to spending all day together (from carpooling, working, and after work). \n He's very shy and quiet, not the brightest crayon in the box but still very smart in his own way. Think of him like street smart instead of book smarts. He is very level headed and introverted. \n He recently got a new job and works the night shift (6pm - 6am) and I just got a new job as well (9am - 6pm). We hardly ever see each other and for the past two months, his only day off is on sunday. Due to his schedule though, he sleeps all day and is only able to spend time with me for about 4 hours on sundays. I've been feeling a lack of affection from him but honestly its due to him being tired from working so much. I hate complaining to him because there's nothing he can do to change his schedule and I end up feeling like I'm nagging him. \n Recently I've been feeling very homesick and have cried to him multiple times that i want to visit my family. Usually we go once a month down to LA and that subdues the homesickness for awhile. \n Yesterday though, I told him I was not happy being away from my family and I'm almost always alone up in our apartment since his work hours are opposite of mine. We had a short conversation where he told me that he was not holding me back and i could leave if i wanted to. He wasn't too responsive when I mentioned being in a long distance relationship (He doesn't like it because we both have needs that can't be fulfilled if we are apart). \n So last night i made the decision to move back home. He helped me pack (although completely silent) and this morning i drove down. Now he wont text me back or answer my calls. So now I'm left unsure of where our relationship stands or whether or not he still wants to be with me. \n Reddit, what should i do? how should i go about getting him to talk? In a sense I am just asking for advice on how to get the conversation started and how to go about this situation without hurting his feelings or doing anything irrational. I'm just so lost and don't know how to approach the situation. I mean I'm happy at home but I'm also happy with him (whenever hes spending time with me). Is it worth losing him to be with my friends and family or is it worth losing my friends and family to be with him?

"I don't feel like getting into details, so I'll just list everything that went wrong. We would talk every single day and were really close for the 2-3 months we knew each other. We found common ground on a lot of things despite our age difference and got along really well. \n \n On our drive up to some town, she told me to not tell anyone that we are friends and that it was just a rideshare. I just agreed to it to avoid conflict in the car and to minimize my chances of getting stranded in the highway late at night. \n \n Forgot to pay for gas but offered to reimburse her the next day for the entire trip. She declined the offer and said that if I really wanted to pitch in for gas, I should've done it during the trip. \n \n When we arrived to our accommodation, we had separate rooms and agreed to go in separately. After checking in, I was really tired after a long day and got impatient of waiting for her to return from the washroom, so in my tired mindset, I just got my stuff from the car and went to my room, which resulted in me practically abandoning her in a parking lot and subsequently failing to make sure she got to her door safely and help her with her luggage. \n \n The next day, she ranted to me about number 2 and 3 through facebook. I told her that I feel bad about what I did and offered to make things up to her, starting with reimbursing her for the entire trips worth of gas. She told me she doesn't believe in making thing up and that it's the principle that counts and if I really wanted to pitch in, I would've offered. I honestly forgot to do so, so in my mind, offering to reimburse for the entire trip was the best thing I could think of. She told me to keep the money and that she just wants to be left alone. Hasn't messaged me since. Last message I sent to her was telling her ""It sucks how I destroyed a beautiful 2-3 month friendship we had in one day. I seriously miss talking to you everyday and I'm sure part of you feels the same way."".

So I was on a very long bike ride during vacation and stopped at a poke stop to catch some Pokemon and be the very best, like no one was ever was. This poke stop happened to be a beautiful and semi secluded lake next to a park with a wonderful young woman drawing. As I caught some Pokemon, I said hello, trying to mind my own business. But our casual conversation blossomed into a very nice experience and we ended up talking for over an hour. I was invited for a car ride (I'm super happy here), so I hide my bike in some bushes and get a tour from my new friend.

"Okay so here is the backstory, we met 2 years ago in class and really hit it off (ie, similar music, hobbies, etc) 2 weeks after dating I moved to North Dakota from Oregon with my family we would continue to date long distance and I would visit every month or so.

"I will try to keep this as short as possible, thank you! \n I was in a relationship with my SO for about 7 months after  being acquaintances for a few years. She told me she would be going to school for 2 years and warned me it might be an issue. I said it was no big deal and that we should try. So fast forward 7-8 months and the time has come for her to move, she initiates a break up at this time and says she wont have time to meet my needs. Fair enough. \n She comes back to me asking to get back together, I say lets give it a try and off she goes. 3 weeks into her school she tells me she likes it up there and might want to stay for another 4 years on top of the two. On top of that there would be no time because she was in a rigorous med program.

"Throwaway because she reddits. Hey all, here is the back story. Annie and I have been dating for four months after meeting at work.

We have since made sure that we do not work on the same project, but we often work in the same buildings.

I hemmed and haw'd about weather it was my anxiety about being away or if was truly an issue. She lost her phone while she was out on NYE and we began to Skype. Through the video chat I could see that something was amiss so I pressed. \n She said that she has a lot on her plate right now, which is true ( finding a new job, and a steady place to live, and where to do both of those things), and she feels that she is not giving the me the attention I deserve.

This is a throwaway account, but I'm very serious about this. My fiancee's family is Muslim and would like me to pretend to convert and have a Muslim wedding so that their family does not suffer repercussions from their culture. Most of my fiancee's extended family is in Pakistan and all of them are Muslim. If she marries me in a non-Muslim wedding, her family risks being essentially excommunicated, though that's unlikely. For certain, her younger sister's options for an arranged marriage will be limited. Her father and mother will be forced to at least pretend to disown her. She may never get to see her younger brother again and will very likely never get to visit her family in Pakistan. \n On the other hand, if I agree, I'm lying, not just about something small, but about what I supposedly hold most dear. (I'm not religious.) I will be required to do some things to prove my belief (give some money probably, read from the Quran, sign something, etc.) and will very likely have to meet quite a few people and lie many times at least partially convincingly. \n Afterwards, my fiancee believes that we can avoid having anything further to do with the religion. She isn't Muslim, but half-heartedly pretends to be when she has to. I'm not certain that we'll be able to avoid further lies, especially if I have contact with her family in Pakistan in the future. \n What I am looking for is reasons for and against. I think lying is wrong, but I know that there are some times where something wrong is the lesser of evils. I don't want my fiancee and her whole family to suffer because I'm a stickler for morals. I would love for there to be a creative way for everyone to be happy, so any suggestions along those lines would be wonderful. I have met with the Imam and spoken with a couple who are friends with the family and I haven't found a compromise. I'm willing to work towards any honest solution. (I could explain my attempts further in the comments or an edit if people are curious.) \n My fiancee and I would both very much appreciate your views. Thank you.

"Condensed Version Background: I grew up in a VERY conservative and religious environment, it seemed like the whole town went to one of the 5 churches in our city.  I'm sort of recovering from that environment. \n I have about 3 married friends who are in a similar boat, but they still nominally identify with evangelical christianity and are sorta kinda pretending they buy it a lot more than they really do...because they are married with kids which set them on a certain course.

What is the balance between needing personal freedom and having a healthy level of accountability? \n Example: I am a legal marijuana patient and can therefore grow my own, which could potentially save me some money with very little time invested.  She has no problem with smoking, but yesterday I got a scowl and slightly mom-ish ""Why do you  need  to grow it so bad anyways?  You're obsessed."" \n I stopped her right there and said that bc of 'all the church stuff' what she had just said made me feel defensive.  She poutily apologized and I said it was more a ""me thing"" than a her thing...that what she said was probably fine but my reaction inside was potentially disproportionate.  I'm not sure about that though."	If I am hypersensitive to what feels like criticism or judgement, do I work on that so I can eventually be compatible with someone someday?  Or am I just acknowledging a justifiable and healthy emotional need that should be a consideration in finding a marriagable partner?	338	46	relationship_advice
"dating this girl for four months now, and she told me from the start she has commitment issues, her mother has even mentioned it.  Due to certain circumstances, we see each other EVERYDAY, even if its just for 15-20 minutes(she lost her license, I help her get around). She has said it, she has commitment issues and said it as ""I'm like a wild mustang, I like to be running free"". She said shes getting used to it though. And the fact I'm so nice, she said no one has ever treated her so nice, and shes trying to get used to it. Some days it seems like shes trying to push me away, and others not. She said she loves me, and hates it when she feels like shes trying to push me away. This week its been all push away.

About 6 months ago I got to know this girl in one of my summer school classes and I got to know her fairly well. We chatted a fair bit via IM and eventually I decided to bite the bullet and ask her out (at that point in time she was the first girl I had asked out). She informed me that she was already seeing someone, so I stopped communicating with her via IM. However, later in the year we still shared classes and our friendship restored to a fairly normal equilibrium (she was really good about things afterwards). \n Fast forward a few months and she has gone overseas on exchange to study. I have been enjoying my life so far and I have tried my best to get over what happened and spend time with other girls (although I am still single). However, around my birthday she contacts me via IM to wish me happy birthday and we start up a bit of a conversation again which has been regularly running for a while. Now I as much as I hate to admit it, some of my old feelings for her are starting to seep back in and I really want to put the matter to rest in my own mind. What do I do and how can I stop my irrational feelings? Thanks so much, the community has been very helpful so far.	Can't get a girl, who has rejected me in the past but has started communicating again, out of mind.	236	19	relationship_advice
So I just started dating this guy and I really like him and care about him a lot. He dotes on me and really just romances me basically. Treats me as his equal and is so kind to me. We connect very deeply. I feel like a better person for being with him. I really do. However, though we've cuddled and held hands we haven't yet kissed or done anything else. We're both in our 20s. We basically just made it official yesterday but we've been going out for a couple of weeks and before that had been emailing each other for months. I've kissed people in the past but I haven't gone beyond that mostly because I've had a lot of abusive experiences throughout my life and opening up to even the intimacy of kissing takes a long time for me. He told me that I'm a beautiful person and as long as I know that he doesn't care much about intimacy or expressing those feelings physically and that I should never feel pressured to do so. Calling me a beautiful person probably means he thinks I'm beautiful on the outside too right? I hate to be insecure about this but he's really the antithesis of vain and shallow so I just don't want to find out one day that he never really found me attractive in the first place. It would sting a bit. Even though I appreciate what a deep person he is. That's why I think he's so wonderful. After we got done cuddling he did call me beautiful, though. I guess I should just believe him.\nEdit: It's also hard because though I do think I'm cute, he's (in my view) extremely attractive. One of the most handsome guys I've ever seen. So I guess I just feel like he's a little out of my league.	Is he just a really good guy?	311	7	relationship_advice
"I am a sixteen year old Indian girl and I have been with my boyfriend for almost a year now.  This isn't like those typical ""I kept my relationship hidden and now I'm screwed"".  In the beginning, I asked my parents permission to date him and they met him and his parents and said yes.  They had some restrictions which included no physical stuff whatsoever.  Well as the relationship progressed naturally we began doing things.  We did everything except sex.  One day my mom took my phone and read my texts and found texts of us talking about what we had done and such. And this was on Valentine's day with out six month anniversary and his 18th birthday happening in the same week.  I was basically not allowed to see him at all outside of school till about a week or two ago.  We used to stay after school together just so we could spend some  time with each other but it was still really hard and his name brought so much tension in my house.  Finally last weekend my parents let him come over to my house to hang out where we were never left alone and where we were almost constantly watched over.  I haven't had proper alone time with him for over 3 months.  And it's really affecting our relationship.  He feels like absolute crap cause he feels like my parents don't trust him.  Which to a sense they don't, but it's more that they don't trust us together.  My mom is nice to him and is a little more accepting but my dad hates him.  Every conversation about my boyfriend I have to hear my dad insulting him.  The thing is this doesn't just stop there I am restricted socially too.  I can barely hang out with my friends and I often feel kind of left out.  It's like my parents don't let me just be a teenager.  For my junior prom, I had to reason with them for almost a month to let me go with my boyfriend and just to normal prom, we weren't allowed to go to post-prom either.  I wasn't allowed to go to his senior prom either.  I have tried talking to my parents about how strict they are but it all boils down to ""study study, you have time for all this later, this is now the time you need to get your priorities straight"".  It's so frustrating for me because I understand that they have good intentions and I know what they are trying to do, but they are restricting me too much.  I have these two sides inside me that are at a constant struggle, I want to listen to them but at the same time I want to be me and make my decisions without them making them for me.  I really want to make it work between me and my boyfriend though, and both of us love each other very very much.  That's the reason we are still together now even through all the confusion.  But it's getting really hard especially since he is not in school anymore (seniors leave early) and I barely get to see him and I can't really talk on the phone without my parents getting mad at me.  At this point I really just don't know what to do or how to deal with it."	My parents are super strict and it's making my reltionship hard	565	11	relationship_advice

Hello there, so it's my first post in here and I have a truly unfortunate situation and I would like to hear some thoughs and advice from you. \n I have a truly caring perfect 11/10 boyfriend who I love a lot. We have been friends since forever and some short time ago we started a romantic relationship. I know it's silly, but I have been already dreaming about our future together. He is one of the most important people in my life; couldn't survive without him since the boy is my best friend. \n Aaand there's another man. A lovely, smart, witty and honest man. I fell in love with him at a very young (I was 12) age, sadly, he rejected me because he's older and stuff. Was trying to reach him for five years, time after time tried to tell him about my feelings, but we just stayed friends because he had a very jealous girlfriend and so on. Recently I have grown up and some time ago he got dumped by his gf because she was cheating on him, I think, because she already has another guy. And a few days ago I got a message from him. We chatted all day long about silly stuff and it felt like anything wrong never happened between us. He invited me for coffee, some time soon we are going to meet up. My bf is not against it. \n And the saddest part I can't stop thinking about the other man I loved since I was so little. At the same time, I couldn't live without my precious boyfriend. \n Any thoughts? \nThank you.	In love with two men. 11/10 both of them. Help.	272	10	relationship_advice
"So, I've become good friends with my boyfriend over the past year, and we've been dating for about 5 months. He mentioned this girl he practically fell in love with, but never dated, maybe once or twice casually long before we were dating, so I never thought it to be that big of a deal. Basically, from what he's told me, he really liked her, ""began to fall in love,"" and went through hell and high water to get him to like her. However, she rejected him and was a complete bitch to him afterward. He said she also told a bunch of people that he was a total creeper. This was about a year to a year and a half ago. But really, he talked maybe 5 minutes on that subject total. I figured he was okay now. \n However, after we started dating, he began to make it clear that he was extremely angry with her. He referred to her as subhuman, and would always act extremely pissed off whenever he'd see her. He's friends with this guy who used to date her, and when she showed up one night when we were all hanging out, he said that just her presence killed the night. Whenever he'd her, he'd literally run away. He'd even talk about how he dreaded going to school or other events because of her being there. Really, she doesn't do anything now. She's pretty much forgotten his existence, but he still acts as though she's trying to ruin his life. \n I've told him I think he REALLY needs to get over her, and that I don't want to hear him complaining about her because nobody wants to hear about their significant other bitch about a relatively harmless ex-crush, right? Anyways, he always will be like ""okay, alright, alright,"" yet he STILL continues to do it. Is it even worth bothering about? Am I being selfish/unempathetic, or is this an actual problem?

Hey, \n So for the last 6 months I have found myself just not able to give all to my marriage anymore. I have been married for about three years to a girl I have known for seven. At the start things were great, we were very close completely committed to each other. But something changed along the way and I just don't know what. \n We no longer have a sexual relationship of any kind which is one of my main frustrations as it used to be incredibly active. Apparently she no longer finds me physically attractive and it just doesn't do anything for her. \n She constantly puts me down, referring to my weight and often makes my already low self esteem seem completely vanish. She also does very little for herself. I literally feel like my role within this relationship is to serve her. \n We argue a lot, which isn't that big of a deal, but it's over stupid stuff. If I go out with friends after work I know I will be in for a lot of trouble when I return. To the point now where I am banned from doing it. I don't drink often, if at all and usually back home no later than 10:30pm but that is still apparently unreasonable on the rare (less than once a month) occasions I do it. \n I am painting a one sided picture here, she is a very loving and caring person and I don't think she sees any of this as being hurtful or controlling. She suffers with depression so it's often a roller coaster ride to top it off. She also doesn't want kids and I think that is causing me more and more concern as we go in. \n So yeah, I don't know how to deal with this. I have tried talking to her about it all but she is amazing at playing the victim. I am terrible at walking away or giving up on anything. Just don't know what to do. \n Anyway,	I married the love of my life, I am not in a good place with it now and I don't know how to deal with it.	336	26	relationship_advice
"Apologies for how long this will be.\nBasically it all started with a girl (who I will refer to as B) my friend (who I will refer to as G) introduced me to about 9 months ago.\nG introduced me to B with the intention of setting us up. I was interested in another girl I had met at that point so I didn't pursue B. \n Time went on and I didn't see B again until about a month ago. At this point things between me and the other girl has run their course and we both agreed we were not very compatible. I seen B at a house party she hosted but 2 weeks prior to this G and B had sex, just a casual fling. I even asked G if he planned on pursuing anything further with B and he said no it was just sex, nothing more. \n At the party myself and B got on great, lots of flirting etc. We exchanged numbers and started texting infrequently. When this started I planned to ask B if she wanted to grab a drink sometime but before I done this i approached G and asked him how he would feel about me asking her out for a drink. G replied ""Do what you want man, doesn't affect me. It was just a casual thing."" \n Great. So I ask her out, she says she's low on cash but offers to come down to my house for dinner and a movie. B and myself both knew this wasn't going to move any further than some casual fun, neither of us are currently looking for a relationship. \n The day before she is due to come down to my house, which was 3 days ago G asks me what I am doing the next day.

In a situation like that a straight answer is what anybody would be looking for. Could it be jealousy on his part? At the party B showed a lot more interest in me and brushed off his advances. \n At this point I am thinking he must have feelings for her but he told me that isn't the case and that I have ruined his chance at a potential ""fuckbuddy."" \n At this point I thought this isn't worth ruining a friendship over so I made up some paperthin excuse at the last minute to get out of B coming to my house. \n In your honest opinion is G over-reacting? or was I sneaky and betrayed his trust?"

I know everyone's situations are different, and require the move in to happen sooner rather than having the option, but if you have the option would you?

I guess problems is not really the best word to use because we actually get along really well and I love them dearly, but I can't think of a better word. My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 and a half years and go to college together about an hour away from home. We have a great relationship, and I can easily see myself marrying him years down the line when the time is right. One of my favorite things about him is how much he values his family. I really wouldn't change this for the world. \n The problem is that his culture as far as family (he's hispanic and I am caucasian) is really different. They are literally together all the time! His parents separated when he was younger and his mother is very attached to him and sort of seems to see him as a replacement for a relationship as far as emotional attachment goes. We only see each other alone and not with his family when we are away at school except on occasion because he is expected by his mother and sister to be almost always at home if they are there. Basically, when they are at work or busy we can hang out but when they get home, they expect him to be there. He tells me that it is a cultural thing but I just find it to be a bit odd when it is every single day and especially considering he is 20 years old, not a young kid living under his mother's roof. I have been really understanding about this and tried to work around his families expectations for the last two and a half years but it gets really tiring having to constantly plan around them. Also, when I am around his family he treats me really differently. He has admitted to me that he has an irrational fear that his family will resent me if he starts acting differently because of me and his reaction to this is to basically ignore me around them and act as if I'm not there at times. We have talked about these problems several times and he admits he needs to be more considerate of my feelings but I always end up feeling guilty as if I am tearing him away from his family (which is the last thing I want!) and nothing has really changed. I sort of feel like he should start standing up to them a little more and very gently and kindly help them understand that he is not a little boy anymore and he has his own life. This has been an especially difficult problem in the last year because my mom has had severe health problems that will likely cause her to pass on at some point so I want to spend a lot of time with her at home and it would mean a lot to me if my SO would make the effort to come see me at home sometimes instead of me always having to see him. I want to know if I'm being selfish with this or I have a reason to be a bit upset that this doesn't change at all. I don't want him to lose any connection with his family, I just want them to allow him to start growing up and I fear this will only be a more serious problem years down the line when it is time to get married (if that time comes).	Am I selfish for wanting my boyfriend to gain independence from his very tight knit family?	588	16	relationship_advice

So a bit of backstory first: I'm homeschooled and take classes outside of high school, so I don't see people too often. I'm pretty shy, but I can talk to people normally and make friends pretty easily. I play in an outside of school band once a week with a lot of other people, but the problem is a lot of them know each other from school, so it's hard for me to talk to them. I talk to one or two people in the band, but not more than a few sentences. I noticed a few weeks back that a girl I'm interested in (heard her talking to others, looks nice, etc) keeps looking at me. This has been going on for a few weeks where she'll pass by my chair and glance at me, and try to look at me for a second when she's not playing. I want to at least talk to her, but I don't really have an opportunity because when we do have a break, she talks to people she already knows. Because I'm not a super brave guy, I can't really walk up to 2 people I've never talked to and join their conversation. Another problem is, I'm not too sure about the age difference. I know these people are from a high school, but she looks really young to me and I'm not sure what to do about that.	girl I haven't talked to keeps looking at me, knows other people and is already talking to them before I can talk to her. \n Any ideas on how I could talk to her, or at least get an opportunity to talk to her?

"This situation is extremely complicated. My girlfriend and I went to a party and she got WAY too drunk. I took her home, and cleaned her up, made sure she was safe, and watched over her while she hugged porcelain. She told me to go get her phone and text her mom (she is a student and lives with her parents) to let her know what was happening. I went and got her phone and opened the text message app, and noticed that her ex had been texting her. This is where I did something I shouldn't have. I know it was wrong, but I opened the conversation and scrolled up and saw a dick pic from her ex from about 6 days prior. Her response was ""when can you give that to me?"" and then ""when can you come over?"". I scrolled up to read more and there were texts asking when members of her family would be there, and above that, she was asking how much money he made a month, and then if he had had sex with anyone else. This is where I lost my cool a little (I know I shouldn't have done that) and stormed into the bathroom and yelled at her. She tried to explain everything but she was far too drunk to make any sense. I went home and the next day she called to explain that the reason he sent her pictures is because she had lent him $400 a while ago, and she needed it back to make her school payment for this month, but he wasn't paying it back and was blackmailing her with old photos he had of my girlfriend. The only way she could get him to come over and meet face-to-face was to say she was going to have sex with him, then her and her mom would confront him and demand the money back. NONE of this sat right with me at all. Later on, she had the ex-boyfriend call me and say nothing happened (which I thought was WILDLY inappropriate, given the situation) but he did say nothing had happened between them and that she loved me very much. I was standing firm, even though she was constantly calling me crying and saying she loves me and is sorry for what she did, and that nothing happened between them. I finally talked to her mom and she confirmed the story: the ex borrowed money and was not paying her back, and was blackmailing my girlfriend through old photos he had of her.

I recently had a (f)riend of mine over, with the entire house to myself and what I thought was an... Enticing circumstance. We are both in our first years of college, and the year before we had gotten fairly close... But nothing had ever come of it. \n So, I had mutually appreciated music playing, some plant matter to consume as we are wont to do, and a comfortable spot for things to get intimate, should they take that course. My question concerns events immediately after she arrived and the rest of the time we spent together. \n We hugged when I first opened the door, shared a little small talk on the way down the stairs, and then I went to the sink to get a glass of water. As far as I can tell, it was at this point about 30 seconds in when she stood the closest to me, looked at me right, and just generally seemed... Anticipatory. It came on so fast that I think this may have been the point I missed my chance. \n The rest of the afternoon went well, smoking, going through music, just sort of catching up. After about an hour I'd started to lose hope, but eventually the music got turned off entirely, and we were just sitting, facing each other, talking, and I started to twist my hair, just to do something with my hands... And she did the same, until I stopped, which she did too. As I understand, this is a fairly good indication of interest. I wanted to tell her how I had missed her and make my move, but... It just felt like the 'tone' was wrong. This too, may have been my mistake. I'm really not sure. \n My question is essentially did I blow it in the first minute because I was caught off guard, or did I miss an obvious opportunity later on because I psyched myself out?

Also, things are weird now because she promised me that we would try to sort things out when we got back to school in August which is two months away.

We went on a break in August and he started seeing other girls. It hurt at the time, even though techinically he was within his rights. It didn't stop me from bitching about it to my sisters. No one likes to see their ex moving on with other people. \n The biggest reason we took our break was because my family heavily pressured me into it. They don't approve of the fact the he stocks produce at a local grocery store. Honestly, neither does he. We both graduated from one of the top private universities in the state with relevant degrees and great prospects. I moved ahead with a promising career. He is 25 and still hasn't gotten anywhere. I know the economy is tough but it was getting ridiculous. \n My family is New York, Italian, Catholic, rich, and really intense. My oldest sister is a litigator at the top law firm in the city. My other sister married a surgeon. My mom was raised in the south Bronx and worked her ass off to get herself out of poverty and into a very luxurious lifestyle. She has no patience for laziness. She told me recently it makes no difference whether I have chemistry with the person I marry. As long as he's hard working, sucessful and can provide for me. That's when I decided to stop taking her advise on love and relationships. \n During our break my sisters tried to set me up with some of their more sucessful friends. It wasn't working. My (ex?)-boyfriend and I started seeing eachother again in the meantime and he did begin to work harder to win me back. It's been working and were basically back together though not ""officially"" -- whatever that means. Last night my sisters figured it out and barraged me for hours about how dissappointed they are in me and how sick they are that I would go back to him. \n My boyfriend is thoughtful, loving, caring, has never once lied to me, considerate, hard working (though unlucky), shares my same strong religious and political convictions, and is absolutely my soul mate in every regard. \n I love my family, we have always been  so  close, but they despise him. If they force me to choose between the two of them what do I do? The relationship could some day end but my family is around forever. Ironically my mother was horribly mistreated by her mother-in-law for being poor and ""unworthy"" of my dad but they stuck together and have had a wonderful nearly 40-year marriage. I feel like she's being hypocritical. Do I stick with my boyfriend or give up and conform to my family, as usual?"	My family doesn't approve of my boyfriend because he doesn't make a ton of money. They love me but they are super judgmental and harsh. Do I stick with my amazing boyfriend and flip my family the bird, or do I do what they say because they are around forever and sincerely care about me?	502	55	relationship_advice
First off, I want to apologize for the impending wall of text. \n Background (Her: 19F, Me: 19F): to make a long story short- there's a girl who I've known since middle school, and while we were never really the closest of friends, we hit it off pretty well. We would talk in class and hang out on the play ground. This goes on until freshman year when she transfers to a different high school. We pretty much all lost contact over our high school years with the exception of a few Facebook messages. \n A year passes after we both graduate from high school still little to no contact. It wasn't until about a month or so ago does she message me on Twitter saying the she wants to cultivate this friendship. We hit it off pretty well, exchanged numbers, text for a while and we start hanging out a few times, sometimes until 3 AM. But things seem to have fizzed out a little. We don't text like we used to or at least as much as I would like. \n So basically what I'm asking is: how do I get it across to her that I want to be really close friends with her? How do I get it across that I want to be that friend she turns to when she needs a ride or a shoulder to cry on? I want to be that guy she texts all the time. \n I'm hopeful we could get to this point, I mean, she admits to telling me things she depart tell her closest of friends. \n I realize this close of a friendship will take time, but I'm at a loss of what to do.	How do I become very close friends with somebody I haven't seen much of? \n Your help would be greatly appreciated!	284	20	relationship_advice
Sounds just like me and my ex. 3 kids, ages 4, 6 and 8 at the time of the divorce. We sat them down and explained to them what was going to happen, together, in a very civil manner. They don't see us fight, never have and they stayed first in both of our lives. I also bought a house about 2 miles away from my ex, practically in the same neighborhood (probably end up walking it or skating it this summer). My kids have adjusted very well. They have friends at my house, I have them every evening while my Ex works. \n Kids are very tough and as long as things stay civil they will be okay. Probably not at first.

Hey Reddit, I am a 22 y/o male and have recently been talking to a 27 y/o female with children. To get this part out of the way, the father is no longer around and she is not currently in a relationship. The child is very mature for their age and I think it's unlikely it would become a burden should we start dating. \n Now here's the issue, I got out of a long-term relationship not that long ago with a girl who was YOUNGER than me so I am kind of new to the whole older girl thing. The girl I am interested in is very good looking and shares mostly the same qualities as I do. We met through a mutual friend a while back and only just this past couple weeks have started chatting back and forth. She volunteers at the military installation I work at so several days ago she told me it was going to be a boring night so I offered to come hang out where she volunteers. We hit it off pretty well and I continued to drop by for a bit while she volunteered as she wasn't busy. We got into playing pool and had a nice time talking shit to one another as I kicked her ass (lol). And today we went running together and talked about pretty much anything and everything that came to our minds. Now she is such a sweetheart and I can't tell if she is just being nice to me or is possibly interested and wants to date. She has mentioned we should keep doing things (fishing,hang out, etc) but the only thing holding that back is our schedules. \n So Reddit, what is your take on this? Is she being nice or can I safely assume she is interested? Also, betafag	Interested in older girl, she is a sweetheart, not sure if she is being nice or wants to date, etc	305	20	relationship_advice
"X-post from relationships. \n I've been talking to this guy for over a year. We were just friends and only hung out as such. We started having more feelings for each other until he moved. We talked every day and we decided to visit each other in the next month to see if we might want to start doing a LDR. We've hung out plenty of times before but just as friends so we never spent time together as a couple. \n Anyway, I really like him. He's a great guy. He doesn't look exactly like what I remember. At all. But that doesn't bother me. He's a little out of shape. Not chubby exactly, just not in shape. Okay, maybe a little chubby. But anyway, I didn't think anything of it. He has a great personality and that's what I care about.\nUntil I started getting pictures. He'll send me pictures, NOT explicit ones. Just ones of his stomach. Or a bathroom selfie. Or one of his stomach hair which I don't really want to see. And I literally don't know how to respond. They are terrible. He'll say something like ""Here's a pic of my abs for you ;)"" or something of the sort. I normally really like confidence in a guy. And this is going to sound really awful of me. And I cannot figure out how to respond. \n This is what I've been doing. He immediately asks ""Do you like it?"" and I've been saying ""Of course, it's you"" or something of the sort. But I don't really want them. I don't care. If I did, I wouldn't still be talking to him. So how do I respond to these or explain that I don't want them?\nEven his face pictures are really kind of creepy. He smiles weird in them or tries to do some seductive expression. And it's just ICK.

"I've been dating my current girlfriend since high school, I was a senior, she was a junior. I graduated and went to a university 4 hours away, and we decided to give long distance a try. We made it through my first year not too bad, then she graduated and moved to a university only one hour away from me. That's better, but neither of us have cars, so it's still complicated and I don't get to see her as much as before. But it's almost summer break so we will both be right back home, only 5 minutes away from each other so I can see her more often. We've almost made it through my second year and her first year, but the last few weeks things have been changing. \n She has always been a somewhat Christian person, and I have always been an atheist, but we respect each others views and we do not try to change each other, so that has always worked out. But lately, she says that she's been wanting to get closer to God, like very close, she's been going to bible studies and church more often, and that's fine but she's changing. She told me for the first time not to use the lords name in vain when I fell and said ""god damnit"" about a week ago, when I've said it countless times before in the past and it didn't seem to bother her. That really, really bothered me. \n Now this is the interesting part. Last night she called me and said she wanted to wait to have sex until marriage. Okay, respectable decision, BUT, we've been having sex for the last year and a half. She says that she doesn't feel confident enough with her body to have it, but I feel like she's hiding something and just doesn't want to tell me, or she's pressuring me into marrying her. I do love her, I love spending time with her, I love talking with her, but I also love making love. I really don't want to break up with her and I honestly haven't the slightest idea what to say. \n Has anyone been in a situation like this, or know of anything to help?"

"I've recently become involved in a casual relationship with a friend I've known for 2+ years. We were very close friends a while back and he fell out of the group so we had not been in contact for a few months. \n Recently we came back into contact and we become intimate but nothing exclusive. (I really don't see him as the one for me anyway and we have never discussed it) \n Recently he has stood me up and I forgave him because he is a friend of mine and I understand sometimes things happen. It was maybe 2 weeks ago and beyond that he hasn't stood me up but when we decide to hang out he won't respond to calls or texts usually and will contact me around 9 to come over. I understand he has school and a lot of work within his intership but how hard is it to send a text saying ""Got a load of work, we can hang out around __ o'clock"" or just plain reschedule? \n Yesterday he texted me asking me to hang out tonight and I said yes. Well it is tonight. He answered one of my calls and I asked ""are we going to be meeting around 9 like usual?"" and he responded with ""No probably earlier"" then when I got off work I texted him and called with no response from him.

"For my wedding we had a bridesmaid go through a horrible breakup with a groomsman. The rehearsal dinner was the first time we had seen the two of them in the same room and there was obvious tension there; so much so, that my Maid of Honor asked if they were secretly getting it on because there were so many stolen glances.  Anyway, we tried to make things as comfortable as possible for them.  We asked if the ""jobs"" were something they could still do and they both said yes.  So we made sure not to pair them up for the walk down the aisle - I had three bridesmaids and one was married and pregnant so I also didn't feel comfortable with her walking down with someone who wasn't her husband, so the two of them walked down together and my MoH walked with the Best Man.  Unfortunately, the bridesmaid couldn't be mature about the whole thing and once the ceremony was done, she went and demanded they ""talk things over"" right there.

"Work. \n Relationships, no matter how compatible the two individuals may be, require constant attention.  It's like a garden.  You can simply plant the seeds, add water, and wait in time plants will grow.  However, without any additional attention weeds will take root as well.  Eventually those weeds will suffocate the nutrients straight from the plants. \n That said, just like a garden, if you tend to it DAILY (at minimum) then you will have a bountiful harvest of whatever crop you decide to seed. \n Long story short, don't go in to a relationship lightly.  I had a rule when I was dating (that was a long effin time ago and, I don't think dating is the same anymore) that if I didn't see the possibility of the relationship being long term (as in she's ""the one"") then I broke it off. It avoids the inevitable heartbreak that only worsens as two individuals become closer over time.  My thought was that if she's not it now then I'm only going to hurt her, or get hurt myself, down the road. \n What has made my relationship last above and beyond EVERYTHING else is communication.  Full and complete honesty establishes integrity between the pair.  This promotes trust, and allows for the couple to continue their separate lives individually without causing the partner to fear the ""worst.""  Have I screwed up? Hell yes, everyone makes mistakes.  The point in a relationship is that mistakes should only be bumps on the road through life together.  You wouldn't hit a speed bump and then just get out of the car and give up on it as a vehicle. The same holds true in a long term relationship.  Petty squabbles are just that, given time and an urge to compromise all things can be worked out. \n Everyone in a relationship will eventually have a disagreement, it is how you handle that which will determine the outcome of your relationship."	Communication and compromise are essential in a good relationship. These actions promote trust, which can promulgate a positive and happy relationship.	321	21	relationship_advice
"Just for the sake of simplicity let's say I am in my last year of high school* and there's this girl in my class that I've been obsessing over for the past year. I'm 19, she's younger by 1.5 years.

The thing is, I can't seem to get my mind off her - I have a MASSIVE crush. I haven't really made myself ""evident"" to her, but I try to be really nice, and she responds to that. But that's it. She has a boyfriend and there's nothing I can do or think of doing that's going to win me points in the right direction. To top it off, she is an introvert just like me, and I'm really having a hard time figuring out when she's enjoying a joke or being in my company. Honestly I could be too old for her. I don't really care for that, because my body chemicals are telling me otherwise. And I'm ready to bend like the spoon Neo bent in the Matrix. I have to say that one good thing has come out of this: I've been more outgoing and socializing a lot more in an attempt to gain some skills, curb this obsession and man-up to ask her out for a date.

I don't know if it matters but the ones that have slowly pulled away have all been engineers of some sort (I'm not intentionally choosing engineers, I just seem to attract them).

Long story short, my friend (let's call her Louise) is a sophomore in college, I'm a freshman. I took a year off, was looking at places, she suggested I visit her, like it here, and long story short, I got recruited to go there this year. I'm happy with how things are going between me and Louise, except when she goes out to parties with me. I'm more of an extrovert who likes to meet new people, and she usually sits back, clings to me because I'm the only person she knows, and relies on me for interaction to the point where I'm suffocated. This seems to be a fairly recurring problem, and I only decided to address it now after this incident. \n I've been hooking up with another girl for about two weeks now (call her Julia), and there's mutual interest. Louise knows about Julia, and I firmly told Louise \u201cDo not make it look like we're a thing, and keep your distance if she's at the party so I can do my thing with her.\u201d I think it's okay, and I plan to just stay home and invite Julia up to my room to watch a movie. She gets to me first, and she basically asks if she can tag along with me at The Usual Place. I usually roll in solo and mingle with everyone there. We make plans to meet up, \n I'm later than she is, and she's obviously into me. We vibe for about fifteen minutes, and then, Louise shows up (she knows me well enough to know that I'm always there). She tries to wing for me, but when I leave to talk to my friends, she follows me. I can't get an inch of space the entire night, about an hour later Julia gives up and finds some other guy, and when Louise leaves, I noticeably perk up. After the next thirty minutes of going in, I go home to my friends and just go on a rant about Louise. \n I know I'm an emotional wreck, so I just sleep off the alcohol and have the talk with her in the morning. I say \u201cI appreciate your friendship, but you were way too clingy last night. Julia actually asked me to party with her, and you basically monopolized me to the point where I could barely talk to her. I need to be my own person.\u201d She says something to the effect of \u201cI'm so sorry! I was drunk and I didn't know anybody else there!\u201d I'm not very satisfied with this \u2013 after all I explicitly told her not to cling, and she did anyway. \n I have no romantic/sexual interest in Louise, and considering she's looking towards me to find her a guy for her, I'm pretty sure she doesn't have interest in me. I have no idea if she's starting to get feelings for me or if it's just clinginess, but I want her to stop clinging. I'm not overly confident that she's going to stop \u2013 she's not the best at handling herself when she's drunk. She also has a history of jealousy because I was spending time with other friends and not her. If it happens again, how do I handle it?

So, I really liked this girl(we are both 18) for a year now (we are classmates, now in our senior year), and last month she told me she had feelings for me too. \n We started dating, going out and kissing and all seemed great untill we went to a bar with some friends and she started making out with some random dude she found there, and she spent whole night with him. \n I tried to end whatever we had together, but she told me next day that she was really sorry and that she was drunk, so I forgave her. \n Fast forward till this week, i know she is still constantly talking with that guy, and even seeing him (I'm not supposed to know this). Even more, she started spending more time with her ex, who is still in her group of friends. \n I know that my chances are probably gone, and I'm trying to get over her, but the thing is we still have 2 months of classes together and I can't just ignore her, she's a very sensitive person and she always complained to me that she doesn't have close friends around her. \n Also, I have an extremely important exam to take in 2 months, and I just can't focus on studying because I always think about her and what she is doing, I even check her FB and her friends' FB every hour or so.

"I met my boyfriend this summer and while at the time I realized he wasn't my usual ""type"" I still found him very attractive. He had a job working outside, loved swimming and biking, and was very active and ""outdoorsy."" I loved that he was always busy and always wanted me around to go do things with him. All his hobbies and his job gave him a nice color, and he was in pretty good shape. I'm not sure what happened, but now that school has started and it's colder outside he has completely stopped trying. He has gained at least 40 pounds (which I believe is now making him snore at night) and although he complains about his weight gain constantly he continues to eat incredibly unhealthy foods in huge portions. He is growing out his hair to donate and even though it's long enough to cut off now, he continues to keep growing it so it's now longer than mine (past the collarbone). This is also something he no longer takes care of and it is constantly greasy and unkempt. He is still the sweetest guy I have ever met, but my lack of physical attraction to him now is making me feel like a terrible person. I no longer want to have sex with him, and he has definitely noticed. Even worse, I'm afraid any affection he shows is a lead-up to sex, so I can't even enjoy anything physical with him anymore (kissing, cuddling, etc...) Can I still salvage this, or is this not something that can be fixed?"	My boyfriend's recent weight gain has caused me to lose my attraction him. Is this a deal breaker?	263	18	relationship_advice
"For the last few years I've been working a dead end retail job and over that time I've got friendly with the other staff and managers. About a year ago one of my managers, an older female, added me on Facebook. Now I don't use Facebook all that much so I thought what the hell, I have nothing to hide and accepted her friend request. \n Every now and then she'd message me with some tongue in cheek innuendo stuff, nothing too near the mark so to speak and I thought nothing of it. That is until one night when she got into conversation with me and ended up sending me nude photos. \n I was pretty shocked because I've always just seen her as my manager, I didn't really respond and she eventually apologised for the whole thing. After I accepted her apology she took that as a sign that her behavior was okay and she started getting more and more sexual towards me both online and in person at my workplace. \n For months she bombarded me with messages on all media platforms, feeling rather fed up with the situation I just replied with overtly sexual replies to try and fend her off, thinking she'd get her fill and leave me alone. Stupidly this only stoked the fire so to speak and gave her freedom to send me all sorts of explicit material. \n I left my job, mainly because of physical health problems but partially because of this constant sexual barrage I was recieving. I should've reported her behaviour to HR but at this point I felt like I'd also acted unprofessionally in trying to fend her off and I didn't think I'd be returning to the job. \n A few months later my physical health had greatly improved and I was able to return to work, my other boss offered me a good position back at the same company and after weighing up the cons and pros I couldn't not afford to turn the job down. The first few months were fine, the boss who had been messaging me etc. left me alone but it wasn't long before she was showering me lavish gifts to try and woo me, I kept telling her I wasn't interested in a relationship of any sorts. This didn't stop her, it seems only to drive her on as if I'm playing hard to get. Now the rumour is circulating among colleagues that her husband is leaving her because she's been ""playing around"". I'm terrified that I'm going to be on the other end of a violent encounter with the husband, be fired for gross misconduct and worst of all bring shame to myself and family. \n My contract expires in less than a month and my imminent leaving has driven this woman into overdrive, the lavish gifts keep coming no matter how many times I tell her she shouldn't be buying me things, she's begging me for sexual relations and I'm worried that she's going to do something very stupid (she's become a bit of an alcoholic) due to her unstable emotional nature."

For some reason just my luck, every guy I dated is family oriented but my current boyfriend is much more and has 'crossed' the line for me. \n He loves hanging out with his cousins and sister who he grew up with. Everytime I hang out with them in the big group, I feel so lonely but physcially I am not alone. I try so hard and I am very social. Right now it feels like going to a new high school and trying break into another clique group I don't belong. It is always ME trying to get to know his cousins. Don't get me wrong, they are good people but I constantly feel like I am at a wedding hearing all their inside jokes and good memories. I feel like I tag alone. \n I am the kind of women who wants my own family. By this I mean if me and him get marry, I don't want to live with his parents. Family to me would be me and him and our 'future kids' not me,him, cousins, sisters, brothers, cousins, parents  from both sides.

So I have asked him to forgive and not take it personal that from here now on I am not interested in going to hanging out with his cousins/family. \n The weird thing is, it is so much easier to get along with his 'actual' friends.

Warning: This will probably sound extremely immature. \n I am currently seeing a girl that I've been interested in for a long time now. We are having fun and it's been a great time. However, I find myself becoming a little over protective of her which is weird because we aren't that serious, but she's on my mind constantly and I really like her. \n She has this guy friend who she talks to all the time. I know this shouldn't be a problem but I find myself thinking about it all the time. They seem to always be texting but she lets me read them and there is nothing fishy going on.

I\u2019m not sure where to start, but I guess I\u2019ll jump in with this: I love him.  I love him, I care about him, and I have great affection for him (which are not necessarily the same things if you think about it).  That isn\u2019t to say that we had a relationship.  We didn\u2019t, but we were friends.  I thought we were good friends.  I always looked forward to seeing him, and I know he felt the same way \u2013 from what he said to me, and what he told other people. \n But I haven\u2019t seen him in many months, due to crazy life circumstances on both our parts.  There was some indication that he may have been having some psych issues around that time, but no one knows for sure.  At this point he is not replying to any communication from me or from our mutual friends and we don\u2019t know where he's living. \n Now, on to my question.  Put yourself in his shoes. (with this admittedly limited back story)  If you or your life goals/desires/circumstances changed enough that you were distancing yourself from people from a large sector of your life, would you want to be sought out?  Basically, am I turning myself into an obsessive, restraining-order-worthy stalker if I try to find him?  Do I just need to get over this and move on?

"I've been dating this girl for three years and in these three years have had the time of my life. I took her virginity and we both fell in love. Looking back, I fell harder than I should have because in the beginning I wasn't serious about the relationship. Now after three years, I am known by her grandparents, parents, and her siblings as (Her name here)'s husband. I never wanted to drag her through this and I feel like complete shit for doing it to her. She loves me way more than I love her and I don't know how to break up with her. \n I've tried to end it 3 times and they all resulted in both of us running back to the other crying and begging for forgiveness/another chance.

"My girlfriend of almost 6 months does not treat me that great. I literally bend over backwards to do anything and everything for her, her older brother and her friends think I'm crazy because I'm so nice to her, and to be fair I am a little crazy with regards to how much I love her. \n To use an example, at a party last Saturday I was in mid conversation with her when she turned around to try and talk to another boy. This upset me a little, which I tried to surpress, but my friend tried to make her see she'd hurt me, and I was asking him to stop because I didn't want to make a scene. \n She got upset with me, and I went to go find her and apologise, despite me doing nothing wrong. She started shouting at me saying why did you shout at me, and I was calmly trying to tell her I didn't and that I was sorry, and she just kept shouting go away (bear in mind that prior to this party I biked 7 miles in the pouring rain to go and pick up her drink for her). \n I walked outside to cool off, and I went back inside to find her, and again, apologise, so we could be on good terms for the rest of the evening. When I found her she was still shouting at me, putting me in tears, and her friends told her if she didn't stop being a bitch to me that they'd just walk off and leave her to sulk alone. \n One of her friends could relate to our relationship, and she looked at me and told me that I need to walk off and let G (my girlfriend) realise what she's doing wrong, I can't keep being nice to her because she just knows whatever she does she will get my forgiveness. I told G's friend I can't hurt her no matter what, I physically don't have it within myself. \n G's friend started to cry, and although I was crying too, G told me to go away because, and I quote, ""my friend is crying"". So I did that, I left, and went to go and sit alone. \n After this party I was walking her home to make sure she was safe, and she wouldn't stop telling me how much I embarrassed her and how I made her friends think she was a bitch and how they're all going to hate her, and how she just wanted to have a nice time but I ruined that for her. \n This is not an off occasion, things are always like this with her. I'm told that I need to be mean, but that is completely illogical. I want her to show me more love, so I treat her badly too? Either way I can't be mean to her when I look into her eyes. When people ask why I put up with it, it's because I devote everything to her happiness, and when we're good I completely forget about the bad. \n If it makes any difference, she treats her mother similarly to how she treats me, and doesn't realise she's doing anything wrong. \n I really don't want to leave her. I love her a whole lot, and I get the feeling other people will not have the patience I do for her, meaning they would not put up with her for long. \n What do I do? \n ["	I am a saint to my girlfriend, she treats me like shit in return, but I make her happy, and don't want to leave her.	581	25	relationship_advice

"I (19/m) have been with my girlfriend (19/f) for almost a year and a half, but we have a lot of history since we have been on and off since the eighth grade. We are now going into our sophomore years in college. Over the past year and a half, her and I have had our fair share of rough patches. Most of the time it was because I was with friends and wouldn't ditch them to be with her or things of that nature. Almost every time these situations ended with her trying to break up with me and me having to talk her out of it. Every time it happened I told her she couldn't do it anymore, yet the pattern continued. \n Recently we had a big argument and she told me I could ""go die."" She apologized but it stayed in the back of my mind. So a few days later I went to her house and broke up with her. Later that day she drove to my house and begged me to take her back, and I did. \n Since then, she hasn't tried to break up with me again, arguments have been minimal (I suspect because she doesn't want an argument to escalate to a breakup), sex has been nonstop (I suspect because she wants to make me want to stay with her more), and things have generally just been fine between us. Even though things have been going well lately, I feel a little bored and apathetic in my relationship. I'm not sure if it's because I'm young and want to experience new things or if it's because there's no fighting between me and my girlfriend.

Lately she's developed an interest in marijuana and had a desire to smoke it.\nI personally have no interest in marijuana (though I do support the legalization of it) however I have lost countless childhood friends throughout my high school career due to the mistakes they've made by abusing the drug and the way weed has changed them.

In my opinion, I don't think it's that much to ask my girlfriend not to participate in something that's already illegal to begin with that I don't feel comfortable with due to my past. I don't ask hardly anything of her except for this.\nI feel like if she's willing to ignore my one request (which I find rather simple and reasonable) then she doesn't consider my feelings too highly and that there are loads of other more heart breaking things that she would be willing to do without considering how I'd feel (i.e. cheating, cutting, etc). \nI feel like breaking up with her over something like this would be very complicated and probably land me a horrible reputation as ""the guy who dumped is childhood girlfriend because of something as trivial as weed"".

My boyfriend, Michael, is friends with Stan. I've known Stan and his wife, Paula, for years, but not well. One night out Stan played with my leg, grabbed my ass, and tried to kiss me. I firmly brushed him off. I told Michael when we got home, not wanting to make a scene. He was pissed at his friend, but agreed a scene wasn't the way to handle it. I was debating on what I should tell Paula. She's a good friend of a friend, but we've never been close. I don't even have her number. \n The next day I got a bunch of facebook messages from a guy that's been flirting with me for about a year. It's an obviously fake profile, fake name, fake pic. I added him because he knew enough about me that I figured he did know me, and I'd eventually figure out who he was. I started to suspect he might be Stan. \n After a little more investigation and a 'test' (see, Stan would know stuff about my boyfriend and text him, like when I called him Michael my jellybean. We assumed Paula had told him, as Stan doesn't have a fb. So, I tested him by blocking Paula), I confirmed that Stan is the fake facebook guy that has been hitting on me for a year. \n And not just me. Basically, most of her friends. And he says very sexual things, very blunt things. One of his 'victims' is his wife's sister. That's messed up! \n I think Paula should know. How do I tell her?

She was hired about 4 months ago, and I could tell immediately that we had a connection, particularly since we were both from out of town.

Up until now, thing have been fantastic, but her and I don't have many other friends in the area besides each other, so she asked me if I would go to church with her. \nNow since I began college, I've always been disenchanted with the idea of religion, since my father used to wield it as a weapon of control over me, and my fascination with scientific discovery.

Our debates regarding religion intensified until I began to realize that she thought she couldn't be in a relationship with me if I believe what i did.

I still ended it though. we talked for a few hours and she told me the truth about everything. i didnt tell her I lurked her facebook the night of  just that i did a week ago when i saw the other stuff and then she told me she hung out with him that night and what happen.  all is good i guess.  thank you all for the help.

I apologize now for any grammar or spelling mistakes, I am in a panic. \n About a week ago I log onto Facebook on my Gaming/Video Editing computer (a computer i don't normally use facebook or anything for that matter) and i see a new message from a guy with some flirting going on. I quickly realize its not my facebook but my girlfirned left her facebook logged in. I begin to read more since the conversation is somewhat dirty and explicit. There is mention of hanging out (ok fine whatever, they have hung out so it appears but it was kept a secret from me) The person she speaks to almost constantly asks her for blowjobs in a joking way. But it seems like more than joking since the talks often go into detail about blowjobs and other sexual acts.  The guy is weird and constatnly asks her for one (weather it be joking or not, I dont know) \n (sorry for the wall) \n Anyway flash forward to right now, (well an hour ago) my grilfriend got off work at 9:45 said she was on the bus, didnt hear back from her till about 1030 ( i was worried and sent a few texts asking if she got home ok) it is unlike her to go more than like 5 minutes without responding. she quicky sends like 5 messages in a row saying ""yeah sorry i was getting a snack, washed up now im going to go to bed good night!"" very strange. So i go on my other PC and check her facebook ( i feel horrible for doing this, i feel like i am envading her privacy) (i dont do it regularly this is probably the third time since the accident) And i see that he is giving her directions to his house and she is crrently walking there and plans for a massage and a movie)  so as of right now  she is ""sleeping"" and i am here panicing/freaking out  what the fuck do i do?  I know i have to break up wtih her, but how? when? Do i tell her i invaded her privacy? \n edit:  I know lots of relationships the couples hang out with the oposit sex alone, but in ours it is un heard of and if the tables were turned i would be fucked. Altohught i would never do it. \n Edit2: ok so i checked her messages again just now and she is home. she sent him a message saying ""im sorry"" one hour ago. he responded with ""haha its ok"" her: "" i feel so dumb!"" him: ""lmfaoooo"" her: ""dont even make fun. hey nice tweet a hole. just gunna ignore me now? lol"" \n So it looks like maybe she felt guilty and left? maybe during a sexual act? Idk. i could just be paranoid. \n Edit3: going to try and sleep or read or something. Have to work tomorrow. still unsure on how i am going to approach this.  What i do know for sure is this relationship is over.  Thank you for the help. More advice is welcome and I will update you as more happens."

I'll try to be brief. I've been married ~1.5 years. We've been together for ~3. My wife is significantly younger, and we were engaged after dating only a few months as my wife was entering the air force. We both were happy with where we were at, wanted to be together and pulled the trigger. \n Skipping the majority of details, she cheated on me about a year ago while off at training for the AF. I felt a little pressured, wasn't happy with the situation, and while I did agree at the time (described as an open relationship) I was not totally comfortable. Maybe that was my first mistake, I don't know. Anyway, we talked, decided against continuing that. ~9 months ago she cheated with the same person who happened to end up at the same base while I was out of town. I was crushed. I actually found out about it ahead of time & caught her in the act, but that's less important now. \n Over the past 9 months, we've gone to two therapists, one whom she hated and another whom we have not seen any results from. I have given her ultimatums but she has continued to press the boundaries - talking inappropriately, etc. She swears nothing has happened in awhile, and while I have enough confidence to believe her, I don't know if things can go back to being how they were before. We constantly fight and just plain don't get along. \n I don't want to be alone, and neither does she. When she's genuine, she's a great person to be around. She's very strong, intelligent and down to earth. I tend to be more out there, laid back and mature (I know, the age has something to do with it). At this point though, I'm stuck; do I continue to try to fix things, and how do I do that when it feels like we've tried everything? Do I call it quits, and not only crush her but also hurt myself in the process? How long do I keep working at this, and when do I know if it's over or if this is something that working through will bring us to where we want to be?

I started university in 2014, and while my first semester went really well I ended up failing all my second semester subjects due to my anxiety and depression hitting quite hard. As a result I'll be repeating all those failed subject in the first semester of this year. \n None of my family and friends have any idea, and for various reasons it is essential it stays that way. The issue is, those subject I'm repeating are exclusively for first year students, so I don't know what I will say to anyone I meet in those classes. \n Do I lie and say I'm a first year student? What if they meet one of my friends who knows I'm a second year student? And I don't want to be lying to people. What if I become good friends with someone I meet in those classes, how long will I be lying them for? \n Do I make a smaller lie and say I took a semester off? The issues are the same for this option. \n Do I admit I failed the subjects? But again, what if they meet my friends or family? If anyone has any advice or input I would very much appreciate it.	Failed my second university semester due to anxiety/depression. Friends/Family can't and don't know.

Basically I have a pretty good relationship with her. Most of the time we have a pretty nice time together. Frequently though there are things about her that have made me question our relationship. She suffers from depression, but refuses to get any help from it. Which is frustrating, I have depression issues too, but every time I bring my issues up, it ends up becoming about our issues. The conversation always seems to center around her issues, like she is acting as if they are more important then mine. Which is irritating. She also has horrible allergies and has recently rescued a pet dog from the street, which is really nice of her....but she can't breathe and won't give up the dog. I can't stand being around someone that sounds like they have a cold 24/7. She is stubborn though. And acts all hurt when I bring up that I don't want to sleep at her place because her allergies prevent me from sleeping. (My roommate also has a dog so little help there.) \n But despite these things I'm reasonably happy with her, but I don't feel particularly motivated to really try hard with our relationship because she loves me unconditionally. I just feel like I hurt her feelings all the time, but she likes me more than I like her. I have been lazy and a shitty person. I mean I do like her and do nice things for her, but she requires so much of my time, she is very needy and I am more dependent. \n However there is another girl I have been talking to, that I have been thinking about. She seems really great. I'm just not sure what to do about any of this. I feel awful, but I am considering breaking up with my girlfriend and pursuing something with this person. But am I crazy for giving up a reasonably good relationship for something that might be a good thing. I don't know. It just makes me feel bad. Any advice would be appreciated.	my relationship is good, but maybe there is something out there better for me. Feeling bad about things.	341	18	relationship_advice
Dear Redditors,\nI really hope that someone could help me with this problem. I really don't know what to do anymore.. \n So, I have a best friend, Z. and I'm afraid that she's recently been lying to me and her other close friends. Z. and I are pretty close, I don't think that I have any secrets for her and I know she considers me her best friend. \n So Z. has always told me stories about a friend of hers (J.), who lives in a town about an hour away from our town. (We live a non-English speaking European country, which is why my English is far from perfect.) J. was a former neigbor of Z. and Z. visited J. about once every 3-4 weeks. J. has a history of depression, panic attacks and suicide attempts. She was in a private clinic for those problems since november I suppose. Due to her mental health, Z's parents didn't want her to see J. anymore, so all of these visites were done in secret for the last 4 years. It is important to keep in mind that both me and Z. still live with our parents. \n So last week I got a phone call from Z. She was crying hysterically and eventually told me that J. had died. I don't know exactly what has happened, but I know that she's commited suicide. J. was allowed to go home from the clinic for TWO HOURS and all the while, her boyfriend, parents and Z. where with her. So I really do not understand what could have happened and Z. refuses to tell us. \n I have been thinking about this story and there are things that just don't add up. We [the whole friend group that Z. and I are in] have never met this 'J.', we haven't even seen a photo of her. Also, Z. has gone to visit J's parents [they live abroad] with her for a week last summer, but Z. has never showed us any photo's of her trip. Also, how could she have been away from her parents for a whole week without them noticing that she was in a fucking other country?! \nAs far as I can see, there are no police reports from the day that J. died in her hometown. Although there are some ambulance reports that could have been for her, I'm sure the police must have been there, right? \nZ. told us that they wanted to strew(?) J's ashes this weekend, which is impossible, since you have to wait for at least three months to pick up the remains of a family member. (I hope this sencence made sense..) But I was stupid enough to tell her so, and she hasn't talked about the ashes since I did so. \nAnd how could she have hidden this from her parents? She was really upset, and I'm sure my parents would have noticed something like that. \n All of this really affects the way I feel about her and our friendship. I just want to know the truth.. \nThe only problem is that Z. and I have to do some sort of really important assignment together for school. (I don't think they have a similar thing in America-England, but it sort of determines whether you'll graduate or not..) So if I confront her about it, that probably means the end of our friendship and I don't think we'll be able to complete the assignment together.	My best friend is possibly lying about the death of a close friend of her and I don't know what to do any more.	578	24	relationship_advice
Specifically, I just have  no idea  on the logistics of everything. In a nutshell, here's our deal: \n \n I'm 26, and currently live in America, she's 29 and currently lives in London \n We met while I was in graduate school, but my visa ran out and so now I'm back in America, have been for about 7 months, but we've seen each other intermittently since then \n We've been together for around 2 years \n She and I have talked about the possibility of marriage with positive results, and we would both be looking to stay in the UK \n \n And despite getting married being something billions of people have done, I feel like a complete fool for not knowing more. So I have so what seems like a million (ok, not really a million) questions about the logistics of making the woman of my dreams my fianc\xe9e: \n \n What in the world is deal with engagement rings vs. wedding rings/bands? What do I do here? Do I buy an engagement ring and later pick out an entirely separate wedding ring? Or does the band go around the ring? Am I buying one ring, only to buy another one later, rendering the first one moot? What in the world is going on there? \n I know that the whole 2-3 months salary on a ring is diamond company marketing, but how much should I really be looking to spend? In a few months time (when I look to propose), I'll have about $20k in semi-disposable income unrelated to any of my bills/payments/etc. But then, of course, we'll have the wedding to look at, I suppose..... \n What are your opinions on buying a ring in person vs. buying online? I know that in person, I'll be able to see firsthand the quality, but I often read that brick-and-mortar stores are  very  marked up in price. Advice? Double advice if I could get advice on the both the US  and  the UK side. Also, haggling: can I do that with jewelers? \n Is there anything/anyplace that I should specifically steer clear of? \n \n The rest are less logistical and more just general advice, I suppose: \n \n How should I get her ring size? She hardly ever wears any rings and obviously, me being in another continent means I can't snoop through her jewelry drawer myself. But she does have a male flatmate. Would it be wrong to ask him to nick a ring and get it sized? \n I have a couple options in terms of buying/proposing. In a few months it'll be her 30th birthday, and I'll be in London with her for that, should I do some shopping around with her there, casually enter jewelry shops, take note of what she likes, and then hold off on proposing until the next time I'm there (about 3 more months after that)? Or should I buy here in the states now and do it around her birthday (not on her birthday or anything, just while I'm there for those few weeks)?	How do I buy an engagement ring? And other questions on getting engaged. \n So sorry for the length. But I'll definitely reward you with all the sweet delicious comment karma I can muster (disclaimer: loveisamany can only muster 1 karma per comment)	499	42	relationship_advice
"man, first let me say I'm sorry. I really don't know where to begin. \n 3 1/2 years is a bit stretch of a good time to talk about marriage (at least in my head), It's not TOO long but it's also not too short. I think the underlying issue is his unwillingness to compromise. I've found that the key to a good foundation of any relationship is finding that balance of need / want and being able to compromise with your significant other. You're spot on in saying that he doesn't have his priorities in order (namely, you) but he has also simultaneously losing a grip of reality. \n From the way you write it seems you are very independent and aren't looking for the kind of guy that swoons over you constantly, but rather let's you live your life while also cherishing the time spent together but aren't joined at the hip. You seek assistance from him (not in a dependent kind of way but more of a on the same wavelength) but that's what helps a relationship foster and grow. I really can't even fathom where this guy is coming from since what he is doing is absolutely obnoxious. \n There's a fine line in being a good boyfriend and just ""being"" there. He may act like your boyfriend, talk like your boyfriend but at the end of the day if he isn't even willing to meet you halfway on certain things (while expecting you to do them) but instead chooses to self-indulge on his hobbies (and then subsequently complain about his lack of money) there is something wrong. You need to address the elephant in the room and really talk to him about this. The way he is treating this relationship is not right AT ALL and he is doing a disservice to you. I suggest putting the engagement talk on hold until you see him fix his mannerisms. \n I don't make a whole lot of money, barely under 65k and even I find it in me to take my girlfriend out or pay for my friends or my family. It's about care and compassion and for some reason your boyfriend is lacking in that department to a certain degree - that needs to be fixed. \n Good luck! \n *"	Your boyfriends spending spree behavior is not conducive to your relationship and bodes ill for an engagement / marriage.

Me and this girl have being seeing each other for quite some time now, constantly talking all night, hanging out 24/7 and confessed the way we feel about each other.\nAnyway, she has said to me that she loves me, never felt this way about anyone before and wants to take this relationship further (Said on Sunday) and the next day she said she wanted a break and so I backed off a bit, while still keeping some small chit chat to show I haven't forgotten about her,  now she doesn't want a relationship at all and doesn't give me a reason why and is being rather distant and won't talk about it and fix this!

Hi guys, thanks for reading. Long story so I'll try to keep it as short as possible. \n I'm 1 month out of a 2.5 year relationship, mutual breakup but my decision (if that makes sense). I've had a crush on my piano teacher since the day I first met her (~5 months ago). Basically I feel something with this girl that I never felt with my ex. \n Typically my lessons with her are 30 mins long, but shes a dedicated teacher and wont worry about staying back longer if it's just not enough time. She does that for me, but then we end up chatting for hours on end about anything (not music / piano related) and so I've grown quite fond of her. I'm sure she too likes me as a friend and perhaps more (but that's getting optimistic). \n What I guess I want to do is leverage this into a friendship at the moment, but not quite sure how to extend the friendship outside of the studio. I want to add her on Facebook and get some back and forth conversation going like we in the studio but not quite sure on how to get there. \n Typically, I have no problem with this sort of thing, I've had a number of relationships in my adult life, but there's something about this girl that makes me a bit nervous and makes me really not want to stuff this up. \n To keep this short, here are just extra bits of relevant info \n \n I don't pay her directly for the piano lessons, shes payed by the studio, I pay studio. \n She's never had a relationship before \n Don't want her to seem like a rebound, \n Don't even really want to go into a relationship again just yet (Nor am i looking for sex only type stuff) but can't stop thinking of her.	out of 2.5 yr relationship, have big crush on new girl even when i was with ex girl, awkward situation as shes my piano teacher, want to friendzone myself for a while before I move in.	310	36	relationship_advice
"I've recently begun carpooling with a girl and it has been ""interesting"". All the books and practice with girls is really paying off. Although I've been burned before, looking to see how I can escalate this or if I am doing this properly and I'm looking to the reddit brain-trust to give me some direction, guidance, high fives and advice. \n I guess I'll give some backstory: \n We've been carpooling for 2 weeks now, but have been working together for a few months but I never really paid much attention to her. Then this opportunity to carpool was too good to pass up, save money and go to work with a pretty girl? yes please! \n She is pretty, although I've never admitted that to her, I just tell her she's ""easy on the eyes"", as for myself I'm what girls call ""cute"". Our conversations involve her leading and me listening, giving feedback and input when necessary, she is always the first one to break the ""awkward silence"" whereas I am quite comfortable with it. She has broken the touch barrier and I have received the ""look back"" (her looking back as she's walking away or going into her house.) She is having guy problems but under the circumstances I let her know that ""I won't be THAT guy for her"" I would be willing to be any other guy just not THAT(shoulder to cry on) guy. \n Now here's where I get confused(or screwed), after putting my foot down about being ""that"" guy, we got stuck in traffic after happy hour with some co-workers and I asked if she was ok. Her reply was that she was not so I pressed her (mistake on my end?) her reply was ""you won't let me talk about it"" After a few minutes of silence on my end, I relented with ""we're stuck in traffic for a while, this will be the first, last and only time we will discuss this, kapeesh?"" The rest of the ride home we discussed her relationship or lack of one and problems with her guy, I gave advice and broke my rule I should throw in the towel, friendzoned. Days after our discussion she was ""happier"" and laughing and smiling more than usual. She did break the touch barrier by giving me an example of how someone touched her shoulder at work to get her attention ( she had never broken the touch barrier before) \n I myself had been escalating by asking her questions about myself, (ie. Ask her to identify what qualities I possess that girls or herself would look for in a mate.) After naming a handful she said easy going followed by ""yea I definitely need a guy that is easy going, cause I am not, *laughter"" Now in my head that statement sounds like she's checked out of her relationship already (someone please correct me if I am wrong) Now I'd like to point out she had brought up the topic of how to meet people which snowballed into the dating and subsequently the list of dealbreakers/qualities for a mate. \n Right now, I am keeping busy and going on dates with other women so she's not the only option.

Throwaway because my boyfriend is a Redittor. He has been getting more and more distant lately. When I've sporadically asked him about what's wrong, he says everything is fine and he loves me and living with me. I moved to the current city we live in to be with him after being in an LDR for a year and a half. I've had a hard time adjusting since then, and my depression has been really difficult for him to understand, but he's been supportive. \n We got in a big fight a few days ago because he hadn't gotten a hold of me after he got off work (he's a bartender), or four hours afterwards while he was at a bar. I had called him a few times, because normally he at least texts me when he's done and if he's going out. He is ALWAYS on his phone, so I assumed he ignored the missed calls from me. When I brought this up, he freaked out and yelled at me (which is totally out of character), and said he was going to his friend's house. Instead, he came home that night, we had a big talk, and I felt a lot better about going forward in our relationship (with a lot to work on). \n Well, my MacBook power cord gave out about a week ago, and while I was waiting for a new one to be shipped out, I used his computer in the meantime. I'm currently looking for a new job. For some reason, I couldn't find a posting for a job I was interested in that I had seen previously on my laptop, and looked through his history to find the Craigslist post. A bunch of posts for studio and 1-bedroom apartments came up. \n I feel terrible about this, but he always keeps his email logged in in another tab, and I switched over to see if he had emailed anyone about apartments. Sure enough, first email is to somebody saying he wants to move in on 1/1, and setting up a walk through. \n He has told me that he wants to keep working on the relationship and continue living with me. How do I confront him about this? The prospect of him leaving is heartbreaking on not only a mentally/emotionally level, but financially. He makes a bit more than I do, so he pays more of the bills. I don't know if he thinks he'll continue to pay rent here and at the new place, as well as double utility bills, cable, etc. If he moves out, I'm completely fucked. Our lease isn't up until June. \n Reddit, what do I do? I'm living in this city with almost no support group, and my family and friends live 2,000 miles away. I am very much still in love with him, and was excited about working on relationship (and myself) to get to a much better place. How do I confront him? What do I do? \n edit:	Increasingly distant live-in boyfriend is looking for new apartment on Craigslist, while telling me everything is fine and wants to work on our relationship.	498	24	relationship_advice
Firstly I apologize for being on mobile, second, this is a throwaway for obvious reasons. Anyway, \n So about 7 months ago I started dating a guy who I had known for about 6 months. Things went okay, really fun at first but I was in a bad place in my life and didn't really put the care and effort into the relationship like I should have, and he had stuff from his past come up, so we sort of took a break after the 4 month mark of dating. It wasn't really clear if it was an actual break up or just some sort of hiatus, but I just left things alone and we sort of moved our separate ways. (We also work together so seeing him everyday gave us no real choice but to be civil and friendly to each other, but there were no hard feelings or bitterness at all. Just a mutual understanding of bad timing for both of us.) \n So fast forward to now. After a couple months of not being together, the flirting started to pick up, the texting began again, and I hung out with him for the first time in about 4 months which was really nice. We talked a lot about our past and apologies were said and overall it felt nice but different (in the best way possible) we are both in a much better place in our lives and things were just more fun and open between us. \nHowever, things went a little far and we ended up having (incredible!) sex and I stayed the night at his place and left early the next morning (when he left for work) \n So here's my question reddit. I want to ask him what exactly we are doing, but is it too soon? I just want to communicate that I may have given him the wrong impression of what I want by staying the night at his place the first time I'm invited back in like 4 months. I'm not into the casual hookup deal at all and while I know he's not that type of guy either, is it fair to communicate that soon after all this happened? \nThanks in advance! I typed this in sort of a rush so If you need more details Ill gladly provide! \n Edit:	want to know the best way to approach my ex about what I want this time around	387	17	relationship_advice

Recently (January) we decided to reevaluate our relationship and decided that an open relationship would be best for us since we are still very much in love, but wanted to option to see other people. The idea was to have this transitory period before he left half way around the world for study abroad for 6 months. I have never participated in the ""open"" part of our relationship and he has only once. \n He left this morning and will be gone until december. I am free (and encouraged) to see other guys. Problem is, I'm not the type of girl to just go home with some guy. And since I love my boyfriend, I have don't really have the desire to go out and meet other guys. I feel like I should give it a shot for the sake of meeting new people and see what else is out there since we've been together so long and I should experience my college years to the fullest.

So to give a little back story, I don't have many friends. I'm pretty into art, and I only have a couple friends who are too. \n My boyfriend's friend asked him if he knew anyone that was into art and he told him that I'm into art. So the guy gets in contact with me and tells me he would be interested in kicking around techniques, ideas, etc. I was down with it since I don't have many people I can do that with. \n We start talking, and it's mainly art stuff at first. Then he starts telling me about how him and his gf are having issues, and I give him any advice I could. They end up breaking up a few days later though. \n We end up hanging out to have an art night. I told my boyfriend about this and he felt kind of weird about it because he said 2 of this guy's former gf's were in a relationship when he got with them. I told him he has nothing to worry about and that since they're friends, I highly doubt this guy is going to try anything. \n Now, I have no attraction to this guy whatsoever, and only look at him as a friend, I'm completely happy with my bf. But, after we hung out that one time, he has just started talking to me a lot. I'm afraid he's gonna start liking me and try something. I almost feel as if he's trying to fill the void in his life where his gf used to be with me. \n So I just really need advice on how to go about this. He's a really nice guy and it's cool doing art shit with him, but I have no idea if I should just not hang out with him anymore to stop any possible drama or if I'm overreacting? I haven't told my boyfriend how I feel about it either. I don't want him to get pissed and call the guy out on it or anything. Should I though? Would it be best to tell my boyfriend how I feel about it? Should I tell this guy how I feel? I'm just so lost right now. I don't want anyones feelings to get hurt, but I don't want this guy to think that I can just take the place of his girlfriend whether he's intending it to be that way or not. \n Any advice will be much appreciated.

"Hi everyone. So here is the story. My boyfriend (24) and I (F 23) have been together for about 2 years. I had never been in a LTR before him, though I had a decent amount of romantic experience. I had just always been more of a FWB kind of gal, and never felt compelled enough by somebody to commit to being in a serious relationship with them. But for some reason, he was different. We are similar in a lot of ways, and he is just overall a really wonderful guy. I have always cared about him a lot. However, in the beginning of our relationship, I always felt like he was more committed than I - I did not really go through a ""honeymoon phase"", and I think he did. I felt a little suffocated at times, but we worked through it. Then there was the ""love"" problem. I have an emotional aversion to this word, and I am not 100% clear on why that is. I was very apprehensive to say this when he first did, so I didn't. I tried to explain and explain and explain how I felt no emotional connection to this word, how I would rather express my affection for him in other ways, etc., but I know it made him feel badly/upset. So fast forward to now, a year or so later. I have been working to overcome my anxiety with this word/phrase, and I told him that if he wanted to start saying it to me again, he could, and I have made an effort to begin saying it to him as well. At this point, I feel like I really was just not at a point emotionally to be so forthcoming with my emotions. I was/am an extremely slow mover. The problem is....he doesn't say it anymore. And I feel like now I am 100% in our relationship, and that he is backing away. I don't know why, when he pushed so hard for so long for me to be able to tell him I love him, that he wouldn't be jumping at the opportunity now that I feel like I'm in a place to say it regularly. He says he still feels the same, we have talked about it, I just feel like things are different and that he is more distant and blah blah blah. I've just been feeling down about the whole thing, but he denies that anything is wrong or different whenever I bring it up. It's like...I've never been a relationship person, and he is. And it scares me that now I'm in a position where I can legitimately see myself being with him for the long run, but he seems to be coming down from the high, in a matter of speak.

I'm talking the kind of cuddles where there's no sex, but he nuzzles and inhales deeply while his head is in my hair. He wanted me to come to a super private family and four friends party. Serious stuff.  \n He says  ""I don't know what I feel""  when I asked. \n He said ""I love spending time with you"" etc, and acts like it. \n I didn't say ""do you love me"" to pressure him to say that, I just asked him how he feels about me/us so I can know what to do. He knows that's why I was asking. \n \n If he was saying he loved me but not acting like it, that would be a pretty cut and dry situation to me. My thought is that if he doesn't know what he feels for me after this long, it's not enough for me. I know I love him, he knows how I feel. I just can't do the 'hang out' thing without at least knowing what he feels... And if he doesn't know I doubt that's a good sign.

"There's this girl (almost 18/F) at college with me (18/M) and I really like her. We have at least a hundred things in common, from music to weird sayings to gestures, any number of things. She told me in innocent conversation that she wasn't looking for a relationship until at least sophomore year. I have advice from a friend (18/F) to mention it to her second semester this year (our freshman year). Problem is, she might have someone she likes back at home. She denies it, but someone else says it's true (only one person, her roommate, tells me this. Everyone else I've talked to says she doesn't). \n I'm thinking of just saying something like, ""[Girl], I really like you. We have so much in common.

"I love my wife. She is the only person in this world who I want to be around with. But at times she displays passive aggressive behaviour. \n Here's how I know how she is passive aggressive: \n Sometimes we would have a small argument and then she coccoons herself. By that I mean, she would shut herself from the world. She'd sit alone in the room and not talk with me. She'd shut off her cell phone and resist talking to anyone, even her own family members. And this behaviour doesn't have to be only triggered by me. She could be having a fight with anyone else within her circle or family and it would affect the whole circle. \n She could be very stubborn. And she'd not forgive anything so easily. \n She forgets about small tasks altogeher. For example, sometimes I'd ask her to do something and she'd not do it. When I ask her about it, she'd be all ""Oh, I forgot"" and then walk away un apologetically. \n She thinks people don't want her happy. \n She would pout all day at times. \n At times she'd misconstruct a slight remark into something big and make it look like a personal assault at her or her family. \n She's not take even the smallest opinion or constructive thoughts about anything. At times she'd listen but I doubt she'd absorb. She does this to everyone and not just me. \n Oh yes, and she'd be pouty for like a day or two and then she'd start getting normal slowly. But soon enough a trigger goes off and it's back to square one. \n But... \n She can be very loving. She does small tasks for me without even me telling her. For example, I'd go back home from work and see all my shirts washed and ironed. She'd make tea without even me mentioning anything. She's start feel good topics. She'd sit and watch my favourite TV shows even though she's not a big fan or something. \n My questions: \n I love her to bits and I want her happy and not be pout-y/angry most of the times.

I am usually a pretty calm guy when it comes to jealousy but with her I can't help it.\nFirst, we have only been dating for 4 months as of today. Things have moved extremely fast. We originally met at Eharmony and the relationship just gained steam from day 1. One of the things that worry me is that that it might be moving too fast. She is very sweet to me and does all types of things for me (cooks, gets me little gifts, etc) and we are already planning to consider sharing a place in months. She has met my friends and parents and they all think she is great. We are really happy sharing time together. \n However, when I think of things I just almost feel a wave of insecurity. She has done nothing to make me think she is having any type of affair with anyone but the moment anyone flirts or gives her a look I feel myself getting pissed. I am mostly referring to basic club or bar flirting that she does not pay attention to. I come up with this borderline crazy scenarios in my head of how she can cheat on me. \n The other night she slept over I just couldn't get over it and I ended up looking through her phone. I felt terrible and I found nothing. I think part of why I think she is going to do something is because she is a very sexual person? we have a great sex life and enjoy it quite a bit. We usually spend the weekends together and have sex a few times. \n Anyways, I have never felt this way as an adult and it is pissing me off a bit. Some help/guidance would be greatly appreciated. I don't think she has done anything bad so far and I don't think its good for me to judge her in such a way.	dating girl for a few months. everything is great. can't help but think she is going to cheat on me and fear the relationship moves too fast and is not genuine. too good to be true?	321	36	relationship_advice
"I've been with my gf for about 6 months now, it's been great at the beginning, as all relationships are.\nAt some point we got to talk about what we each want to do with ourselves later in life (not in the ""us"" notion, but just as a general notion for each of us). \n I'm a really ambitious person. Currently in college & working. \n She's more relaxed about things, and likes to hang out with friends, go out to the beach etc more, and is currently working a minimum-wage, dead-end, job. She's planning on going to college ""sometime in the future"", and constantly pushes it further into the future (as well as the tests that are required to be taken to get into college (mandatory here)). \n She's also trying to get her own place, car etc (currently lives with her parents, travels by bus etc), but knows well-enough that her current (minimum wage) job won't allow her to do so. So I suggested she takes a temporary position as a secretary or something along those lines, and do a simple 9-5 job to save up some money. But she actively refused (I tried this a few times over the course of 2-3 months), saying that ""things will be fine"", and that ""[she'll] do it  somehow "". \n This really bothers me, because I see her ""standing still"" in life, not advancing anywhere, whether it be starting school, getting her own place, getting a better job, getting a car or whatever. All she does is have fun half the time and work the other half for minimum-wage that barely covers her expenses from what I understood. \n I really want the best for her, and care about her immensely, but she's making it really hard to care for her and believe in her when she doesn't even believe in herself, and all she does about advancing in life (in the cases she's not stating the above such as ""it'll be fine"") is say that she'll do better, but in reality does very little, if anything, about it. \n So, reddit, what should I do? I really care about her, but it's torturing me seeing her do nothing with her life.

The same scenario happened to me, and I strongly advise you to get out now. You staying with her won't magically prevent your GF from hurting herself.

So about a month ago, I broke up with my boyfriend after 10 months. We had had a great relationship, mature, and made sure we were there for each other, but still had our own lives and space as well. I broke up with him because he started to get distant, and I didn't panic or pull him tighter, but let him do what he needed. He kept coming back to me, but the feeling of something being off was still there, so when I asked him to talk about things, he just vanished. After a week of not hearing from him - where I refrained from reaching out as well - I broke things off. \n Anyway, I was basically devastated, but I'm an adult, and understand breakups happen. I hate the way he handled it, but I'll be fine and move on, and didn't see the point in yelling at him or bringing up things for no reason, just to alleviate my own hurt. So I didn't. \n However, last week, after weeks from not hearing from him (and not reaching out either), he texts me how much he misses me, how amazing I am, and all of the usual business. I played with the idea of not responding, but that felt like a game, and that's not what I'm about, so finally I just asked him what happened? \n He told me he liked me too much off the bat, and as I wanted to take things slow and was leery of starting relationships due to issues in my past, my reluctance hurt him. He said that he just got to a point where he couldn't handle it and that was what the distance was. Which...makes no sense to me, because, eventually, I opened up (after only a couple months of casual dating, and his persistence of wanting to be exclusive) and things were GREAT. For months. We were both open with each other, and he was well aware that I was into him and wanted to work toward a future together, so when he said that he couldn't handle it, it was months after we were honest with each other, and things had been going fantastically. Even during his distance period, he still wanted me around, and asked me to come over, and acted normal when I was with him. The texting conversation about this ended with me saying if he really wanted to be with me, he would be, end of...fear wouldn't stop him. \n He reached out to me the next day about something silly and inconsequential, but I just ignored him, because I was in a head-spin. He hasn't tried again since, and neither have I. \n So, I guess my question and the	is: after a (seemingly?) great relationship, ex got distant, and I broke up with him. After 3 weeks of not hearing from him, he reaches out to me to explain he got scared and couldn't handle his emotion. Is this ever accurate, or a cop out guys use to let the girl down gently? (Which, by the way, it doesn't! Haha) \n Thank you!	456	63	relationship_advice

This is a relatively simple situation, but it's still incredibly sticky. Basically one of my friends [16/M] broke up with aforementioned girlfriend (I'll call her Melons) a few weeks back. Melons was incredibly distraught by the entire situation, and she clearly didn't see the breakup coming. \n Fast forward to right now. Melons definitely likes my best friend (I guess he can go with Jim for now). Jim is also friends with the first boyfriend (Paul). Melons thinks Jim is incredibly sweet, cute, etc... and it seems like there's definitely some flirting going on. He likes her back. The obvious problem is that Jim and Paul want to stay friends, but Jim also wants to go out with Melons. Is there any way to accomplish this? I've seen it happen before and it ended disastrously, but I feel like there could be hope if Jim talks to Paul man to man sort of thing. This is really key. Jim might end up saying 'fuckit im going out with her' but he really doesn't want to be that guy. \n Now, for some of the thornier details. I know for a fact Melons likes Jim. He's a great guy and I don't know why he hasn't found anyone sooner. But I'm not sure how much she REALLY likes him vs she's sad after break up. I'm not good at describing this stuff, but hopefully you get it; the feeling of desperate loneliness and the lack of self worth from a breakup might drive her to seek comfort. Also, she said she missed hanging out with our group of friends. This might not sound big, but its another ulterior motive to consider. \n Now, for the other side of the coin. I don't know how much Jim actually likes her back. I've made it clear that 'just hooking up' would not be acceptable at all in this situation. See, he's a horny 16 year old boy. As a horny 16 year old boy myself, I could easily see how he might be confusing feelings up there for feelings down there.  Melons is quite attractive, especially in certain areas. He doesn't really get all that much in terms of girls (nothing at all, really - I swear he deserves a girl like this).  My general point is his penis might be taking command of the ship. However, he does think Melons is really sweet, and I think he enjoys her company.	My best friend doesn't want to be a rebound guy, but he's desperate and horny. Whatdo?	405	16	relationship_advice
I've suddenly developed a crush and it's been kind of a crazy experience. I'm normally focused on school and have never had a crush, so all of this is new and disorienting to me. Please help! \n Last night, I had dinner and hung out with a couple friends (3 girls including me + 1 guy). I am the most extroverted, so I'm used to people sort of paying a bit more attention to me in the group, but I noticed that one of my friends seemed to be paying me more attention than usual. He would look at me exclusively when he was talking, even though my friend standing next to me is far prettier, and generally seemed extra smiley or whatever. \nAnyway, throughout the night I just got a different sort of vibe from him, almost instinctive, that he liked me. \nWhen we were all playing cards together, I noticed that when someone cracked a joke, he would look at me first when everyone laughed. \nGenerally, I am never looking around at people, but one time I turned my head to laugh at something and swiveled back to find that he was staring me straight in the eyes, which made me super embarrassed so I looked away immediately. \nLater, when I had to leave early, he was looking down at the ground while everyone was telling me goodbye. \n The next morning, I was thinking about him. I didn't have a crush on him before that night, but I somehow got the vibe he liked me?? thinking about how he might like me made me realize that he's actually so wonderful. He's so kind, incredibly smart, warm, and good looking- much better looking than me. \nAll of this leads me to doubt that he actually likes me, since he's just way too good for me. Straight up. AND the fact that he didn't point his feet to me the entire night, which is apparently one of those signs of interest I learned from googling shit about crushes after realizing I had one this morning. (Do you always do the feet pointing thing? Because I realized I was definitely doing it to him.) \n UGH maybe he just thinks I'm funny and wants to be better friends. I'm cool with that too, but I'm just so confused and don't know how to person anymore. Help.	When you get the sense that someone likes you are you usually right?

(I don't know if they were drinking, but they didn't appear to be drunk when they showed up) That was fun, I only had two drinks myself and they had a few pints and then a pitcher. \n When his friend left we went back to his place and I started cooking with him, he kept hovering around me whilst I was chopping vegetables and intentionally latched onto me clumsily a few times. I asked him not to do it because I was using a knife, but he did it a few more times anyway. He asked if I wanted another drink, and I declined, and said that it was really late and we'd already had a few, and that he didn't really need another one either (as he'd been stumbling around a bit before) \n When I'd finished up, and we sat down to eat, he'd poured wine into a big tumbler (was about two normal glasses worth) and I pointed out he was already quite drunk. He then started swearing and shouting at me, and got nasty very quickly. He wasn't physically aggressive, but he was very hurtful verbally, like nothing I'd ever heard or expected from him before. \n When I pointed out I wasn't accusing him of having a problem, that my problem was that it was the first time I'd seen him all week, I hadn't spent any proper time with him that night and I had to leave early the next day because of a meeting, he just got worse. He ended up apologizing in his own way after an hour or so, but I'm still upset about it. \n I'm not a prude when it comes to drinking, I just don't like to do it to excess. I also had an abusive LTR with a guy that did get aggressive and very nasty frequently, and his drinking too much was a large part of it. I really do think the world of my current boyfriend, and I'm deeply hurt, and really shocked he acted like this. \n Should I bring this up again? Am I overreacting? I don't think I am, but I could be projecting my ex onto him. I really don't know what to do about this. \n He does tend too drink much when we go out, to the point he can't walk straight, but he's never ever been nasty like this before.	my otherwise amazing boyfriend got uncharacteristically nasty with me while drunk, how should I deal with this? \n  EDIT  I'm going to deal with this. This kind of behavior is never okay, and it needs to be addressed. Thanks guys, it's great to be able talk about out this kind of thing here, I really appreciate it. You rock!	469	58	relationship_advice
"Today is our 6th year anniversary. We are technically married, just haven't had our wedding yet. It is in 3 months. We had a huge fight last night about how she feels like I'm imprisoning her by asking her not to stay outside at late hours. She took that statement as ""you need to stay home once we are married"" So she packed her stuff and went to her parents house. Apparently, she wants to do whatever she pleases even after the wedding... I believe being married, there are some sacrifices you need to make... For ex, I don't go out late and drink with my friends because I know she's waiting at home... \n She also stated that she's not so sure about us.. she's actually been saying that alot lately... I took it as pre-wedding emotional confusion and let it slide.. even though it sickens me every time I hear it. So I told her to think hard about what she wants once she leaves.. \n So I spent our 6th year anniversary drinking all day.. I'm not sure what's happened here.. she came by this morning and we had another argument... Am I wrong by asking my wife to not go out and party once she's married? It's not like I'm saying I don't want you to ever go outside... I just don't feel safe when it's dark outside... plus, I don't want someone looking at my wife and thinking ""look at her partying, while her husband is at home"" \n I don't know what to do... I feel like maybe this won't work out... but at the same time I can't even think about explaining this to my parents if things don't go well... We've already booked a location, had our pictures taken, bought the wedding dress... having to explain to all the people around me... I just.. can't... what's worse is my parents having to explain to people around them why their son's wedding is cancelled... I can't do that to my parents.. \n Help me reddit.. what should I do?"

It was the first serious relationship either of us had been in. We were a very close couple and ended up forming a very strong bond- perhaps typical for your first relationship- spending all day with one another, just being in each other's company. Life was great! \n However, roughly 3 months into the relationship, she tells me that she's starting to develop particularly strong feelings for one of my friends (not a particularly close friend, but someone who had been in my group of friends for a long time). Obviously this was very hard to hear, and she later put it down to the fact she hadn't developed any physical attraction for me (also hard to hear...) throughout the relationship, and so this resulted in her being able to become attracted to someone else. \n We went on a 'break' for around a week, to see what it would be like as friends, and ultimately she decided that, whilst she would like to stay together, it would be best to remain friends. Obviously this resulted in us both struggling for a while. At the time of writing, I can't say I'm 100% over her (2-3 weeks after we broke up) but I was able to find comfort in the idea of us being friends. \n One thing I struggled with was the thought of her and my friend dating (hasn't happened at the time of writing, but they are becoming increasingly close- it looks inevitable). I feel like having the two of them in my friends group would be very difficult for me, likely tear me apart inside, and I'd find it difficult to remain such good friends with her. She became my best friend whilst we were together, and I can't stand the thought of losing her... \n A further complication was the other day, she came round to my house (as a friend) and things began to escalate, essentially becoming friends with benefits for the day (not a phrase I like, but it gets the message across). We never got to the stage of having sex, but the friends boundary was drastically crossed. \n Today, she approaches me with regards to what happened and tells me that it can't happen again (something I agree with). But she goes on to say she felt used- something that really hurt me, but also annoyed me. She didn't seem to understand that I never wanted things to end and so therefore still have a lot of feelings built up for her. Yet she presumably thought all I was interested in the physical action that occurred (for the record, everything was fully consensual). She goes on to say that we should distance ourselves from one another, become a lot less close than we have been. My fear is that if we become more distant, she will become closer to the guy she likes, resulting in them getting together in the near future- something I'm not yet ready for, resulting in me having to practically cut contact with her to stop it from tearing me apart. But I really don't want to lose my best friend, so how do you guys suggest I handle the situation?	My girlfriend and I broke up as she started to become attracted to my friend. We stayed really good friends but ended up way over stepping the friends boundary. Now she wants us to distance ourselves but i fear losing her altogether...	529	42	relationship_advice
"A little background: About 4 months ago I broke up with my ex of 3 years and started using OKC to find a girl who I could just meet to talk to and get my mind off the last 3 wasted years. \n So here is the situation, I met a girl about 3 weeks ago through OKC. And I honestly think I have completely fallen for her. She is literally my perfect match, and honestly I have never felt this way ever before over a girl. \n We went out on 2 dates (which went extremely well) and the 3rd was supposed to happen last Wednesday but she had a migraine. But this migraine has persisted and I haven't spoke to her since Sunday night. Before I was dating my ex, a couple of girls I was meeting used similar ""I am sick"" excuses and never talked to me again. I don't want this to be true with this girl, but is it a possibility? \n I texted her this morning to see how she was feeling and to see if she would want to go out tonight, but I shouldn't expect a reply until 12-2pm est. \n Sorry for any formatting errors, I am on my phone."

"Hey guys, \n I'll try my best to give you key info and get straight to the point here. I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for 4 years this past February. We have (kind of) a long distance relationship (I'm from NJ shes from NY). I feel like she is my best friend and I love her and her company. We share a lot of the same humor, inside jokes, etc. I've never in my life met another female that I just click with as I do with her. \n The problem I have with her is I have absolutely no idea how to solve arguments cleanly with her. 80% of the time when we argue, she turns into a brick wall of defense and it feels more like combat than actually trying to resolve anything. It feels like she has this need to be right and nobody can tell her wrong. I like to consider myself a very laid back person, but this frustrates the hell out of me and turns me into an angry person. I feel like I'm arguing with a child in most cases. The following is a list of things that may happen during the argument on her behalf: \n \n Add her own feelings to what I just said to her and make it sound like that's what I said.  \n Contradict herself and keep battling.  \n Talk in long winded sentences and jump from topic to topic.  \n Try to change the topic of conversation to one she feels she has more leverage in.  \n \n Not to mention she has pet peeves of using curse words, interrupting her when she talks and raising ones voice. Step on one of these landmines and we are in a different argument. In a lot of cases, she breaks her own rules (not the cursing though).  I am frustrated as I even write this. \n When I feel like we aren't getting anywhere in the argument, the amount of f###s I give go out of the window. The respect that she asks of me diminishes because I feel like shes so defensive and so argumentative that it seems like shes in this for war and not to resolve anything. I think that she has a problem with accepting responsibility sometimes because when I point something out that she did that started an argument in the first place, she gets so bent out of shape and shuts down because im saying ""its all her fault"". \n A little history about her: \n \n Grew up in a household where her mother basically sheltered her.  \n She doesn't have the greatest relationship with her mother and they argue pretty frequently.  \n Dad has been out of her life since she was in the 7th grade (moved to GA, but they talk on the phone every so often).  \n Stress levels are pretty high due to the environment that she lives in (her mother mostly), finances and other factors.  \n \n I'm just at a loss of what to do. The arguments can get pretty bad sometimes and it only does nothing but push me away. So much so that I feel like I want to end the relationship. When I think of a future with her, it scares the hell out of me because I don't want to spend the rest of my life arguing, frustrated, and angry. I've talked to her time and time again about these things and she says that she will ""work on them"", but its been 4 years and I still don't know if I want to spend the rest of my life with the person that I'm with right now (not saying that I'm gonna get married tomorrow or something). \n Help."

Hi all. I'm a 23 year old female. I come from a working class background, and grew up with very little money. I've recently started dating a Norwegian guy who is an investment banker. I've never gone out with someone financially well off and feel quite intimidated. He's lived all over the world for work, at the moment he's in London. At 24 he already owns several properties and earns more money per month then I do all year. I'm studying to be an accountant to better my future career prospects, but I feel like such a failure around him. In previous relationships I always pay my half, but where he takes me I can't afford to. Has anyone else out there dated someone wealthier then themselves? How do you deal with them paying for everything?	I'm poor. He's rich. I normally pay my half. Can't. Feel like a failure in life as I'm not as successful.	136	21	relationship_advice
"She's unhappy with her marriage and doesn't want to be in it anymore. \n I have $100 that says this is paraphrasing.

"The cousin and I are fairly close. I really want to get (stay) involved in this kid's life. The position is largely non-religious, but has religious prerequisites (I've been baptized, the ceremony is religious[Christ Orth]). A consortium of my parents, and both of their mothers have come up with the following advice in this order: \n \n You're not ready for this, primarily because you have not had children of your own. You should have your own children first. If your cousin really wants you to be Godfather, she'll wait. \n \n You can play the role of Godfather without actually being one. Your cousin would still give you the same access and privileges to the child as to a Godfather. Meanwhile, claiming the title may cause a slew of family politics emanating from the cousin's parents and their siblings with whom relations are somewhat rocky right now but not catastrophic. Cousin's parents have offered great support to me being the Godfather; main concern is about problems in the mid to far future. (I can say with great certainty that the ""consortium"" does not have malicious intent, i.e. trying to take away the cousin's parents favorite for Godfather) \n \n You are geographically too far away to participate enough in the child's rearing to be a Godfather (4000 miles; I visit regardless ~2/year). \n \n \n My brother (29m), my best friend, also dissented with this advice: \n \n You have a lot going on in your life. \n \n You might have kids of your own soon. \n \n You're an Uncle to my own daughter (born around same time). You should focus on hanging out with us. (1500 miles away). \n \n \n I have a steady income at a level high enough to support two people. I don't own a home or car (mainly by choice), although I do have savings of various sorts. I'm a student at night (again, while still maintaining visits to both my cousin and brother at least 2/year each). It has explicitly been stated that my senses of responsibility or morality are without question. Only the reasons above pertain as to why they're opposed. I have no reason to believe that they'd deceive me. I am not in any LTR or current flings. \n I am, of course, biased towards becoming a Godfather. Does anyone have experience with this that can support or deny any of these bullet points?"	Cousin offered role of Godfather to me; parents, grandparents, and brother/best friend advise against it.

I am living far from home, partway through my residency (post-medical school training.) I have no good friends, no family, no support here. My fiance lives in our home state, though not where we are both from. He's lived there for 2 years longer and has lots of friends, free time and support there. He is a very short plane ride away from our hometown and visits family and old friends often. \n I am not doing very well over here. I love my program and my city, but as time goes on I just can't stand being away from my fiance and my friends/family. I feel so alone, and the long hours and short daylight makes it worse. We are getting married in June, and still have a year of long-distance after that. A year and a half feels like eternity to me, just unbearable. I think about it all the time and it makes me so sad. \n On top of everything, I am gleaning less and less comfort from my fiance over this issue. He talks me through it and sometimes I do feel better afterward. But other times (and seems moreso recently), I have not been feeling great after our talks. He kind of just tries to cheer me up and tells me to try to find happiness where I am. OK advice, but it I end up feeling completely unvalidated and somehow lonelier than before. There is a huge imbalance in our respective everyday lives, and it's really hard for me. It seems he is doing just fine, obviously the distance is not ideal but he has enough support and comfort that he is able to withstand it. I am not able to withstand it and he just doesn't seem to be able to empathize. \n I have told him of my dissatisfaction with our communication, but he gets frustrated that I'm not taking his advice, or I'm not trying hard enough to be happy, or  something , I don't know. He admits that he has it better than I do right now, social support wise. I just don't feel like doing anything. I'm sleeping all the time, I'm crying a lot, and I feel so sad and lonely. He just doesn't get it. He doesn't understand why I don't feel like doing anything, like how I find cleaning my apartment to be an almost impossible task. I don't want him to tell me to be happy. I don't know what I want. I guess I want for us to be together, and I  am  looking into how I can move to where he is. But in the meantime it just hurts so much that he can't empathize. \n I don't know if I'm really looking for advice, or what. But thanks to anyone who reads this.	I'm far away from home and sad, and he's near home and happy and doesn't understand why I'm depressed or what depression is like. And it makes me feel even lonelier.	468	31	relationship_advice
I'm a third-year uni student [20/m] and a bunch of first years, a year or two younger than me, have moved into the building I live in. One of them [19/f] is cute and we have a lot of common nerdy interests such as Pokemon and Art (she's gotten me back into drawing) and it seems we get along (she gets along with a lot of people and is very friendly, I'm not the only person she talks Pokemon with). One day after we had a Pokemon battle and trade and talked about anime or something, and I was alone, another girl on campus who saw our interactions walked over and said she saw sparks between us and thinks we'd make a great couple. While I enjoyed spending time with her, I never seriously considered this an option; I have never had a real relationship; I've dated a few times and had a friend with benefits briefly, but that's it. But now that this other girl brought it up, I'm beginning to think that I may have feelings for her. \n I'm not very used to the feelings I now feel; it could be love, but it sometimes feels to me like a stalker deal, in that part of me wants her to spend time with me and go out with me. Also, I find it incredibly hard to open up to her; I've tried once or twice, but both times it seemed like she didn't understand what I meant. Because of my unfamiliarity with everything, I don't really know what I'm feeling or how to deal with it. \n Anyway, I asked if she wanted to grab lunch the next day and she agreed, but she had a sickie and didn't get my text asking if we were still on for lunch until 8.00 pm. I asked again that night in person and again she said yes, but seemed to ignore what I said and the next day, had another ate night due to drinking and slept in until well past midday. I don't want to ask again because I fear\n1) That it would be pestering her and being a nuisance, and,\n2) That she doesn't want to go out with me since she isn't offering to reschedule or apoligising (or forgetting due to drinking or something) \n I enjoy spending time with her, and she engages in conversation with me and seems honest and genuine about it, but I don't know if she would ever consider feeling the feelings I now feel, or if she does and is nervous too (unlikely...). I don't know if I should ask her out again over text or facebook message, or if I should give up and stay as friends. Another part of me feels that if I reveal to her how I feel, it could cost me our friendship and the mutual friends we have and cause me massive embarrassment.

"My exgf and I dated for about a year and a half and broke up this past July. We had a great relationship and were on the path of taking our relationship to the next level. I've had longer relationships before but had never felt this way about someone before. For the first time in my life I felt like I could see myself marrying this girl and spending the rest of my life with her. \n We had leases that were ending around the same time and decided to move in together. We had arguments while we were dating but nothing serious. The odd thing is that soon after making the decision to live together (her idea initially) whenever we went out drinking we would have a huge blown up argument about nothing. Literally the next day we'd be like ""what are we even fighting over?"" \n All these nothing fights happened over the course of a month while we were looking for an apartment. We found one that we agreed on and were going to sign the lease. The morning that we were going to sign it she said she didn't think living together was a good idea. She didn't want to break up but didn't want to get into a lease with me either. I was beyond upset by this (I had always thought even though we had been fighting our relationship was really strong).

I didn't go there with expectations, but I left hopeful that I would get her back. Fast forward to this week we hung out again. This time was totally different. She was very quiet and distant. I made a move to be closer to her and she didn't respond like she had last week.\nWhat do I do now? Should I keep trying to initiate spending time with her? Or should I focus on letting her go?

Hi all, \n I'm recently 18, and my current boyfriend of 10 months is my first real boyfriend, and the first guy I've had sex with. I'm happy with him and he treats me right, but there's a little part of me that wants to know how green the grass is elsewhere. I was homeschooled, so have some issues socially sometimes. \n I don't want my current boyfriend to be the only guy I've ever had sex with, and there's an attractive guy(23) in my class who keeps flirting with me. I would really like to stop just blushing when he says things or checks me out and make a real move, but I don't want to cheat on my boyfriend. My classmate is hardly a compatible person for a relationship, but I would be more than willing to spend a night or two with him. \n To further complicate things, I've recently met a guy(20?) with a very similar background to my own who understands some key issues I've never really been able to connect with anyone else over (ADHD, similar thoughts on religion, and early loss of a parent, if it's relevant).

We've been dating for 7 months, knowing that she had depression and still in 'recovery' stage. She is a quiet, formal and serious person while i'm playful and love to crack jokes. \n During stressful periods (examinations), she is more prone to bouts of depression. Usually triggered by tiffs and squabbles between us( sometimes due to different personalities) and petty social problems brought about by her friends which we should have no problem in getting over them. Instead, things would escalate. \n 1) She wouldn't be able to focus on studying. Instead, she would lie on bed all day long and sleep.\n2) She couldn't give affection and would lash out on me.\n3) Sometimes, she would say that our relationship have no chance and that she is not suitable to have relationships.\n4) Usually she requests me to leave her alone, would tell me that she's going to cut contact with me (she always resume contact after a few hours or a day).\n5) She tells me that she dislikes me ( it escalates to saying that she hates me when she gets angry). \n I am also not free from fault, unknowingly doing things to upset her and getting on her nerves somehow as she have low tolerance. \n This relationship is draining me physically as well as emotionally.

We've been together for 2 years, she is my best friend and I love her to bits, this is our second year of the college, the first was a struggle, but we made it. After that year was over I felt free like I had finished and we could be together again, but summer only lasts a few months now were back at it. Before school things were great, and now everything is falling apart. I don't want to be in school, in fact I never wanted to be here I don't really like it too much, and would much rather be at home with her. But that is not an option. I spent all of last year trying to find a way so we could at least be together. I move there, she moves here, we both move home, but she's pretty set where she is, and I think it would be in my best interests academically to just stay where I am, and finish out school. I feel like being in a relationship has made it harder for me to enjoy college, for multiple reasons. If we are together, college will never be the better of the two, and every year it will be a struggle coming back because that just means 9 months away again. I don't think being apart would make college much better, but who knows. I do think it would make leaving for college easier, and I think I could try and be more social and focus on making friends and improving the relationships I have up here a bit, try and enjoy it, instead of counting down the days til I get to go home. Anyways over the last week she visited and we talked, and I brought up the idea of taking a break, just, to try and see if being on our own would maybe make things easier, and it escalated. I was hoping for a consensual decision or something, where we agree on what we wanna do and even though its hard we are both interested in trying something new. But that is not the case. I would be breaking up with her, permanently and I don't how prepared I am to do that. Anyways I would like to move on, and at least try to make it on my own and make it easier, but I don't think I can. I still love her more than anything, and have been crying constantly for the past few days, I feel like my life has been just flipped upside down again,  I have been going through a lot of other stuff  as well. I don't have any close friends here or back home who I can really talk to about it, she is the person I always talk to about things. I also can't help but feel like a horrible person for putting her through this, its been really hard. Anyways I mostly just wanted to vent, anyones advice would be appreciated.

As the title says, I'm starting to wonder if maybe my gf and I are not very compatible people. \n I am becoming frustrated with our mismatched libidos (I have a very high libido and she is probably about average). We have sex 0-4 times a week, with it usually being about 1-2. We used to have sex daily or very close to it; this is the frequency I prefer. \n We are busy but it seems that the lesser frequency does not bother her like it does me. I don't whine about it to her but it does wear on me to see that she is not too active in pursuing me for sex. I've told her in the past that our frequency was a little low for me and we have worked on it but it still seems inadequate to me. \n My question is what else are relationships usually built on? I don't really know what is great about our relationship\u2026 We love each other and I really enjoy spending alone time with her/having sex but is that all its about? I basically don't know if there is enough going in the relationship to compensate for the less than desired sex frequency.

This morning he woke up late and had to drive to work instead of taking the train, like he had planned. He got out of the shower and saw he did not have any more of the work t-shirts he uses under his chefs coat hanging in the closet. He wakes me up and starts storming around and cursing about how I didn't wash his shirts or tell him about it. I have been working, taking care of my three small kids and studying for finals next week and it honestly slipped my mind. I have a diagnosed memory condition and when I am under stress I forget pertinent information. It sucks. \n Anyway, I offered him an alternative, a light colored t-shit I had not put away yet. It was in a basket in our sons room. He goes in there, grabs the basket, dumps it on our bed, throws the basket against the wall, wakes all the kids up. Once he finds the shirt he was looking for, he tells me it is sour, tells me to smell it and throws it on my face. He stormed around some more and yelled bye at me. I didn't respond so he said it again. I answered and he walked out the door and left. \n All the kids woke up an hour early and saw him acting like an asshole to me. I don't even feel like texting him or confronting him. Asshole morning behavior is not new from him but it just came out of nowhere. He has not had work shirts before and didn't start throwing shit because of it...and last night everything was fine. I turned him down for sex but shit, we have been married for 6 years and we do it often. He can handle being turned down every once in a while. He is exhausted and has been working insane hours...maybe that is it. I don't know, I just do know I do not want to contribute or make things worse when he acts like this. And, I don't want him to try to blame me for his behavior since its my fault I didn't wash his shirts. \n Usually he is very caring and nice to me but in the morning, jesus. I can't stand dealing with him in the mornings. He has always been like that, his mom tells me horror stories of his bad morning behavior from his teen years. It is so bad that I did not have him wake up to help me feed 2 out of 3 of our kids in the middle of the night after they were each born. It's like, it just is not worth the fight and I may as well do it myself. After years of his crap, I am not even sure it is all intentional or he is just sleep asshole-ing (ha!) or something. Anyway, anyone else have an SO who has a bad morning attitude? How do you deal?	My husband is an ass hole in the morning and I am not sure how to proceed without causing a fight.	497	21	relationship_advice
I have been dating my boyfriend for a little over a year (he's 23, I'm 24.) Overall, we have a very good relationship. We both love each other and we both think that we have a future (we'll vaguely talk about moving in together, being married, but we're in no rush). \n My biggest complaint is that my boyfriend is never enthusiastic to hang out with me. I always initiate the hangouts. A lot of the time he'll say 'maybe' but then he'll agree later on. I sometimes feel like I'm forcing him to hang out with me. When we do hang out though, we always have fun and he's affectionate toward me. When we're not together, we're usually talking online for usually a couple hours everyday. \n When I play hard to get, he is more aggressive about hanging out. Unfortunately, I don't have the patience to do this consistently. I have a very weird schedule (I tutor people in the evenings and weekends), so I need to plan in advance. He also lives almost an hour away, so I like to know ahead of time if I'll be making that trip at night (I live with my parents, so I go over to his apartment). I feel like at this stage in our relationship, I shouldn't have to play hard to get for him to want to see me. \n Our relationship wasn't always like this. He graduated in May, and started a job immediately after. He also moved to a much more boring and smaller town. Since this change in his life, he's been noticeably less enthusiastic. He also doesn't really have many friends in the area, so I'm the only person he hangs out with (other than his family). On one hand, I think that he should be even more excited to see me, since his life is more boring now. \n I am thinking there are either two things going on. 1) He's depressed with his new life and this is making him so apathetic about everything. 2) He doesn't love me anymore, but is too apathetic about changing anything. \n To support option 1, we've been talking about moving to a large city over the summer. It seems like it is possible and I really want to do it. He seems into it too. \n Anyway, has anyone been in a similar situation? Does anyone have advice for me?	BF is always unenthusiastic to hang out with me. When we are spending time together, he is enthusiastic though.	399	19	relationship_advice
It obviously bothers me as everywhere I've read and everything I've experienced indicates this is a huge red flag. I've already brought it up that she mentions him too much and she said she just wants to be honest with what's on her mind. I explained i appreciate her honesty and openness but the problem that he's still on her mind that much I fear will jeopardize our relationship.  I'm not flawless either, in the past I've gotten more upset at minor things and I'm a very territorial alpha.

"Her and I have been dating for eight months now and it's been a very turbulent eight months. About every other week, she gets upset at something dumb and acts like she wants to end our relationship, wants nothing to do with me and basically points out every little thing she doesn't like about me. Then after this cycle, she tells me she's in love with me, and everything is great for a week, and we repeat the cycle. \n When we're in a low, she'll either say something like ""I don't believe we are compatible"" or she will say something like ""I'm not mature enough for a real relationship"" or ""I think I just want to be single"". Then all of the sudden we have a few really good days and she loves me again. Now the things we have been having issues with have been really small things, or bad communication, but this seems to be endless, and I feel on edge like I'm about to lose her every time something goes wrong. \n Now, normally I would have called it quits long ago, however we are very good together, have a lot of fun together, tons of similar interests, views and have an otherwise very healthy relationship, and I do believe we are compatible in the long term if this roller coaster doesn't result on her bailing on me.

I've been dating this girl for a little over a month now. It's the first relationship I've ever really been in, and I've wanted to be in one for a long time now. I really want to like her, because objectively she has all the good qualities I could reasonably ask for in a significant other, and when I can get over these problems I'm having, I do like her. The problem is that, like it says in the title, I'm not quite feeling it. The feeling has been coming in and out since after a week or so, but it's been ramping up this week, especially after we finally had sex this past friday (my first time, but not hers). I really don't know if it's just that I'm not quite ready to be in a relationship, I'm scared it won't work out, I'm kind of emotionally stunted due to issues I've had, or maybe I'm just one of those poor bastards who just wants something until they have it. I would greatly appreciate the input of anyone who's been in similar situations, and I'll be happy to answer any questions anyone has for me about the situation.	been dating a girl for over a month, not been feeling it on and off despite her being pretty great	199	20	relationship_advice
I(20M) came to college a few months ago, and while I was initially worried I wouldn't make very many friends, I fit in quite nicely. In particular, I made very good friends with one girl(20F). We've got great chemistry in whatever we do, but she had a boyfriend so I was content with just being friends with her for a while. Even while she had a boyfriend, we flirted a lot together. \n So skip forward a few months to now. We're still flirting pretty heavily, but we refuse to go past that. However, suddenly she just breaks up with her boyfriend of 4 years and starts dating this douche. There was a point where she thought this guy had seriously betrayed her and hurt her, and I was there for her then, too. We got extraordinarily close then, and my new intentions became clear through my actions. \n Well, it turns out that he got back to school last night with some bullshit story and she ate it up like candy. I'm still very much infatuated with her, but she seems to have taken me down a few steps since then. \n I wish so very much that I could just go back to being friends with her, but I really don't approve of the guy she's soon-to-be-dating. That, coupled with the fact that I like her a lot now, are making this a lot more difficult than I think it has to be. I think I'm going to talk to her tomorrow and tell her than I don't think we should be friends anymore, but I don't know how she'll take that and I care about her a whole lot.

"I just need a neutral opinion on this one please...I haven't been in a relationship in a long time now and we've only been dating a couple of months so everything should still be new and fresh and lovely but...well, I'm not sure about how much my boyfriend really wants to be with me. He tells me he likes spending time with me, he misses me yadda yadda but those are just words to me. Actions count. \n Now we only see each other once a week and then mostly once on the weekends where he stays overnight. He has his own apartment but visits home quite frequently claiming there is stuff he has to do there (his parents are together still so technically theres a man around the house you know). But I mean, fine, he cares about his family and that is nice and I should respect that... \n But I still find it weird that, given we're supposed to be in love and all (which at least I am) he still goes there every or every second weekend...when we meet during the week he shows up late so we can't really do anything than have dinner and go to bed...we both have to get up early so there's no talking or whatever til midnight you know. \n So I don't wanna be the needy girflriend, but this weekend he came late on saturday, we had to go somewhere and then yesterday we were sorta hangover (he more than me) and he slept most of the day...I mean maybe he just needed to rest as he had a busy week but still... \n He also told me he would be busy on Valentines Day as ""he forgot"" that it is Valentines Day...now I'm not the kind of girl who needs flowers and chocolate and shit, but I really wanted to spend the day together since we haven't seen each other much lately and now he's going to be away Friday thru Sunday...I know he'd show up late on Sunday only to go to bed and then leave Monday and while I'm not pissed or anything, I'm wondering if I'm too needy? I told him I really wanna see him but he has planned to do something on Saturday which will require the whole day and it needs to be done at a place that is only open on Saturday so I kinda get that...still..he didn't even ask me if I wanted to come with him - when I asked he said yes of course but...why wouldn't he ask me if I already told him I'm kind of sour because he will spend the weekend away from me...again...like the one before last one where he also came late on a friday and left early on a saturday to go home... \n I'm just confused. He says he loves spending time with me and everything and generally is very sweet and supportive and the whole real deal - it just seems weird to me. \n Also, if I told him I couldn't make it on a day during the week or would spend the whole weekend away he'd gladly accept that and be happy he has some time to his own which I think is just not how it's supposed to be when you're in love? I mean I don't expect him to be totally desperate and lost when I'm gone but the fact that he takes it so ""easily"" when we can't see each other really bugs me... \n So am I just a crazy woman or could he put a little more effort in it all?"

Hi reddit. \n I have been in a relationship with my friend of eight years, for nine months now. We get along great, but hell, we were friends for so long- a relationship would be AWESOME. Or that's what we thought. \n Right now, there's nothing inherently wrong with our relationship. I still love being around him and he's a sweetie, but we just don't match. I would feel kind of sad if I lost him, but there's just some things that clash in our personalities. I really value it when someone is a little spontaneous and does something for someone else completely selflessly. Doing stuff like that is love for me. He doesn't get that (probably because he's got Asperger's) and he's told me that before. I do most of the household, because he only does stuff if asked, not on his own accord. \n He also has a really bad depression and anxiety issue, and I just don't know if I can handle that. Even though I do feel bad for him. Right now we live 'around' each other, but not 'with' each other. \n On the other side: I feel really at ease with him, and I trust him fully. We've had some fights about this, but we're at ease now. I just thought of my marriage... and kids... and I just can't see that with him. I just want someone who thinks of putting an arm around me when I'm cold every once in a while, on their own accord. I've never really had that in this relationship. We've never really did any effort on 'dates'. He's really affectionate though and I love that, it's really sweet. \n I do really get sad at the thought of losing him and I wish him all the best. I'd love to remain friends and I know that might be a hard thing later, which makes me dreadfully sad. I think seeing him with another girl would still make me a little sad. \n I know I'm not the greatest girlfriend for him either. There's things in my personality and way of living that doesn't work with his. And the same goes for his personality with me. At least, not if you want to have a family and raise kids together. \n I just wish I could carefully break up with him, and then immediately be there as his best friend again to help him through it. \n We just work as best friends, but I don't know if a romantic, dependent on each other as a COUPLE relationship was the best thing for us. I just can't explain it. \n What do you think I should do reddit? Should I break up with him? How should I tell him? I can either try to tell him, let him read this post, or read this post to him... How do I let him know my intentions? How do I hurt him the least? Am I still in love but am I just confused? \n I don't know what I'm feeling. This is my first relationship and... I can't really explain my reasons for feeling this way, it's just a feeling I have. I also really feel sad about not being around him anymore as much, I'd feel SO sad about ending it now, but I think if I keep this up we'll have a future of tiny annoyances that are always going to irk me in some way. \n If you think I should break up: He starts a supermarket job on monday after a long streak of being jobless... I do want to wait with it until after that... have his first day at least. Is that acceptable? \n Help me askwomenadvice, I'm at my end :(	I think my boyfriend and I aren't really compatible, but I still love him so much and really wish him all the best...

We often have deeper discussions with one another than we do with anyone else here. I know that were she to be interested I would start a relationship with her but I just can't tell. I haven't asked directly because I really love our friendship right now and I fear that it may go by the wayside/she'll feel awkward if the feelings aren't mutual. What are some signs I can look for to see if she is truly into me? Should I just say to hell with it and ask her?

"So I'm [16/M] and I went round to a girls house, [14/F] who I absolutely adore.

But we then went to watch civil war. Her friend came along which I didn't mind and we sat and watched the film. \nThroughout the entire thing she was really happy and everything seemed normal, she was laughing whispering to me funny things in the cinema making references to other stuff...

I stayed until the end of the credits to see if there was another secret ending, I then got a text from the person I like saying that, ""we had to leave to get home"", it was at this point I realised I still had her hat that she left at the cinema, I texted back ""I still have your hat, you left it"" to which she then replies \n""Oh shit we can so something next weekend and you can gibe it back""\n(The text has some spelling errors as that is what she sent me)\nSo I rushed out the cinema and they weren't there they had gone despite saying they would wait.

With all her friends, and my friends, watching. \n The thing is, I was fairly intoxicated, she was too, so I don't remember it as being the best kiss or anything. The kissing ended quite quickly, when one of my wingmen, by accident, dances into us so she falls, and I fall on top of her, knee first right into her inner thigh (Note: it felt as if i hit her on the way down, but i'm not completely sure). I helped her up, as i had done the other times we had both fallen, but the other times i don't think i landed on her. She after this proceeds to walk away, without a word. All her friends followed her away. She didn't look angry or anything, she just kinda smiled and left. \n Even though I don't remember the kissing as being ""good"", for us to actually go at it for 45min+ it has had to be sort of enjoyable, and since the party, I've had this thought lingering if I should add her on FB and write to her, maybe apologizing and getting to know her.\nI asked my usual wingmen what they think, one of them, the ""player"" of the bunch, told me to just forget her and move on to a new girl instead. The more romantic guy told me to add her, and that he thought i should talk to her and maybe even ask her out. I'm fairly certain she's a year older than me, but she might be 18 like me. \n I really don't know if I find her attractive, since her facebook pics are all low res and i rarely see her, and if i do it's from a distance. Drunk me of course cannot remember how she looked when we were dancing.\nShould I add on Facebook and write to her? Note that i don't really know her, just her name and the names of some of her friends"	Danced with a girl from my school at a party, made out with her in the middle of dancefloor for a good 45min+, don't recall if i think she's attractive and i'm uncertain if the kissing was good.

"My friend and I have been talking over skype (for the past couple months and now). At first, they were small conversations; 30 min - x Hours around twice a week. Recently she told me ""[Insert Name], I can't take it anymore! It feels like I have to talk to you everyday! Ahha!"" We then skype usually for 2 hours+. We're pretty open about stuff; (e.g Personal things) She keeps a journal to herself and writes (she hasn't let ANYONE see anything in her Journal even her bestfriends except for me), she usually shares everything but she wouldn't tell me one thing. She was hinting it. I asked her what its about she replied ""A boy"" and I then asked if it's a boy she talks to often (Im pretty damn sure it's me. She told me she doesnt talk to too many boys.) and she says yes. I then ask when can you tell me? ""In a couple of years when I don't feel as embarassed"" (She has told me waaay more embarassing things) she replied.

I am a male, 22, and I have been in a relationship with a girl I go to school with who is 19.  We have been together for over two months.  My girlfriend was raped by someone she thought was a friend a few weeks before we started seeing eachother.  I think they had a relationship in the past, and on her birthday, she saw him, and didn't want to have sex with him, and he forced her.    It is so difficult for her to talk about, and she doesn't talk to him anymore.  He justifies it by saying he was drunk and cares about her etc.  He used to text her all the time, and she didn't respond, until finally i took her phone and told him to leave her alone.  Whenever she sees he texted or called she gets so broken up. \n I can't believe she even trusts me, but she does.  I hope in time she will be fine, as this happened a few weeks before we got together.  She isn't much of a sharer, but she has told me a bit about what happened.  I don't want to push her into anything, and she is overall a very sensitive person.  What should I do?  Even if I never ask her to tell me, would that be better?  I want to do anything to help, but she very understandably doesn't like talking about it.  I'm very comfortable with her, and all i want to do is make her feel better and hug her so tight that she knows she's safe forever. \n I really love her, and I want to be the best I can be for her.  If anyone has any experience or any advice about how you feel, please help me understand.  I know every situation is different.  I know it will take a lot of time, but I want to be as good a support system as I can be.  (we live together, but she was out of town last weekend and ran into the guy, who I am sure tried to talk to her.  I don't know what I would do if she says she forgives him, because she seems to want to forget about it all, and he seems like the kind of rapist who won't stop until she appologizes to him.)

I(m/33) like this girl(f/25) I work with.  I have told her, she knows I want to start things with her.  It came at an inopportune time as she was married when I really knew I liked her and told her.  We hung out some together, got lunch alone for a couple of months, and were talking a lot.  She was already unhappy in her marriage, cheated on the guy with another guy(not me), and finally divorced after a long period of arguments with the husband.  She never told me she wasn't interested, seemed like she was when we could hang, and then found out after she and said she was going to try and get through some issues the ex caused her that she was dating the guy with whom she cheated on the ex.  I know we have a bunch in common( interests and life goals), 90% of the time I can make her smile and/or laugh, and we genuinely seem to have a good time doing things together.  I did the whole why not me thing and am over that.  I know that I'm not what she wants and I accept that I cannot change that no matter how much I think we would be great for each other.  What I want to understand is if you do have that much in common, you generally enjoy the persons company, and they happen to be of your sexual preference, why would you still not want to try with them and see if things can develop between the two of you?(I know plenty of relationships where there is no attraction between the two and then after some time figure out they were great for each other.Also sorry that got long winded.)

Here's some background and then I'd love to get some women's take on this. I feel like I'm making a big decision and need some help. \n Short story is, I've always been kind of a loner and found it hard to make friends. I think I'm a decent person but breaking the ice is hard for me. I was determined to do something about it and I saw all the popular girls had something in common. They all dressed a certain way (trendy, revealing clothes) and acted a certain way (flirty, sexual). \n Up to recently I had never done more sexually than a few kisses. I didn't really have any hangups about anything, it just never happened. And my clothes were all really boring and big and not flattering. \n So I spent a bunch of money on new clothes and started acting all flirty like other girls do and everything seemed to change. People treated me better, talked to me, everything turned around almost instantly. I got invited to parties and guys started paying lots of attention to me. Everything is great but it just took off a little fast. In the last few months, I've gone from total virgin to sex with 3 guys, plus some blowjobs and some more minor stuff (texted some sexy clothed pics, kissed some girls at a party, some handjobs, and some making out) \n It's been a lot of fun and I'm staying safe and life is great at school now, but my mother is getting really worried about me. She sees how I dress and she knows about at least one time I had sex (she found the condom in my room. oops.) and knows Im spending more time with guys. She wants me to stop and not have sex till I'm 18 but honestly, that's never going to happen. She says I'm going to ruin my life and catch every disease and never learn how to love anyone but I think that's all crazy. Personally I dont see any reason to stop now. My dad is ok with it and says it's all pretty normal stuff for a girl my age to be doing but my mom is losing it. \n So	I want your help. Is being sexually active and even having sex with guys I'm not dating really going to mess me up somehow?	369	24	askwomenadvice
I dont mean to make this sound like im some sort of oblivious or stupid guy.and, I consider myself to be a pretty good person,but I am also a bit introverted unfortunately. \n I totally understand women are people and are just like men in alot of ways. However, I find it hard to talk to and approach ladies often. Once a natural conversation starts, I am totally fine and could talk for a long time. They dont necessarily have to be attractive, but that does make it a bit hard too. \n I definitely am confident enough to talk to people and look at them, however, I dont really know how to approach ladies and talk to them in a social setting and get a conversation going. I have heard maybe to compliment something you like about them and then talk to them. Dont know any other ways really. I find well..that is socializing, but its hard for me to talk to ladies in alot of social settings not because im a misogynist or anti social, but because I might be hesitant or dont know what to do or say	Need advice on approaching and making conversation with women, I find it a bit hard to do. \n EDIT:As said, I get women are just the same as men when it comes to approaching and talking to them.

My girlfriend has been making it very obvious that she loves me and I believe she's doing it deliberately to see if I too feel the same, she also keeps throwing in hint's that she want's to say it. I've had other girls say 'I love you' to me before and the build up to it is near enough the same. However I am fully aware that I might be wrong. We've been dating for some time and are just mental for each other, I honestly think she's too good to me and I know that I've never been more happy in a relationship with someone than I am right now. \n I should say that I do have horrendous commitment issues however thanks to her, I'm passing it, she knows I have these issues and does her best not to 'scare me off', I've told her I'm not going anywhere. However currently I don't love her just yet, I unfortunately don't, I've been in love before and you just know when you love someone, I do care for her an awful lot and don't know how I'd cope if I lost her.

So I ask you, reddit, if she does say she loves me how do I say I don't love you back without hurting her or making her hate me, do I have to face the fact that I will hurt her, should I lie to her, will she be ok if i'm honest?

"Hello. \n First of all, I just want to say that I know that the title and the situation seems almost impossible to fix. I know that, and I'm not really looking for confirmation that the relationship is doomed. All I'm looking for is advise on how to best proceed (within the next week) to give it its best possible shot of being repaired. \n So, I've been together with this girl for over a year, and six months ago I had to move away for a new job. Everything had been going well, we were only a 1 hour flight away from each other, spoke on the phone 1-3 times a day and saw each other a couple of times a month. \n We have an amazing chemistry, but there have been some issues though. I've sometimes been a bit needy I feel - partly because of the distance - and the sex hasn't always been great. I haven't felt like I could dominate her in bed, and I've felt like she's had the upper hand in many situations. \n The weekend two weeks ago I was visiting my girlfriend. Before that weekend everything was good, we laughed on the phone and said we loved each other. However, we ended up going out together Saturday evening. Everything was good, but then I became way too wasted and acted like an absolute fool saying stupid things I didn't mean. I don't remember completely, but I remember three things: One thing about lack of oral sex, one thing about she being busy in March and one thing about an event that happened over a year ago. Might be more, but I cannot remember. None of it meant anything, I've apologised and killed that drunk side of me for good. \n The remaining days I stayed there after that evening I felt completely emasculated and tried everything to make it up to her. Could just as well been a dog or a monkey. \n After I left, she has said that she have major doubts, but that there are so many good things. And I have been a great boyfriend in many, many aspects. But she needs space and time to think about it. \n So I haven't heard from her - except a few cold texts here and there - for about 10 days now. Bought her flowers on Valentine's Day, but have also given her space. We used to talk every single day. She has an exam Monday in 5 days, and I suspect that she won't be in contact before that because she needs to focus. \n So what's my best option? I'm really struggling with the balance of ""fighting for her"" and ""giving her space"". \n \n Send a text and say good luck with studying and the exam, and that we need to talk after it is done? \n \n Continue giving her 100% space and hope that she will be in contact after the exam? I won't like us to become too familiarised with being without contact though. Two weeks is a lot in a relationship. \n \n \n I feel like she's very uncertain - and that she might be distancing herself to make things easier for the both of us. Also she owes me like $3000 which I suppose she also thinks about as she has no money atm. I also keep worrying that there's another guy in the picture, but I have no idea. \n Thanks for any advise :)"	I fucked up the best thing I have in life whilst drunk, now my girlfriend won't talk to me and I don't know if I should fight or give her space.	571	31	askwomenadvice

"Hi experienced women, \n I've been in an unofficial relationship with a guy older than me by 13 years for about 2 years. I have never committed to him in any way, and he knows that I see our relationship as unsustainable. Yet, he seems to love me unconditionally, but for no particular reason, at least to me. I'm beginning to feel like I need to buckle down with life, and give the future a chance. Maybe if he doesn't make me happy, somebody else will. Or am I the problem? \n \n Me: I am aromantic and asexual. He became my ""first"" by working really hard to befriend and seduce me in a way that I approved. So... attraction was definitely cultivated by him (altho I do like his height and body-type), and I would not have gotten close with him if he didn't work so hard for me. This makes me fear that maybe I need to be with someone who is willing to throw his love to the wind, since I am not relationship-oriented, at all. I don't know what I want or what type of relationship makes me happy, and I'm not sure if it's possible for me to be happy in a relationship because I might have unreasonable expectations and ideals, of someone who challenges, excites, and inspires me intellectually, makes me see possibilities, etc. Also, I'm probably 100% introverted. I'm low-energy, will likely not be a good provider, am not ambitious, am selfish... basically, I don't consider myself a catch by any means, though I do think I'm relatively pretty/cute. I'm an ISFP. \n \n Him: He's very relationship oriented, accepts me for who I am completely, and he's very sexually attracted to me (I do appreciate this to the extent that it makes me feel loved and wanted, but he wants sex more than I care for). He doesn't know my love language, so he uses all of them to try to communicate how much he loves me. He's really into boardgames and RPG games, and that's kind of where he puts his energy/time/money. He's not ambitious and I don't see a financially stable future with him, we would likely need to live frugally in order to make ends meet. This sounds tiresome because I lived my wholeee liffeeee being concerned about money, and I don't want to do that forever. But because I know him so well, I do find him attractive in a sweet and playful way... we have a lot of fun together. We're basically two kids when we are together, life is la-la land, with no direction. He is also an ISFP. \n \n \n Given what I've said, do any of you have thoughts, advice, suggestions? Anything!!  I think I view life as a mission/test/project, whereas he views life as a ""gift"" to just enjoy and be happy with someone you love. I feel like that's too simple, but... maybe if I ended up with someone more ambitious, he would see me as simple and lazy (in comparison), and be put off by my asexual nature.  Has anybody else had to make similar judgement calls in their life? Please ask questions if it helps you help me better.  :O I think I complicate things, or it's just a complicated/messy situation"	We're not completely compatible, we treat life differently, but he loves me and won't ever leave.

We think my dad is a narcissist (but that's a topic for another day) so you can guess she's been through a lot.\nWe have gotten her a lot of help at our local women's shelter/abused centre. She's had 24 weeks of counselling so far and has just started with a therapist. She's made incredible improvements but she's hitting a wall I think because there is one part she can't figure out and is very much stuck on. \n During my parents relationship my father withheld sex from her for probably 20+ years among other things. She was broken down completely and in many ways made to ""feel like a man."" (her words) I believe the sex only that occurred was in the creation of me... What my mom is looking for is someone to help her figure out her sexuality but it doesn't seem like her therapist can help her with that. \n Obviously because of her age, sexual education was extremely limited in school and she is struggling understanding her gender and sexuality as it's essentially been stolen from her.

Now, the other day I had my hand in between her breasts and started to explore a bit, when she said to me ""Wtf don't you ever make the first move?, we havent even made out yet"" - Now I was embarrassed coz it was true! We had NEVER MADE OUT PRIOR TO THIS. Probably 5min later, I went in for the make out and we did till we clashed teeth and she pulled out, it got even more awkward. I'm not sure if she's experienced with it since she's never really had a bf before, but we both went for it too hard and too quickly. I've always hooked up with girls within the first few dates in the past, but this girl seemed different to what I'm use to, she's never fake and keeps shit real. \n When we talk, we always have fun, make sex jokes etc, but since meeting her she's always called me a ""fuckboy"" and I guess earlier on I felt as though she may have been fucked over in the past by one. Hence, why I might of made the effort to avoid making out with her to prove I wasn't this fuckboy. \n Now along the way, I feel as though I just totally forgot that we had never ever hooked up, and swear was passed that 'point' - already thinking about having sex with this girl. Only then did I realise why she wanted to get in the backseat of the car all those times.... I feel so embarassed for not even making a move out of all those times. \n She suggested we go to pub next time we meet, to iron out the awkwardness, but I guess what I'm asking is how the do I keep her attracted to me when she probably thinks im soft and unmanly"	I feel like so unmanly and soft, how do I make it up to her and show her I'm not - apart from just making out with her?	400	28	askwomenadvice

She got self conscious and depressed about it, and that little more became a lot more. \n I find myself lately becoming less physically attracted to her, and I absolutely hate it because we have such a great emotional and intellectual relationship outside of just the physical. \n =="	The point of my question being, what can I do or better yet, how do I approach the batter of weightless without being hurtful?	197	24	askwomenadvice
"Hello, \n About me: I'm a 33 year old man who has never really dated. I've always had girlfriends (usually long-term relationships 2, 3, 4 years) but those girls all sought my attention on their own (not that I'm anything particularly special). It's been 2 years since my last relationship and so I've started, for the first time, trying to seek companionship on my own. I'm a bit of an introvert / intellectual so bars and certainly clubs aren't quite my thing. I've tried the online thing but seems a waste of time. \n Q1:   Where are some places / what are some ways you might suggest a guy my age find / approach a girl?  Just any general tips would help. \n Q2 :  Some of what I've seen about dating in the media, and I know everyone is different, is that you ""need to wait 3 days in between contacts"", ""don't be too available"", ""don't be too nice"", etc. Any general tips in that way? \n So I did meet a girl on a dating app. We've met 3 times in last 3 weeks and we get along great. I have no idea how to make it intimate (not that I necessarily want/need to so quickly) so I've just been trying to follow her vibe, to let her lead. However, I do worry that things might be moving too slow for her. I can never gauge her interest.  I did ask her about it and she's said things that could maybe be taken as a roundabout way of letting me go, ranging from ""I'm attracted to you physically but I don't know enough about you to have romantic feelings"" and ""I think we could be great buddies"".  I'm a big believer in being vulnerable and open so I've pretty much been as direct as I could be about my hopes and fears, but she's never returned the courtesy, she doesn't seem to ask questions about me, that sort of thing.  It's starting to feel like I'm probably coming on too strong, maybe. \n Q3:   Any suggestions on how to gauge and/or get her interest? \n Q4 :  What do you make of this, our last interaction on chat? \n Me: What do you think about X? \n Her: I dunno, what do you think? \n Me: I think Y about X. \n Her: I'm on too many painkillers right now to write out a thesis. \n Me: Oh no, how come? \n Her: Long story \n Me: OK. \n No more correspondence for 24hrs"	Am I wrong to assume she's rather not interested? Any suggestions? \n Thank you.	412	13	askwomenadvice

I was sitting and eating breakfast at school. I finished and was about to leave and then saw two guys I know. Well I said ill wait for ya and then waited. I got up and saw them over somewhere else. I thought where could they have gone \n I saw them sitting with a couple of girls and guys. Well, I knew all of them. One of the girls I know well and we have been friends for a couple of years. We all talked and 1 left and then the rest of the group said we are going to go study for exams. I said ill come with you guys (I am in a good relationship with all of them). The girl looked at me as says no you cant. I said why? Thought she was joking at first (she would let me sit with her anywhere else). She claims im not her age and I need to go with my friends (confused as none are around and it would always be fine to go with her,she has friends not her age too). I said no ill come and she got really angry quickly. I was not forcing her to let me come, but I was confused as to why I could not.She just flipped out at me for no reason. I then asked why are you being rude? I just said ill be fine coming and she got really angry at me and I felt it was wrong to do so. Okay, I get she said no, but they way she said it was like im being exiled out of her realm of people. All of the friends with her were like wtf did she just do? I asked one and he was like yea I would totally let you sit with me. I was never a jerk or rude to her and she basically was thinking im just ignoring her feelings. \n Later texted her saying im upset you yelled at me and she says I cant do this and its the way it is. I tried to stick up for myself but everyone was like wtf is going on with her. I have sat with her hundreds of times before and she was fine with it.I felt like she was being selfish or arrogant	Girl seems to have gotten angry for no reason, was I wrong here?	387	13	askwomenadvice
Past year has been really great for me,Girl I met mutually has been good for me, we are mostly similar and have similar interests. I was feeling down alot and struggling and she completely changed me and its a great feeling. I asked a couple of ladies on reddit and in other forms,most say she is totally into me and I should just ask her to something. She has does alot of things that seem like she is interested.I dont know what the ladies of askwomenadvice think though. Maybe some here could help me Guage her interest. \n My last encounter with her went pretty well, and she then came up to me and talked to me the next day. Seems like I did a good job here. She looked pretty/nice to me and had to let her know. \n I like alot of things about her and I kinda feel stuck. I have asked her to things without bothering her about it and she really seemed interested and even has asked for when I am available, I just asked back to show I was interested and she gave me her schedule. However, She has been extremely limited on time and I have been trying to work around  that with her.She has explained to me she is working on it too.She is not just giving me a bunch of excuses as to why she cannot get together. \n I also do not have alot of experience with things like this so I feel stupid or like things are not working out.It not like I cannot hold a conversation or I just sit there and suffer, but other things I have never done before.

"We were out drinking. We were outside a bar on a very small patio, probably 4 feet of space to move around in at any area, though it was a long patio. I was standing at a little table, admittedly I was in the walkway and obstructing it. \n My boyfriend wanted to get past me, so he pushed me. Not hard, but enough to make me mad. I don't like when people get physical when words would achieve the same thing. So I asked him, ""what you can't use your words?!"" And so he said, ""ok then. Move your fat ass.""

This girl I know well has often said she looked bad. Be it clothing, weight,her dress choice,etc. I have said she looks great after telling me she improved on her weight, she still was kinda nervous like adjusting her clothes and hair and trying to make it seem like she never mentioned anything, she did smile a bit and said thanks. Her dress according to her was bad so she changed it for a different one and I said you looked great and she told me how she exchanged her dress for another and why, going on and on. I told her dont worry you looked nice and she seemed okay. \n I feel like I could say something to her so it just makes her feel good or boosts her self esteem.Its not exactly low, just an effort could help. Do I just tell her she is beautiful or gorgeous? Or should I do it some other way like compliment her clothes? I know body parts are a definite no.

Hi ladies of reddit! \n Hopeless sap here, starting to shop for a ring for my GF. We've been dating for a year, and I want to pop the question sometime in the next few months... As I've been reading up on the basics of rings (the 4 Cs, rough cost guesstimates, etc.), I know I'll end up getting something around 1 carat, but my biggest question is about clarity. \n At what point does the stone start to suffer to the naked eye? As much as I'm impressed by an IF or VVS clarity diamond, I know my girlfriend (and hopefully soon to be fianc\xe9) well enough to know she won't care about specs... She'll just want something shiny and pretty. Plus, let's be honest... When she shows it off to our friends, her family, her coworkers, etc., she's not going to be carrying around a 10x lens with her, so should I focus on a higher quality cut and color? \n Really, any advice from Reddit would be very appreciated. Thank you in advance! \n EDIT:	Need a ring, but don't know what clarity to look for.	174	11	askwomenadvice
"I've been friends with this girl for about a year (lets call her Em), and I finally confessed my love to her on Friday. I wouldn't say we were best friends, but more like mutual. We would sometimes talk to each other whenever we saw each other, and it would always be positive. We had french class at the begging of the course of this 'year' and had connected pretty well and was always fun to talk to. Half a year goes by, we don't have any classes together and I begin to talk to her less and less. Now at the beginning of this year, I'm really into her. Butterflies in my stomach into her. I'm extremely shy when it comes to expressing my love, flirting or even trying to give hints to people I like. I may have started to over think a lot of the interactions I've had with her. It got to the point where I asked my friend what to do, and she said to just be straight up with her, but in a sweet way. Fast forward to this Friday that just passed. I finally build the confidence to ask if I can speak to her during lunch. She says yes! I see her later in the day and asked what I needed to speak to her about, and I said I would tell her later. She goes: ""Is it important?"" and I replied ""yea"". Im sure she knew 150% what I was going to ask her at this point. Fast forward to lunch period (around 1:30 pm). Things went a bit downhill as I didn't see her where I told her to meet.  I walked home (like I normally do during my lunch, 5 min walk) and I text my friend thinking she just completely stood me up and knew what I was gonna say. I then text Em asking her where she was. She replies instantly ""omw"". Me: ""Oh shit I left school already, can you wait 5 min?"". Em: ""Cant you just tell me on here?"" Me: ""I'd rather tell you in person. :/"" Em: ""Okayy I'll wait :)"" I had my hopes up pretty high at this point, but was scared shitless at the same time. I get back to school and ask her to go outside for 2 minutes, she follows me. Here's the dialogue for the conversation:\nMe: ""I'm just gonna be honest because there's no easy way to say this, but I like you. I tried to see if you were giving any signs as to if you liked me somehow or not. It was always different, some days you would talk to me, other days you would try and ignore me and I'm not really sure. I just want to know your thoughts of me.""\nEm: ""OP, I'm really flattered. I think you may have overthought everything, I'm just not into anyone at the moment.\nMe: ""Ok""\nEm:  as she walks away  ""I'm glad we could clear things up.""\nMe: ""Yea""  put a fake smile on my face \nThe end. \nTell me, what does this scenario mean? I'm sure when I get back to school on Monday my entire grade if not the entire school will know I confessed to her. I don't think things will be awkward, but I'm not really sure. I still really like her and I can't stop thinking about her. Is she just not looking for a relationship right now? Is she not attracted to me and wanted to let me down in a better way?

Hey everyone, \n I've been seeing a girl I met on tinder for 2 weeks now and we get along really well. We have heaps in common and she is super sweet. \n On Thursday night she told me that she had never been with anyone before and that has made me super anxious about making any kind of move to be more intimate with her. I'm really nervous about being her first and I don't really know how to approach the situation.. \n Not sure if this adds anything but I'm 21 and she is 20	I've been seeing a girl for a few weeks and she has had no sexual experience, not sure how to approach being more intimate with her	94	26	askwomenadvice
I am 22 and my girlfriend is 21 and we have been together almost 4 years. We have a very loving relationship that I potentially hope to continue through to marriage, she really is that kind of material! \n The last year was really hard for us as a couple due to her being diagnosed with rectal endometriosis, polycystic ovaries and chronic IBD. Fortunately all the tests show she will be able to have children in the future (which relieves us both) but the treatments she has to take are not so nice. \n She will start taking a concoction of HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapies) which consists of menopausal-type inducing injections in a few weeks. This will be compensated by taking oestrogen gel to bring her female hormones back in balance. \n The problem I have is all these drugs and treatments she has had to take prior and what she will take in a few weeks has done and will continue to cause her libido to completely shatter. \n She has also put on a considerable amount of weight which is causing her to be extremely self-conscious of herself, regardless of how many times I tell her she is beautiful and such (it really doesn't bother me!) but it worsens the libido issues even more. \n We haven't really had a proper sex life in the last 6 months and she has apologized to me, so I know she has realized it also. She asked me to do no-fap last year which is a personal problem I am trying to overcome, and at present I am succeeding. \n The problems may be highlighted by this fact but all my friends around me are having great, energetic sex lives which I almost feel like I am missing out on. \n I try my very best to support her, and I have done since all the problems started last May. I know she really appreciates it but she has said in the past that she 'feels like a burden' all the time. The general depressive attitude that she has got from all of this has robbed so much of the lady I fell in love with I get really quite upset sometimes. \n I guess what i'm asking is a little woman's perspective, am I being selfish to miss having a proper sex life when her health is so up and down all the time? I support her 100% and I wouldn't dream of breaking up with her over it, but I also don't want to make her feel guilty, either... its an endless cycle in my head :(	My girlfriend got diagnosed with a load of horrible illnesses which I support her 100% with.

"Some background information: \n \n We've been close friends for about a year \n She hasn't had a boyfriend \n I haven't had a girlfriend, nor told previous crushes that I like them \n If she responds positively to the news, I'll ask her out, but if it seems like she doesn't feel the same way, I'm just gonna end with telling her how I feel \n I'm not sure if she feels the same way \n She gets anxious easily \n \n So, pretty self-explanatory, I'm about to tell my friend that I have a crush on her. As I have 0 experience with this kind of thing, I'm wondering if it would be weird/overkill if I listed 2-3 things that I find attractive about her, or if it would be taken as a sweet compliment. \n For the record, it wouldn't be something dumb like ""your butt, your boobs, and your face."" I'm probably gonna go with ""the way you ramble about things you're passionate about, your intuition (which she prides herself on), and your sense of humor."""

I\u2019m 22F, half Indian/English and have noticeable hair EVERYWHERE in places that other people don\u2019t \u2013 chest, back, stomach, breasts, neck, hands etc. \n I\u2019ve been to my doctor and I don\u2019t have PCOS or any other medical conditions. My mum is not hairy and neither are my dad\u2019s sisters and mother. \n I had laser hair removal on my arms, legs, chest, and underarms 2 years ago which cost \xa32000. In between my 6 sessions, it seemed effective as my hair was falling out more and more as the sessions went on. After I had completed my final session, about 3 weeks later everything had grown back :( \n I was so upset that the laser did not work because it was the last thing I was relying on to finally solve everything. \n I decided to try a different laser (the soprano ice laser) last year as it sounded really good. I only got my legs done as I didn\u2019t want to waste too much money if it was ineffective. The same thing happened \u2013 it was effective between sessions but all my hair grew back immediately after. \n I think 12 sessions of laser hair removal over 2 years has ruined my skin. (I was fine with the patch tests). \n When I use hair removal cream or wax my chest then this is the result:  I can\u2019t win because if I don\u2019t remove the hair then it is really noticeable, but if I do remove it then it is red and spotty and my hair starts growing back after 4 days. Either way I need to cover it. \n Here are my legs, they are always red too whether I shave or wax: \n My arms are really red and spotty if I get them waxed, they are okay if I shave them so they are the only part of my body that I can show: \n I haven\u2019t had laser on my stomach and don\u2019t wax/shave it. I guess you can get an idea of how hairy I am on my back, chest etc from this :( \n Thankfully I didn\u2019t get laser on my face so my skin is fine there. It\u2019s okay in autumn/winter as I just need to remove hair from my face. \n Since I started working I\u2019ve been having panic attacks as I can\u2019t find something to wear that covers my chest/legs that is also smart when it is warm so I have to book annual leave and stay at home when it is predicted to be really hot. I\u2019ve never had this issue before as I always had summer holidays during school/college/university. \n I don\u2019t know what else to do, when I search online everybody mentions laser hair removal but there must be something else because laser didn\u2019t work for me. I\u2019m never going to be confident enough to wear anything that shows my body hair in places like my chest/back. \n I\u2019m so fed up. I\u2019ve started feeling suicidal. I get a bit of male attention but I\u2019m now so scared of men and getting close to them so I push them all away. I can\u2019t wax/shave my whole body all the time because it is too time-consuming (and expensive if I go to a salon for waxing) so I can\u2019t be in a relationship. \n I feel so disgusting and unattractive and I just want to be able to wear what I want, it\u2019s hard to find tops that cover my whole chest every single day. Thanks if you read this far :(	I have excessive body hair everywhere, laser hair removal did not work and I don't know what else to do.	582	20	askwomenadvice

I (59F) have an issue with my spouse (59M) who I have been married to for 23 years.  The issue is when I need help he will not respond in a timely manner or seems to care if I live or die. \n Let me explain.  2 years ago I was walking fast through house and fell over a doggy gate and shattered my elbows and lower arm.  I lay there calling for help for some time as I couldn\u2019t get up.  I called and called.  Finally my mother (80) who was staying with us for a short while due to illness heard me calling.  Finally my dad and mom came to check on me.  Then my husband came in.  He finally agreed to help me off floor.  He was gracious enough to drive me to hospital.  They had to send me home in a soft cast until an orthopedic surgeon would be found who could repair the damage.  He took me home and I got into bed.  He asked if it was alright if he went to work. I said yes. Typically our small dogs sleep in same bed.  That night he put them in bed and they were jumping all around.  I asked him to take them and sleep in another room.  He told me it was their bed.  They kept barking and barking.  I asked him to keep them quiet.  He wouldn't. Finally I was able to get myself up and went to sleep with my mother (post open heart surgery).  My mother took care of me while I waited the 8 days to find a surgeon.  The surgery was done.  I know have a prosthetic elbow and several plates and screws to hold my arm together. During this time I had to ask my husband if he would possibly bring some food home for us.  My mother willed herself off the bed and found a way to cook us eggs and spinach as that was what was in house.  We ate it for days.    Anyway I got back to work in 3 weeks and managed to drive myself two hours several times a week for physical therapy for several months.  I also managed to get over it.  When I asked him what had taken him so long, didn\u2019t he hear me fall, he said he did but didn\u2019t think it a big deal. \n I have asked my husband to answer the phone when I call.  Setup a ring tone he knows is me.  I call him maybe once per month.  Recently, where I work due to an agreement with the Union, we had to rehire a man who was termed for poor behavior toward other employees.  He is also a convicted rapist.  I termed him.  When he came back I was and am frightened of him.  I termed him.  I asked my husband to make sure to answer my calls.  He hasn't \n So we come to today.  I had been working in the yard and brought the dogs in for a bath.  While I the shower one started having a seizure .  I called him for him and he answered what.  I yelled I needed help and why.  He finally came after one of the dogs started howling to get out.  When he came in I asked didn\u2019t he hear me call for help.  He stated I didn\u2019t say what I needed help with.  I stated that HELP was sufficient. \n He has always been this way\u2026.very slow to respond, takes things not very seriously. \n bold	Is this normal? .	588	4	askwomenadvice
"I'm a 23 year old male who recently has tried (and failed) many times to meet someone who could potentially become a girlfriend.  With each of these failures, I think more and more that it must be my approach or something that I'm doing, rather than terrible luck (although, I haven't completely counted that out yet either haha).  I feel am pretty limited in how I can meet people at the moment (I have graduated college and work full time) so I am on a dating site and Tinder.  The select few who I do manage to strike up a conversation with on these seem to lose interest quickly.  I try to have legitimately meaningful conversations with people, ask them about the things they like/talk about in their profile, joke around, etc etc.  I am possibly coming off as overinterested, but the alternative is being dull, and in the competitive world of online dating, I feel I need to separate myself from the dozens of other guys that likely contact them daily.  I have also tried meeting people in real life (aka bars) with the same luck.  I personally don't like this method anyway because the environment and state of mind people are typically in doesn't foster a good initial connection.  But at least here, people can see the ""real"" me and my personality. \n Anyway, that's about it.  I think I covered it all, but I can provide more information as requested.

Hey, looking for a little help. \n [Background] \n I'm a 17 year old male and I've been in a ~4 month relationship with my 17 year old girlfriend. She is my first real love and I can honestly say the feelings I have for her are different than any I have felt before. We have a nice open relationship and we both really care for each other and we have what I would consider a healthy relationship physically and mentally. There is a problem though and I would like some help on what I should make of the current situation. \n [My Problem] \n So here is the problem, I have been unfortunately gifted with the curse of overthinking. My Dad suffers from severe depression and has been needing a lot of medical help recently that has made thigns stressful for my family. One thing my Dad does is tells himself that he would be better off if he left our family, and generally overthinks things and lets his brain tell him he is not worth it. I am beginning to realize I have the same problem and I constantly tell myself I'm not wanted by my girlfriend. \n This becomes a problem because my girlfriend is really bad at showing affection, she is afraid/scared/whatever to ask me to hangout all that often, and also doesn't initiate kisses or things of that nature. She is a really shy person that has been ridden with trust issues in the past that make it hard for her to want to show affection. \n I have problems letting people in, because I have told myself my whole life I am not wanted. My girlfriend is the first girl I have ever wanted to open up to and let myself feel loved by. I brought the subject up and accidentally made her feel pretty bad(she knows about my family situation), and she sent me a really nice long text telling me that she really cares about me and is sorry. \n I guess I can't change her, I just really hope she cares about me the same way about her and that she isn't just saying it because she likes the idea of love and not the idea of loving me. We are both working on our issues together and I really hope we can continue to grow as a couple. \n Do you ever have trouble showing affection? Or can you instantly change for someone you truly care about? \n Thanks	I have trouble feeling wanted and my girlfriend has trouble showing affection.

Hi gals, \n I'm a male, and I'm having some trouble understanding a situation that my coworker was in a few months ago that she just vented to me today. \n A few months ago, one of her friends asked to come over, and he made a sexual advance on her. She didn't reject him, and he undressed her and performed oral on her and did some other things as well. She tells me it was against her will, but I'm having trouble understanding how she could say this if she didn't reject him. Over the next few days, she allowed him inside her house repeatedly to do these things, but I'm having trouble figuring out why she'd allow him to enter her home if she was being forced against her will. \n Please help me understand her. \n Signed, \n A guy just trying to understand his friend	"Female friend says that she was forced to do things against her will, but she never rejected her ""assaulter"" and allowed him back into her home for 5 days in a row after the first incident.

"The usual: I'm a guy who likes this girl. She's a friend from college. We're the same age. \n Yes I have asked her out , to watch movies, she said yes and we did it, twice. The first time we stayed and talked for a minute or two after the movie ended, but the second time we stayed for about a half hour just talking in front of the place we went to and I offered to drive her home because it was getting late (I remember a lovely detail - I know she's into Indie music, and so am I, so before I tuned an indie radio station in the car I told her ""I know you're going to like this station"", the name of the station came up, she laughed and said ""oh, you know me so well"") Sorry for the cheesy detail but I just had to share it :P \n Now we're in exam season and don't really have time to go out again. We see each other in college from time to time and she does this thing where she grabs my arm when she starts talking to me, it's happened more frequently lately, and she rests her head on my shoulder for a little while too, which I read as great signals! She laughs with stupid jokes too and it warms my heart immensely. \n Never having had a girlfriend my brain keeps telling me ""yea but, you know... maybe she's just being super friendly"". \n She doesn't avoid me and never answers coldly to my texts, so it's not like I'm chasing her and she's trying to run away. \n I'm not even the one who's always actively starting the conversations - about a month ago she recommended me a movie (Annie Hall, by Woody Allen, if that helps), I watched it and we talked about it, we both loved it and she said she knew I was going to like it. \n A few days ago she saw a quote from the movie on facebook and tagged me in a comment. We then talked about how little time we had to watch movies these days and she said that when our exams ended we should watch the same movies and then talk about them, needless to say I felt super happy. \n So today she was sitting next to me, she was recovering from a cold and I jokingly said ""well, good think you're sitting right next to me then"" to which she replied ""yep, I like you so much I want to pass you my infection!"" with a hilariously evil look. \n So, women of reddit, what do you think and how should I try to confirm or deny my suspicions?

"Hello, \n So I (32m) met a woman (32f) through work at a semi isolated place. Talked a bit, some drinks, etc and spent some ""time"" together. After several days of heavy flirting, kissing, and cuddling (yes cuddlng!!) we stopped due to her having concerns about starting anything here, and also due to an ex. I told her that the past doesn't bother me, I am interested and would like to try several dates, but would respect her wishes and wait until the timing was better. \n We still talk frequently, and text, with her asking me several times where I am at, if I am busy, etc. I have been being attentive but still giving her space as well, respecting boundaries. We still have drinks together, coffee several times, always talking and learning more about eachother ( even though it is very hard for me to open up due to my past). \n I still flirt with her, light touches, jokes etc, and have even done several massages. Have not made a move other than physical contact. Again, respecting her boundaries and wishes ( damn hard though!!). At times, she still stands close, and I get the ""look in the eyes and little smile"" look that to me tells me she wants to be kissed.

"First, this is going to be long, and I hope this is an okay subreddit to post in. I don't know where else to turn right now. \n For most of my life, I've been living with what I can only describe as  extreme  paranoia. I'm sure that word gets tossed around a lot, but I honestly have to call it extreme. It's affecting me in my daily life now, and I just... Want some opinions on how to overcome it. Here's some examples: \n \n I constantly worry my SO will leave me, cheat on me, or end up hating me, despite there being absolutely zero signs of any of this happening. He reminds me constantly how much he loves me, and I know it's true - but I cannot stop worrying every day that he will leave. He is also aware of my paranoia, and does everything he can to help. Like sleeping with the TV on, reminding me he loves me, etc. \n \n I am unable to sleep most nights because of my active mind. I think about the house catching on fire, and what I would do in said fire, and my animals  dying  in said fire. I worry about tornadoes when the wind picks up just a little bit, I worry about the roads being icy in the morning when it snows. \n \n Whenever my SO goes to work, I panic. I actually  panic.  I get scared he'll die in a crash and I'll never see him again. When he doesn't text me because he's busy at work, I get scared someone is holding them hostage or he's been shot and killed or kidnapped.... etc etc. \n \n I cannot sleep in the dark, or even be in the dark. I refuse to go outside to throw the trash out at night, and I even hate driving when it's dark outside. I panic about what could be hiding and waiting for me - even though I know monsters are nothing but fairytales. I also cannot sleep in complete silence - I start hearing noises that aren't really there. I have, on occasion, suffered from night paralysis, where I will both see & hear things that aren't there. The dark is one of my biggest problems - I have to sleep with the TV on, and my air conditioner, or I cannot sleep at all. I am literally terrified of the dark. \n \n \n \n These are just a few examples, the ones I can think right off the top of my head. I worry about being kidnapped or killed everytime I'm in public, I worry about my animals wellbeing, etc etc. These are things I worry about  on a daily basis.  Yes, I have all of these thoughts in a single day. \n It's affecting me. And in a very bad way. I am always stressed, or scared, or a combination of the two. I need your help, Reddit.

"Good afternoon, \n First, if I'm in the wrong sub, please tell me where you want me to take this and I'll get out of the way! I chose this sub because I want real, direct feedback from strong women and you clearly exist here. :-) \n I'm relatively new to divorced life. My ex and I both had our issues so the past is the past. We just had different wants and needs. \n About me: I love and respect women, their strength along with their softer side, and believe that a good partner can complete a man's life like nothing else. I know there are many different opinions here about men that are ""old school"", meaning it's important to open doors, pay for checks, etc., and I respect those that aren't a fan, but I can't change who I am. I love every aspect of treating a woman as if I'm the luckiest guy in the world. I'm loving, affectionate, complimentary, supportive, and truly give myself completely in whatever manner she wants or needs.\nSO, here's why I'm asking for guidance; my ex-wife didn't like the attention. Hated affection and anything related to it. Wasn't big on any of the stuff I openly offered. I hold no hard feelings there because I guess it's just not as important to some as it is to others, which means there's somebody perfect for her in the world that holds the same likes/dislikes. I wish it had been me but it's not. But now I've met somebody that I find to be very special and I am in territory I'm not familiar with.\nShe's beautiful, even though she humbly says she's not. She's affectionate, thoughtful, funny, etc. All of the things I hoped I could get my ex to learn to love, she has. AND, she likes me too. lol Kind of important, right? \n The advice I need: She's very very cautious about committing. She loves my kids and says things like, ""if we date, I can totally see your daughter and I hanging out"" or ""if we end up dating, I think you're incredibly sweet and...."", you get the drift. This has been going on for about a month and we've been talking since August.\nFor the record, I totally respect her need for slow movement! I just don't know how to do things to not scare her away. I like her SO much and could fall head over heels in love with her, which makes it hard to not say stupid mushy things that I'm afraid will make her feel pressured. \n So, the request: please give me advice from a woman's perspective. She deserves her space and I want her to have it. I also want her to know how much I like her and enjoy her company. Further, I want to continue to build on what we have and earn her trust so that she'll one day tell me....well, whatever it is you say when you become a couple. lol It's been a LONG time. \n I am open to any and all advice, including negative feedback if you feel like I'm doing something wrong. I want to make this right for her and guys suck at advice. I get a lot of, ""don't treat her too nice. Women don't like that"". I'm not like that by nature so I really don't know how i'd even attempt to be ""that guy"". \n Ps - Edit:  Questions that go through my head - do you want me to answer when you call and respond to your texts right away or do you actually find it more attractive that I'm not always avail? \n Do you WANT to hear how interested I am or should I avoid talking about that stuff altogether? \n I'm so lost.  lol \n Thanks in advance! \n Edit:"	I'm a guy who likes a girl, who likes me, who wants to take it slow, and I'm struggling with the best way to do that without worrying if she's still into me or if I need to do more/less/different!	634	40	askwomenadvice

Hi M 23 here .So here's the story , I met her about 2 years ago at a common wedding reception . At first sight I thought I was in love all I could think about was her . About a year later I finally had the courage to ask her out . She said yes we have been dating for about a few months . But here is the problem after dating her I realized our thoughts doesn't match , our priorities doesn't match nor does anything ... But before I could break up with her she says she is in love with me . After she confessed about her feeling I didn't have the heart to break up with her. Don't get me wrong she is almost perfect , she is kind , she is beautiful .... But the thing is I don't feel the attraction anymore . If I break up with her it will break her heart and I don't want to do that but then again if I stay in the relationship it would be a lie. I don't know what to do . I can't see her in pain neither can I see a future with her . Please don't hate me I tried everything I could but it just seems like I can't really connect with her . she is so gentle I fear if I tell her the truth it will devastate her . please help :(	Thought I was in love realized I am not , can't break up because I don't want to hurt her feelings.	245	21	askwomenadvice
I am in my last year of college and have been dating my SO for almost 2.5 years now. I am 22 and he is 24. \n Being in the college of engineering most of the friends I meet are predominantly male. Every so often they invite me to go out places with them or a situation where they would be coming over to my place. My boyfriend has expressed to me that he would very much so like to meet my guy friends before I hang out with or invite them to my house so that he feels more comfortable with who I am with when he is not present. (We are somewhat long distance and only see one another on the weekends by the way) \n He is not restricting me or saying what I can or cannot do, just asking to meet them first. \n Have any of you other ladies (or men) experienced this in your relationships? Is it as simple as just knowing who your SO is spending some of their time with? Is it to see the intent of the relationship from the friend to the SO? Do some of you view it as being over controlling? \n Thanks everyone, your opinions are highly appreciated :)	Is it controlling of my boyfriend to want to meet my guy friends before they come over or we spend time together without him present?	208	25	askwomenadvice

Just a little background, in a few weeks I am going to be proposing! Exciting stuff right?! I can't wait! However, she told me a while ago that when/if I propose, I should buy some lingerie and we can celebrate. It seems almost too good to be true! \n Here are the things I am struggling with- I am clueless and do not have much much to spend. I live in Nebraska, not too many lingerie shops around apart from Victoria's Secret. My SO is about 5 foot 9 in. She is very slim/athletic build. I believe she is 34A and don't worry I will be checking again to be 100% sure. Also she is very self-conscious and is slowly gaining more confidence when showing off. Also, none of her friends seem to know anything about lingerie. \n I have checked out this conversation: \n The conversation is two years old - does anyone know if any of the information has changed? \n I have found a few things I think she would like on VS and Frederick's.

Dear /r/AskWomenAdvice \n I'm an early 20s guy and I recently seem to have a problem when it comes to talking with girls I wanna get to know. \n The problem is not that I'm too afraid to talk to them, but rather that I don't know how to get them to keep the conversation flowing smoothly. \n I'll gladly ask questions (and I make sure to ask questions that aren't just yes/no) and they honestly give me great answers, but they barely ask anything. \n Is this a sign of disinterest or is it possible that they just don't know what to ask?

After a while I ended up with different schedules and group of friends.\nThen out of nowhere in the past few months, 3 guys from back then messaged me.

I got this girl's number after chatting on Tinder for a couple of hours. I don't use Tinder as a hookup app necessarily, I'm looking for something casual but I'm totally willing to see where things go from there. I've read on this subreddit that after getting somebody's number, you should arrange a date as soon as possible, especially if it is somebody you have never met before. \n I had to go out of town that weekend, but said that we should meet up the following week. She seemed totally fine with this, and has been texting me everyday. We actually have been having very natural and playful conversations, and initiate a pretty equal amount. We have talked about a specific bar a couple of times and how we both like it. I'm going to that bar tonight, so yesterday I asked her if she wanted to meet up there. She says she wasn't on planning on going out this weekend, but would love to next weekend. She continued the conversation and it's still flowing nicely. She has asked me quite a few questions and also given me unsolicited personal information, which leads me to think she's still interested in meeting up. I just don't want to text this girl I haven't met from Tinder for close to three weeks before having our first meeting. It seems like a long time, I don't know. \n There probably isn't a problem at all here, but I have no dating experience and would like some input from the female perspective.

"I [20F] got my Nexplanon contraceptive implant inserted at the start of June, so I've had it for almost two months now. Before that I was on the pill (Mercilon) for about 5 years. I didn't have any real problems with the pill, except for the fact that I kept forgetting to take it, even after all those years (and I did try alarms, implementing it into my routines, etc). So I decided to try a more permanent, safer and less stressful option, seeing as contraception is free where I currently live anyway. \n After getting the implant, the nurse recommended I should keep taking my pills until the end of my current pack, so I did. Everything went great and the small cut and bruises after the procedure healed up well. I didn't really feel any different emotionally after I finished my last pack of pills, but I was anxious about how my periods would turn out (the pill helped me with pains and I always had short and regular periods when I was on it). The nurse had told me that 1/4 people get prolonged bleeding, 1/4 get normal bleeding, 1/4 get irregular bleeding and 1/4 get no bleeding at all. \n So a couple of days after I finish the pack of pills, I get my period, but it only lasts for a day. The next day there's nothing, and the day after that I'm bleeding again. Three days pass with nothing, and then another day of bleeding. This has kept happening with irregular intervals since then, sometimes with a week between these ""one day-periods"", sometimes two and sometimes just a couple of days. The nurse warned me that it could take up to three months before everything becomes ""normal"" (as it will continue to be for the next three years), so I intend to wait and see if it will get any better. She also said that if my periods started to bother me, I could be on the pill and the implant at the same time, to regulate the bleeding (which really doesn't seem healthy to me?). So if it doesn't change I'll either do that or get it taken out, I guess. Also, when I do bleed it's mostly a dark brown, sometimes almost black colour. Only 1/10 times does it look like regular blood. \n So my questions are: Has anyone else experienced this, and did it get better after the first three months? If not, what did you do about it? I would love to hear about any experiences you guys have with Nexplanon, good or bad (and especially concerning periods). Sorry if this is long and poorly written! English is my second language.

As a soon to be senior I know many friends in long-term or short term relationships and I haven't had one since my ex almost 4 years ago (tried twice since then but nothing past a first date)... \n I'm committed to school and so that's always been a focus and I don't want to force a relationship. But part of me feels like I'm missing a large chance in college to possibly meet someone special. \n Any advice on how to meet or chat up a girl? I don't live on campus, I commute about 20 minutes to get there everyday. As far as clubs go, I don't really see many that fit my interests, besides men's golf and things of that nature. So that's probably not going to help. \n I asked one of my female friends for advice and she said to just frequent common study places or even a Starbucks and see if someone strikes my interest... To me that seems odd to just sit down at someone's table in a coffee shop or study area even if you ask politely (I mean I'm there to study not meet someone). The coffee shop seems more suitable but still odd. Thoughts? Suggestions? \n Is asking female friends if they know anyone weird or needy? I've had that suggested to me as well. I wouldn't be completely opposed to a blind date but I'd rather know the person first. For instance, I'd probably prefer going on a date with the girl I just sat down with over a girl someone suggests to me. Probably because I found her and somewhat know her as opposed to the other girl my friend knows. Maybe that's weird? *shrugs	I'm a commuter and haven't invested much time in looking for someone.

Me [F19] and my boyfriend [M21] been dating for a few months now and I trust my boyfriend completely, but I will admit that I am the jealous type. He's planning a trip to Vegas with some friends and mentioned that they might possibly be going to a strip club. I knew he'd been to one once before and gotten a lap dance, but this was over a year before we even met. While I'm not a fan of him being around naked or nearly naked women at all, I know that it's ridiculous to think he never will be or that he'll never look at other women, and since he would only be going to the strip club since it's kind of a special trip I wouldn't ask him to not go at all. \nThe idea of him getting a lap dance though makes me sick. I can't fathom letting that happen if he was at a party or a normal club and some girl did that, I would be appalled. I think paying for it is even worse. We have an awesome sex life and there's nothing he's wanted to try that I haven't enthusiastically agreed to. Am I being ridiculous if I ask that he not get a lap dance since it makes me so uncomfortable? I just can't picture being comfortable being intimate with him when he gets back without thinking of some stripper being all over him. I feel like I'm the only woman who should be touching or getting touched by my boyfriend. \nBefore anyone suggests it, I have no problem if he wants the same from me. I.e., no dances from male strippers. That's not something I've ever done, nor had an interest in doing. The only reason I would ever be around one would be for a friend's bachelorette party, and I definitely would not be getting a dance of my own.\nEdit:	Is it reasonable to ask that my boyfriend not get a lap dance while in Vegas with buddies?	321	18	askwomenadvice
I am usually not good writing out my own feelings on reddit (throwaway account, by the way) and I can't help but realize I caused a lot of damage throughout the night. \n So lets call this woman Mary. I met Mary years before the event, professionally. She was 18 and I was 19. We worked as salespeople for a company in NYC. She recently got hired, while I been there for a month or so. We worked together and had fun overall, we took walks through the city to get home and talk a lot of things. Honestly, I don't remember what we have talked about, but it was not any grand conversation. After a while I left the company due to school. That was the last time I saw her before the event. \n Fast forward to now, I saw Mary at the event with her group of friends not really talking to anyone and just sitting there. I, as the ecstatic person I am, was overjoyed I met her again! We couldn't talk a lot because the music is loud, but other than that, she told me that she was waiting for a friend. Okay, I can see that. I told her that I am going back out to dance and have fun. \n Near the end of the event, Mary moved over to the other side of the club and still looks like she wasn't interested in anything. I left her alone for a long while, and then came back once more to see if she is okay, but she was  still sitting there staring into space . I asked politely if I can sit next to her, which I did and in turn she told me that she was getting chilly. \n So I started to hug her and things went intimate. I nuzzled on her neck and kissed her for a bit, asking if she likes what I am doing (she kept nodding her head but she sat still, worried about her friend more than anything). I stopped for a bit and asked her about what her friend is doing and how we can get her before the event officially ended. \n After we were pushed outside, she spent the time walking around the entrance looking for her friend and because she was cold, I kept hugging her and rubbing her back. \n After that night, Today I called her about her friend, where I found out that she was fine all along and with Mary. We talked a bit, finding out that she lives nearby and she is available to hang out with. \n I can't really tell, but did I do anything wrong or non-justified? \n Mary and I are around 21 years old. \n EDIT:	Went intimate on arrival, She was worrying about friends at the moment, feel shitty.	455	14	askwomenadvice

"Mini-Wall of text incoming) \n About 1 year ago, I joined my sister's guild in World of Warcraft. In this guild, I got to start knowing a certain lady, (F21), who was my fellow guildie. After ~4 months of mutual friendship, we started playing League together. Over time I developed interest in her, but never made it clear to her. About August of 2014, one of her friends (M23) broke down in feels over her and caused major drama. Then a few weeks later, another friend (M21), got really drunk at a party and (in the most drunk way imaginable) told her how much he loved her. She of course, rejected them both. After witnessing these two incidents, I decided to not try anything funny with her, that she would probably not be interested. \n Cut forward to December 30th, 2 weeks ago. Our WoW guild community had an IRL meetup at my sister's place where we celebrated New Year's together. My, by now, nice lady friend showed up to the meetup aswell. About 2 hours into the New Year, she kissed me and told me that she was  really  into me. We then proceeded to have sex in my sister's apartment.\nThe next day, I went on a walk with her, and asked what kind of relationship she saw it as, and she said ""I'd say this is a fuck buddy thing."" \n It's been a good solid 12 days now since that fateful day, and I am still unsure as to how to feel about it. Personally, I would like it to be a ""real"" relationship, but I also want to be in a FWB relationship, to get my pent up sexual urges out with someone. What say you, ladies? Should I tell her that I would like something more, or be happy with what I've got now? \n (Note1: I asked her how many FWB's she's had before me, and the answer was: ""A lot. But none of them have lasted very long, because they get... Attached to me."") \n (Note2: We live a fair travel distance away from eachother, so we won't be able to meet more than once a month.)"

Maybe some of you have had a similar experience and can give some insight. \n We met over Thanksgiving break in November at a party and after we met we pretty much spent the whole weekend in bed together. After break, we both went off to separate colleges for two weeks but texted every single day over that period pretty much 24/7. We talked a lot about sex but also about ourselves and stuff we wanted to do over winter break with each other, such as going out to eat, etc and even kind of dabbled a little bit into what it would be like if we were ever together in a relationship. He was the one who brought a lot of this conversation up. Also, I usually wouldn't just casually text about sex with someone who I just met but for some reason I felt this connection with him over it because we found that we're extremely sexually compatible in terms of the things we like and libido. \n We planned on spending a lot of time together over winter break. Which we did, however it was pretty much just hooking up every time and I found myself initiating a lot more than I thought. We also never really texted at all over break except to figure out a time to hang out, which I know can be good to talk in person rather than over text however whenever we hung out he was always in a rush to leave because he had places to be and we didn't really have time to talk. Now that we're both back at school he hasn't texted me at all. I texted him the night he got back to ask how the drive back was and he responded and never texted me back after that (that was just Sunday night). \n I really like this guy and I wouldn't be worrying except that I assumed we would be texting and talking a lot more. Towards the beginning of break we would kiss goodbye after we met up and then towards the end that stopped happening. So essentially I guess the main question is if he liked me would he text me? Should I continue texting him even if he doesn't seem interested in keeping a conversation? But also I guess I just want somebody else's viewpoint and if it looks like it's going anywhere anymore. \n I understand we've only known each other for a little over a month but it was intense in the beginning and now it's worrying me that it's slowed down, especially because he was the one doing most of the initiating and initiating conversations up until winter break. Also I guess just to add in he just broke up with his ex in September after about a year of being together. \n I was planning on asking him how he saw us at this point in person before break was over but it just never felt right at the time and now I don't know when the next time I'm gonna see him again will be. I'm thinking I should just let this go and let him go but at the same time I don't want to cut it off just yet. Also...I guess it would be important to note that I drunkenly let him take a video of me sucking his dick so I feel like since he has that I can't just simply cut ties. Also, if this even matters he still looks at all my snapchat stories. \n I don't think he's playing games, cause I don't think guys play games like this in dating but that's what I'm trying to tell myself...:/	Met a guy over thanksgiving break, texted 24/7 while we were back at school, and it slowed way down ever since we started winter break. \n Also, sorry about the length and rambliness of this post.

"I need some advice on a tricky situation(25M/23F) and a little warning ahead: a lot of love, drama, relationship and slightly 'offmychest', but I hope someone will take the read \n When I wake up, she's on my mind. \n When I go to work, she's on my mind. \n When I am home again, she's on my mind. \n When I am trying to sleep, she's on my mind. \n This has been on repeat for almost every single day during the summer. It's the third time I have on crush on her, first one was almost 4 years ago. I have spent every 2. or 3. day with her for about 3 months now. We can talk for hours and hours until the sun sets, afterwards we will look at the night-sky and keep talking until it gets too cold. On the days where we don't meet up, we are chatting all day instead. \n The difference this time is that I have confessed my crush to her and woah, she did not turn me down...! But she did not say yes either! \n So here goes all the trouble - She has been in a relationship ever since I met her. And the first thing I heard about her boyfriend 4 years ago was: ""I don't want to talk about him!"". Some years have passed since then and I haven't heard any positive stories about him, only seen a few vacation photos of them together. Now I might not know much about relationships, but it seems the only reason they're together is ""because it has always been like that"". \n I've heard her say it many times: ""I wish he would just go away, that way I won't hurt him"". They had 3 big fights during the summer, 2 of them were before I confessed to her. 3 other times she fled her own apartment because of ""bad vibes at home"". Whenever I ask her why she stays with him she says: ""You don't know him that well, he is a good guy!"". \n Now the funny part is that all the times I have met him, he turned into a douche after ~2 beers. Not only against me or other friends, but also against her, to the point of them arguing. A comment from him, that has been stuck in my head for a year now was: ""Hey [Me]! If you want to find a girl like [My Crush], you just have to catch one while she's young!"". (Same night he also said that I clearly must be gay) \n To me and a friend of mine, it definitely looks like an emotionally abusive relationship, but we really don't know what is happening in her home. \n I really need a woman's point of view here - Can I help her? Let her figure things out by herself? Abusive relationship or am I seeing things? What to do?  Any advice is greatly appreciated :)"	Third crush on girl, told her about it, was not turned down.

"So basically , I've had a crush on this girl for about 3 years before \nmy best friend told me crushes don't last that long. Even  after that i didn't say anything for about 2~3 more years. I had convinced myself that this was to pass with time. Also that i've had a fear of rejection. And telling my self that if i never try i will never be disappointed. \n So my friend told me that i should speak to her about how i feel towards her.  If i want anything to ever happen. \n So i mustered up every bit of courage i had. and i went and spoke to her. I wouldn't say it was the best profession of love. \n So here's the Story : \n After about 6 years of loving this girl. i go up to her and tell her how i feel. She tells me that she doesn't speak to boys. \n Oh have i despised that line. ( Given that we're arab muslims. and tradition here states minimal contact between genders. She is an honest person. so i've figured she was truly saying the truth. Having never having a relationship in the last few years because her ex broke her heart in devastating way. ) \n So i felt devastated. and never spoke to here again. ( This happened 2 years ago ) until this last sunday school day. \n So here's how it went... \n One day while sitting in the Cafeteria , I saw her. and i had this rush of feelings that i've never had before. So i didn't say anything that day. \n Late at night when i was getting to sleep. i sat on my bbed under my covers thinking about how i feel about this girl. and concluded with everything in mind that i Love her. \n So i went online. Read about how i would speak to her about my feelings. \n And i read that "" The answer is always no if you don't ask "" \n So i wrote a speech before i went to bed. it was a good one. \n and the next morning i went to school like normal. and i told her. \n Her reply : ""I'm not looking to be in a relationship right now. Since at this age people would talk. ( Again, We're arab muslims. so this is a big deal. ) But maybe we could be friends. and if there's anything you need. i'll be there for you.

I'm currently a junior in high school, and am quite popular. I'm fairly decent at sports and am quite tall, but am fairly insecure and extremely shy around women, often keeping to myself. \n Recently met a girl, and have only known her about 3 weeks. She happens to be in my math class and Spanish class, and sits literally right next to me. She is very giddy by nature, and seems to be quite outgoing. A day or so into our new arrangements, she was talking about a sub and lightly punched my arm. Like I said, I barely know her so I thought it was a little bit odd. The next day she punched me lightly again, I don't recall why. A few days in she rested her head on my shoulder for a few seconds, and would often grab food if I had some without really asking. Then she began talking about a crush of hers, and made sure to mention he was extremely boring to talk to.  The next day, yet again, she stated this crush of hers had friendzoned her hard the night before. She would mock me every so often, making some sort of face, and at one point was mocking every action of mine, (sitting back in a chair, folding her arms, etc etc.) She has also stated on multiple occasions she hasn't ever had a boyfriend, made I quite clear she did not smoke or drink booze, and even stated she was not popular, and had few friends... ( which is untrue, she's one of the more popular girls.) Suppose another interesting this to note is she has literally belched in my face on one of two occasions. No accidental slip, turn and literally just belch. \n Not really sure what to think of it, as to be honest she has a whole lot of other guys who are always pestering her for her number, her Kik, etc etc, and I have a hard time believing I'd be liked by a woman so far out of my league that I'm on another planet. \n Not only that, and its a small thing I guess, but (I don't\nReally know how to put this without being creepy) she doesn't ever look at me, unless I approach her, and normally doesn't really talk to me. Every remark she makes is normally aimed at her friend, but seems to kind of have like, an invitation to speak.. I guess. Its honestly sort of difficult to explain. \n Sorry for the long explanation. I'm clueless, and would love some help. If you guys think she's interested, how should I go about my next move? In high school, (asking her out for a drink isn't an option.)

So she says I was raising it up too high, and hurting him.\nFor me, I didn't see I was hurting him at all. He was crying, but he's always crying when we change him, it's like a rule.

"Girlfriend and I have been dating for 10 months. Things were really really really good. \n Two nights ago, we had a small, easily solvable disagreement that turned into a major fight. We were each at our own (different) apartments and having this fight via text/call and she basically said ""I'm done"" and I basically tried to talk her into staying. I was kind of heartbroken and started drinking to cope and I got really drunk. It basically turned into like one of the most awful nights ever and she said some really mean shit and I ended up saying worse things I regret and also (and I barely remember doing this, I was like blackout drunk) making some vaguely suicidal threats. That totally is unlike me (never been depressed or suicidal ever, I'm pretty laidback and easygoing) and I admit, like the most shitty thing you can do to get someone to stay in a relationship with you when they don't want to leave. She showed me some of the texts I sent and I was like disgusted with myself. \n She called me yesterday morning to see if I was ok because of the nature of what I had said. I said I was, and we kept talking and basically agreed to try to stay together because we both agreed we had kind chemistry between us that we really unlike anything we had ever had before with anybody else and we did love each other. Her one condition after we addressed some of the stuff that had been said last night was she kind of felt like I was smothering her and she would need space if we tried again. I agreed. That was yesterday morning. That afternoon, she texted something about having makeup sex that night. I said ""yes please"" and went over to her place. We started like kissing and then I tried to progress things normally. She said still kind of felt weird and wouldn't feel comfortable having sex with me for awhile, and we would have to take things slow. I said okay, and we ended up just falling asleep holding each other in her bed. \n This morning, as I was leaving, I said ""Love you"" as I left as I had a hundred times before and she said we should hold off on saying the l-word until things got more normal between us. I agreed. \n Texting her today, she was really slow to reply, which was unlike her. Also, her replies were kinda terse and short. I asked her if she wanted to hang out after work and she flat out changed the subject and didn't reply. \n I'm not an idiot, this isn't my first field trip, I'm getting the major vibes that we're all but done, despite our resolution to try again and stay together. Do you ladies agree? Is there anything I can try to do to salvage this sinking relationship? What kind of hurts is that we did hang out and cuddle and kiss last night and it kind of got my hopes up that we might return to normal one day and now today kind of made me feel bad again. \n Thing is, she said I was acting a little needy even before our fight and needed space. I agreed to give it. I don't know if this is her taking the space she needs or if that fight killed us for good. Or if it's been one day since this big huge fight and I should give it more time before we're warm and close again (last night snuggling and kissing notwithstanding.)"

I started dating this girl 2 years ago and we really clicked and we formed a deep connection. I've always been depressed though, due to moving at age 13 to a different country that I hate, and that eventually wore off on me. \n I got lazy, I didn't express my feelings for her in any way. Eventually we broke up after some tough fights. We talked about everything, and she still has feelings for me, but she has trouble dropping the hate she has for me because of how I treated her when we were together. \n So, anyways, I found out she was seeing a guy for a few weeks, and they kissed, and she jerked him off. She broke up with him and told me everything, and that she still loves me. She started apologizing and calling me ""baby"". \n Now we're at the point where she loves me but still isn't ready to be with me. I want to show her how much I love her and care about her. I really feel like I understand that I was bad to her and I really don't want to let her get away.\nI ask that any criticism of me, her, our ages, or anything of the sort be withheld, although I don't think that'll be an issue on such an understanding subreddit. \n My question is, what can I do for her that will show her how much I love her and care?

As I went to kiss her outside her house at the end of the date, which we usually did for a fair few minutes on other dates, this time only lasted maybe 10 seconds and she just said ""Ok"" patted me on the shoulder and turned to her house and walked away. \n I can't shake the feeling that things may be over between us, without anyone saying anything about it and I can't fight the urge to just text her saying ""Are we good?"" but I honestly feel that is a bad idea and I need someone to tell me that. What course of action should I take? Should I text her, should I not? I feel I need closure but I could also be wrong and I caught her on a bad day :/"	5 dates with girl, get on really well, says she can't really see me much because of exams coming up, went to cinema with her tonight, seemed distant, kiss at end of the night was a lot shorter than usual and kind of awkward.

There is a girl at my office that I am attracted to. But I am pretty sure she doesn't feel the same about me (called me brother, suggests ways for me to hook up with people) and almost certainly has a boyfriend. So I know being friends with her will only emotionally hurt me and I try to keep my distance from her. Although we used to work on the same project, I am not assigned to that project anymore and will talk to her very seldom and only for work-related topics. Other than that, I just ignore her and act like she doesn't exist. \n The problem is that she regularly tries to initiate dialogues with me, eventhough I always give short answers and try to show I am not interested in talking to her. Regardless, these attempts reset my progression for forgetting her. I don't understand what she is trying to do. She is a clever person and I think she knows I like her. She is not a very friendly people person that tries to be friends with everyone either. \n So, my question is, why is she acting like this and how can I show I don't want to be friends with her without having to talk with her and making the situation awkward? (because obviously we work at the same office and sometimes have to interact )	I need to a girl to understand I don't want to talk to her without explicitly saying it	230	18	askwomenadvice
"So right now Im a junior college, and last year I had this friend named Hannah. Now Hannah and I were strictly platonic friends, nothing more, she is prettty far from my type, as while I always admired her ballsiness she thinks everyone is falling head over heels for her. \n Anyways, being college students we would often all go to bars/clubs together, and whenever Hannah joined us she would get REALLY drunk, as in she would almost be passing out in the corner of the bar\nShe is totally willing to drunk drive if she is able to walk to her car, she once threw up on the floor of my friend's parked car even though her door was open. One time she even jumpped into the middle of the road in front of oncoming traffic while me and my friend were trying to take her keys from her. So you get what kind of person she is, especially when shes drunk. \n Anyway, one time she was nearly passed out in the corner of a club and I was sitting next to her to make sure she didnt throw up on herself. She starts trying to stick her hand down my pants a few times, but i just chalk it up to her being beyond wasted and just hold her fucking hand instead. Her dress is also nearly falling off so i push the strap back up. \n Fast forward to the next day I run into her and when i say hi she just walks right by me. Later on I heard from my roommate that she said ""Omg firstfromthesun is into me and its really weirding me out, he was holding my hand all night and i think he was trying to fuck me."" After i hear all of this shit i am straight up done being friends with this bitch, so I figured, sure Ill just try to flirt with her from now on until she pisses off for good, probably a mistake. \n Fast forward again to this semester, apparently shes been saying I molested her to literally everyone i know. Idk if she actually thinks thats what happened, because there is no way she remembered that night clearly, or if she is just trying to fuck me over with my friends, because i would not put it past her at all.

25 male here who is in a happy 6 month relationship! :) \n &nbsp; \n I recently met her mother. She is a lovely lady but rather pushy. We go over regularly for dinner and 2 weeks ago she asked if I could help with the dishes. Of course I can help! \n &nbsp; \n She did not want me to spoil my clothes and opened a drawer to produce a feminine apron. I said I wouldn't need one, but she insisted and ended up tying it on me. My gf was giggling and thought it was funny. \n &nbsp; \n Last week she asked me to help again and I said I wouldn't mind, and she came over with that same apron. I said I didn't need one, but again she was insisting and put it on me. \n &nbsp; \n Now I don't mind helping out, but the apron she is making me wear has flowers on it and frills. She said it's specially made for dishwashing because it's plastic coated. It's heavy, uncomfortable and I feel like she gets a little bossy and condescending while I'm wearing it. She just oversees this dishwashing procedure and comments on what needs to happen including wiping the counter tops and table at the end. \n &nbsp; \n My girlfriend even took a photo and says that it looks like I'm wearing a dress. \n &nbsp; \n I don't want this to become a thing between my gf's mother and me, how can I prevent this from happening?

"We broke up because I let things grow dull and I didn't support her passions. We fell into routine to much and things got boring. I did not set up fun new things for us to do to keep things interesting. The other reason being is that I did not support her passion of vegetarianism. When it first started I figured it was just kinda of a faze and teased her about it. The teasing continued to rise as her interest in vegetarianism rose to. It got to the point where we would have stupid arguments every couple of days about food. These arguments never got escalated but I am sure I got on her nerves enough. It has been a little over a month since the breakup and I consider myself stable emotionally and I have let the relationship go. I know that our old relationship is never coming back and I do not want it to. I want to start something new where we have both learned from the issues of the past. Yesterday we went out to eat together and she said she was really happy that she came and that she had a good time. Today we went to a Farmers market and everything went well. Here is the real kicker she is moving about an hour away for college in 2 days. This will complicate things for me but I know it will be worth it.

"I want to remain vague, but I have been tossing this around in the brain for days and I hate to turn to strangers rather than into my relationship, but I need some outside perspective on this. \n I've always been a musician. Since I was in elementary school music has just been in my blood. I have played in a lot of bands, I've played large venues, opened for national acts, it's just a part of who I am. \n The last band I was in I put a lot of time into and turned into a fairly successful act that was actually beginning to get some international attention, and my SO was very excited at the prospect because she thought I was going to be rich. We have definitely suffered through some hard times financially, but I've always held down a job and contributed to my family. \n After that band gained some attention and was becoming successful, differences in opinions over how things would operate led to me departing from the band on bad terms. \n At this point we were expecting a child and though I had always supported us, we were struggling with money because, well, she decided she didn't like her job and quit. \n So I took up a job that literally left me no free time to pursue music. I tried to tell myself ""Well I'm glad I'm done with all of that anyway..."" and sometimes I am to the extent that there's a lot of bullshit that comes with it that I really don't miss. \n However, recently, a chance came up for me to do a project and I thought about taking it up because my job that used to be two states away is now going to be about an hour from home. \n She was immediately very guarded and upset at the prospect of this. I had no intention of making this something that I'd do in attempts to become famous or anything, I just miss playing. \n I finally got her to tell me what she thought about it, and she was very apologetic and felt guilty about it, but said that she felt it was more important for me to have a good job and focus on that than to follow my dream. \n I am not trying to sacrifice the well-being of my family in order to follow some half cocked dream that I'm going to be rich and famous, I just don't feel like myself when I'm not playing music at least sometimes. If I try to pick up a guitar she tries to get me to do something else, and when I said a couple of years ago ""look I'll hang it up and get this job you want me to get"" she was overjoyed. \n I don't feel like it's about not having money, I feel like it's about not really wanting me to be out in settings where she feels like I'm going to get in trouble or cheat or something? But I never would, it's nothing like that, and what's more frustrating is I often get the ""you aren't the person you were when we got together"" speech, but she doesn't understand about how much I'm missing out on things I enjoy. It is simply ""I don't understand how you could say you don't feel like yourself, You're always you..."". \n I want to say I'm sorry this is part of who I am and you have to accept that to accept me, but I don't want to if I'm really not in the right to do so"	My wife doesn't want me to pursue my hobbies under the guise that it's not good for our family.

"This isn't as much of an ""issue,"" as a little speed-bump that I could use your help with. \n I'll cut right to the chase here... I became engaged a few weeks ago to my wonderful girlfriend (now fiance). I was given a deal by the jeweler that if I paid in cash I could save over $1,000+ dollars on the ring cost. I decided to go with this option because it was a deal I couldn't turn down. \n Obviously after making such a large purchase my ""entertainment/social budget"" has taken a temporary hit. I didn't buy a ring I couldn't afford by any means, I just saw my account dip lower than normal due to this purchase. My original plan to apply monthly payments was tossed to the side after the jeweler gave me this deal. \n My fiance isn't one who wants me to spoil her in the least, but we have a habit of going out to dinner a lot over the weekend (which we split down the middle). I made a comment to her a few days ago about scaling back a bit on going out to eat since my funds are low. She asked why, and I told her I'd like to cool off on the spending for just a bit and to let me account recover from the ring. \n She became really upset after I said this, and started guilt tripping herself saying I didn't need to buy her this ring. She feels bad ""it cost so much,"" and that it's affecting other parts of my life (I never told her how much it cost). \n I tried explaining to her that it's nothing to get upset about, and that I was happy and proud to buy the ring for her. She kind of shutdown a bit after that and wasn't fully comprehending what I was saying to her. \n Anywho, I probably fucked up by being so direct with her regarding my funds being low. How can I present this issue to her better? We're really great at communicating, and have never had an issue like this before.

To be charming enough? \n Or you simply cannot even imagine it, and he better not waste your time? \n Can he make up for lack of height by being a strong, stable person, and packed with muscle too? \n Or by some other traits? \n Maybe you have a story to share how some shorty gotten to your heart?:) \n Everyone's welcome to respond, I'm just thinking that really tall girls probably have a different perspective, hence the title. \n Looking forward to some honest answers:)	Shorter guy looking for advice on getting a chance from a significantly taller girl. \n Just realized there are posting rules, so trying to adjust my post now.

"Before I begin here some context: it's summer, I'm a cashier at a gas station working my way through University, and I'm an introverted 20-somthing y/o guy (not the scummy type...I hope). \n Maybe because it's summer and I tend to see  a ton  of people on a daily basis at my little store, I've been noticing the women that enter my store more frequently. Not in a, "" Hey I wanna slam that salmon! "" terrible manner, but more along the lines of, "" Wow, she looked great in that dress. "" or "" She has beautiful eyes/smiles/hair/ect. "" or "" She was really nice! "" (some people can be not-so-nice, unfortunately).

I'm a 20 year old female and I get that this is only normal considering my age but I can't handle myself anymore. I have never had sex and don't plan on it right now due to body issues etc. I masturbate everyday and sometimes more than once. I stopped watching porn because its unfulfilling and instead sext/phone sex with a guy friend of mine. I've been regularly going to the gym. Eating mostly healthy and sleeping the right amount. But regardless of all this, I feel horny almost all the time, especially with this guy friend.

I work in construction which is a male dominant field, so I don't have the chance to meet women much and I have not had a girlfriend in about a year and a half. I get really shy around girls when I first meet them (Think Raj from Big Bang Theory) The female friends I do have give me very out of character or grandmotherly advice, such as, just go to bars (I don't drink much), just be yourself (I am myself and it isn't working), or ""You're a handsome and any girl would be lucky to have you.

Hi, girls \n Imagine that your boyfriend/husband is a typical couch potato. \n Spends weekends doing nothing but lying on the couch, surfing the web. \n Gained 16 kilograms (35 lb) weight in the past two years, claiming it's genetics (look above). There is also absolutely no coincidence, that you stopped cooking a year ago, because you got fed up with being the only one at home that cooks and since then eats only 'heat-up-and-eat' foods from the supermarket. \n Throws a fit when you offer a diet plan as a birthday gift and claims it's mean. \n Later accepts the gift, but claiming he wants to start diet in January, because of Christmas. \n Gains 2 kg (5 lb) during Christmas. \n Finished college and has a master's degree in economy, but still earns 2.5 times less than you, earning very close to the minimal wage in my country, but yet still gets  offended  when you refuse to have a common budget (as in: my sallary + your sallary = common budget) and instead instit on splitting the bills for the flat in half. \n Did no attempt to increase qualifications for 7 years. \n Threw two fits within one evening. First for insulting his intelligence, second for using too difficult vocabulary. \n Does not do any chores not being asked for. And when - cleans the bathroom which takes about 20 minutes, leaving the kitchen etc to you, Which takes about 2 hours. When asked to switch for once refuses, because he claims, he detests the kitchen. \n Although he finished 30, he still can not stand up to his mommy and gets bullied by his older sister. \n When asked to drive you to ER because you have a really painful cramp in the neck and literally can't move your bloody head, asks: 'and what will the doctor do? just wait till it's over' and then asks if he can refuse, because he has a common cold and not feeling too well.

Okay so a bit of backstory I suppose. My mother and aunt got my grandmother and grandfather a 'coupon' book for Christmas: my grandad is dying of cancer and so obviously they need a lot of help with things, just managing life in terms of transport, cooking etc. They really loved the book and it seemed very cute. So I got to thinking, why not mock one up with various things my girlfriend likes to do for Valentines? Not in terms of 'she needs these to get me to do it' but just as a cute accompaniment to the real gift. I am worried, however, that it would be taken as 'this is the only way I'll do these things' which is definitely not the case \n My girlfriend and have been together for 2.5 years now and it's a pretty stable, good relationship. We aren't big spenders on each other: my Christmas present cost 18 euro and hers 24, we just don't spend a lot of money on each other. That said, I am worried that this may come off as cheap on my behalf and so if I get it as an accompaniment to a more tangible present, a book say, it might offset that? \n And finally, is the concept itself sweet? Or is it tacky? \n So,	1: Do romantic coupon books, self made ones, come across as saying that 'this is the only way I'll do this things'?\n2: Do they come across as cheap?\n3: Are they sweet or tacky?\n4: On the whole, are they good ideas. \n Thanks for any help!	218	47	askwomenadvice
"I'm a female and 25. \n So a few years ago I started coming down with ""Yeast infections"". These ""Yeast infections"" result in the skin between my vagina and anus cracking typically in several places (which is very painful). \n I went to the doctor and after examining me she let me know that while I didn't have a yeast infection I have higher than normal levels of yeast. She said some women just do and that the only thing that I could really do to give myself relief was to wear men's boxer, wear skirts/dresses, or just go without underwear. \n I've tried the men's boxers but they typically are a little big for me and make my pants bunch up and this does not look good; I have to look professional at work because I'm a manager. \n Option two is impractical because I live in a cold snowy state but I do exercise this practice in the spring/summer. \n I tried option 3 but having your vagina leak all over your pants is not fun... \n My real problem with the situation is I'm married and this is preventing my husband and I from having sex as often as we'd like.

Hey everyone, \n I would love to get some insight in the following situation, as I can't really figure it out myself :) \n Me, 24yo guy met a 20yo girl through Reddit, we live in the same city and started exchanging messages through Reddit, talking about our interests, university ... the usual stuff :) \n At one point when we were talking about our taste in movies I suggested that perhaps we could go see a movie sometime. \n I think it's necessary to point out that we have not met up in real life yet, and that my suggestion to go see a movie sometime is not necessarily asking her out on a date, this person seems pretty nice so just watching a movie as friends would also be totally fine with me as well. \n Anyway, in the messages that followed she mentioned that she pretty much likes all types of movies and then talked about some other topics. \n Now my question is;  \nDo you think she consciously ignored my suggestion to go see a movie sometime? \nWould she be ignoring the question to be nice, so she doesn't have to say no? \nPerhaps she thought I was asking her out for a date and didn't want to shoot me down?\nMaybe for some reason she actually didn't see my suggestion? (doubtful) \n I'm not quite sure if I am reading into this too much. I don't want to ask the same question again and be seen as some pushy guy or w/e. \n Any insight you would be able to provide would be most welcome :)	Talking to girl on reddit for a week, we live in same city, suggested we go see a movie sometime, does not respond to suggestion but does keep talking to me.

"There is a girl of the same age (16) in my history class (I'll call her Jenny) that I have feelings for. She is quite beautiful, smart etc. (all the corny) stuff but she is also somewhat distant and I find it hard to communicate with her. I've noticed that whenever I'm around she acts a little odd and if I walk by she seems to ""half-look"" for a moment before I catch her eye. I haven't really talked to her (on occasion about trivial things just to spark conversation) but this sort of thing has been going on for a while. The other day I asked Jenny a hypothetical question (probably a bad move but I'm not all too experienced with such things) about whether or not she would be interested, and she said maybe. We both then smiled and went our separate ways. I also gave her my number but didn't receive any texts from her during the past weekend, which put me off somewhat. However, when I returned to school she continued what I had mentioned before, so once again I was left confused. Finally today I played it casually and asked if I could have her number, in which she hesitated sightly, so I told her ""No worries, I wouldn't want to be pushy"".

Me (M19) and my girlfriend (F19) have been together for 4 months. We are from a country where sex before marriage can be considered as something that is frowned upon, it's not particularly taboo but it does a have a bad name attached to it socially. As a result of this, she feels that sex and her virginity is precious to her and she wants to wait for marriage for sex. I respect her wants fully and I understand what she feels about it. \n I like to do things to do sensual things to her like kissing her neck or rubbing her thighs and some pretty intimate stuffs but she pushes my hands away after awhile most of the times. At first I thought she was not enjoying it but after some talks she finally told me that she doesn't like it because she gets aroused and wet when I do these kind of intimate touches and kisses to her and because of her views on sex in general, she gets kinda frustrated that she's wet but she's not able to do anything to satisfy it. She has also told me that she hates to control that feeling because she feels helpless. \n Some additional background, the girl I'm with is comfortable with talking about sex or porn-stuff in general. We've talked about our fetishes and stuff and she's very comfortable around me but she has told me that she wants to wait till marriage for sex and while I've been doing intimate touches with her, I avoid touching her breasts or butt because she feels that it is too intimate for her. She is from a conservative background and while she does watch soft porn on YouTube, she told me that she has never tried masturbation before and the thought of it makes her feel dirty. \n With all of this mind, I wish to respect her boundaries and I'm asking what should my approach be here? I would like to sexually satisfy her without intercourse but at the same time with her views on sex in general it's really difficult for me to open her up and I'm clueless on what should I do in this case. Are there any things that I could try or suggest that would respect her boundaries but at the same time satisfy her when she gets wet or aroused? I've seen articles talking about fingering and oral sex but I don't think its possible for me as she don't even touch herself. \n At the same time, is it wrong for me to worry about her sexual satisfaction? I've tried to talk to her about masturbation and how she can please herself if she feels horny but she has a negative attitude towards it and I feel worried that she will get frustrated over this and possibly ruin her views towards sex. Is my worries normal or am I being too insecure over something that is not that significant?

Since then he has gotten in shape and everybody is noticing how handsome he is. \n A mutual friend of him and this girl messaged him on Facebook and suggested the 3 of them hang out. \n He described to me last time they hung out, over a year ago when he wasn't in such great shape, and she wore a very skimpy, flattering outfit (a little white crop top and shorts that fit her curves) and high heels to go see a movie. He said that all the guys in the theater were looking at her. \n The rest of our night together after this Facebook conversation basically revolved around how he was so infatuated with her and he even said that if she made a move on him he would basically have trouble resisting. She is basically better than me in every way, she is prettier, longer hair (a fetish of his), in better shape, more conventionally attractive and likes to wear (his words) slutty clothes. She is also the same background as him and I am not. We were lying in bed and he told me that he is so conflicted. \n I'm going back and forth between anger, guilt, jealousy, sadness... Am I overreacting? He told me that they are going to hug because he hugs all his female friends, but she's not even a friend, they haven't even spoken in over a year!!

I still have one semester left until I graduate, but she graduated last Spring.  I think that she likes me because she always seemed to talk to me and pay more attention to me than other people that were around; I always thought she was attractive and pretty cool.

My boyfriend wanted me to do sexual stuff with Jill because it would be hot. I was semi ok with this. So I talked with Jane who said she would be into it and she asked Jack. \n Jack took this poorly and said he would kill or stab John on multiple occasions. In text and in person. Today was the final straw as he said he would stab him if he even looked at Jane. He said that he wouldn't even need to do it himself. He could send someone to do it.\nWhat is happening now: Now I'm worried for John's safety. I want to go to the police or the school and report this. But i'm worried about personal repercussions.

"So this comes from the idea of being able to create attraction and pass ""shit tests"" from a women. I read some of the red pill and some or r/seduction.  I read a lot of men lower their value by by being reasonable, kind and thinking about their responses and decisions. Instead of acting out of what comes to their head immediately, even if its horrible, mean and unreasonable. I've read a lot of what lowers a mans value in a women's mind is him being to kind, thoughtful and letting things slide, even if they aren't a big deal. I'll give an example. \n Me and a female were on a date and she had finished off some of the recreational drugs i'd bought for her previously and myself to use sometimes. I had mentioned I do not mind at all if she indulges while I'm not there. So when she mentioned she finished them I first thought ""wow you finished it all?"" but then I thought about it and was like ""well let's be real, I've got plenty of money for more and I can easily acquire more. Why make a big deal of it. I hate fighting. So I said ""No prob sweetheart i'll pick us up some more sometime and we'll have a good time"". Did I fail a shit test and lower my attraction? I'm sure plenty of women hate red pill and PUA advice..But I have to say I see a lot of it working in the real world. \n I was raised to be a reasonable person who thinks before he acts. Though I've learned this doesn't work so well in the dating world. Is it better to just say a horrible thing that comes to mind first instead of thinking out a proper response? Say a girl mentioned she had a threesome with 2 other guys I might initially think ""wow thats kinda slutty/nasty, are you one of those girls that just sleeps around with everyone?"" which is HORRIBLE, i don't actually mean that. Maybe society/religion/whatever has engrained that into our minds, I know its WRONG to think said things so I wouldn't say that. I would probably respond with ""wow crazy, I bet that was nuts. Was it fun? Did you enjoy it?"" Even though maybe I think she might be a little wild and extreme, her sexual past does not define her and i'm not going to judge. I wouldn't be against doing this with a girl or said girl (i've done it before with other females) \n I hate people who judge others or who lash out and say the first thing that comes to mind without thinking before they speak. Never wanted to be that person, but I find these are the guys with girls swooning over them for the most part. No matter how irrational or horrible the things they say are. I don't want to lower my value to women, but I also don't ever want to slut shame, lash out with unreasonable bullshit, or make them feel bad for doing things they enjoy or want.

Ok, so first of all this is a throwaway account as my other acc contains my real name (error!) \n Anyway, I need some advice on how to get my gf to renew her passport... \n Basically I've been with my gf for almost 6yrs, we've lived together for almost 5yrs and are very settled indeed. I want to propose to her in Venice next year. She's a teacher so we are limited to the school holidays. \n However, her passport expires in spring next year (exactly when I'm planning to take her). I want to keep the trip a surprise until the day before, but this passport issue is quite a logistical problem! \n We were out with friends last night and we were all discussing summer plans and about how it would be nice to go away together. I used this as a good point to enquire about her soon-to-expire passport. She told me that she would definitely look to renew it before the summer as we usually go on holiday abroad. But I need her to get it renewed at least a month before my planned trip to Venice. \n SO, my question to you wonderful ladies out there, is how do you think I can slyly get her to renew her passport in time?! \n Because plan B (aka the easy option) is to just tell her I'm planning a trip away (without telling her where) and that she'll need to renew it. But this takes the fun out of the surprise of the trip! Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! :-D \n ps.

I realized I can never find a perfect fitting dress shirt in store or online, so a few weeks back I posted a survey to see if other people have the same issue. I found a number of women are very unhappy with the options available to them for fitted business attire. In particular, the majority of women complained that dress shirts never properly fit the bust area and dress pant length never fit properly. \n I\u2019m looking for a way to resolve this issue by offering online dress shirt alterations, in which men and women may order business attire based on their specific body type, rather than inputting all of the exact measurements required by the typical online tailor. \n I\u2019m looking for some feedback/advice to see exactly how women would like to be measured. \n My questions for you are: \n 1)Is this a good idea or am I a crazy person?

(Typical measurements required for full tailor are: shirt length, shoulder width, neck, chest, bicep, wrist, sleeve, waist, stomach, hips, breast point, waist point, sleeve hole and bust) \n 3)When purchasing standard dress pants, what area does not fit properly and what do you think are the main areas that should be altered for dress pants?

"I have been friends with this girl since we were in the 5th grade. She was extremely shy but I understood because I was shy too (just not as extreme as her I guess). We had similar interests in fashion and book taste, we were close bffs and it continued even though we went to different high schools. From freshman to sophomore year she would confide in me on how bad she felt about not having friends yet and still feeling really awkward and shy, and I'd give her support and advice based on my own experiences. I was there for her and the relationship seemed pretty nice and chill to me. \n Junior year was pretty similar with her still being the really sweet girl I used to know, although I did notice some changes towards the end of the year. She got a bit bolder, which I just took as a sign of a confidence boost, which I felt great about. However, it would start to bug me when I realized the vague comments she would make concerning my bad financial situation at the time. I was living in a tight situation with my family and I was raised to not care what people think, plus friends are supposed to not care, right? But I could feel some of her comments sounding as if she were looking down on me. Comments on the type of phone I had, boasting about her parent's stable financial situation. Of course, she wasn't outright bold with it either, but her comments hinted at this a lot. I felt her getting a little competitive with me and it reminded me of how I used to be catty with a bff I had in the 8th grade. I thought I was over that childish drama, and the fact that she may be bringing it back upset me, so I decided to ignore it.\nNow, my financial situation is better and I feel better overall (because I've been feeling shitty and have felt like I had no friends to confide in about it this whole time). \n Now this friend has gone from sweet to as sarcastic as I am. It's cool; I'm glad she's found confidence, I truly am. And I like sarcasm (that's why I use it). But, every day as we talk it starts to sound like something more than sarcasm. Almost like she's trying to bring me down any time she gets, make little remarks and pushy jokes here and there. All aimed at me, even when we are in a group. She used to be the type that I had to be careful what I said, because she used to be so shy and sensitive that I wanted to respect her by not hurting her with my sarcastic personality (I respected our differences). Yet all I get are negative remarks made at me? \n I just don't know how to feel or deal with this. I don't want to confront her yet, as I don't feel it's reached the point where I have to let it all out, I guess. We haven't seen each other face to face for a while, only chatting through texts, so I'm thinking of just ignoring her remarks and then going about how we used to whenever we meet up again. Maybe uncensor myself now that she can apparently take a joke, and just see how she responds. If its a negative response, I think I'll know she's just trying to bring me down with this newfound ""sarcasm."""	"I have a friend who was once super shy and sweet and now has turned a bit mean with her newfound confidence.

How do I do that? We don't have any friends in common, I don't have her number or even email (actually, I know how to contact her, but it is through Facebook or even worse, a work-related site), so whatever I do -- it's going to look weird and probably creepy. \n Should I give up?

"Hi, I'm a guy living in the UK and I just turned 22, I have Autism and that makes all social things difficult, especially relationships. \n This whole story starts when I was a kid. We lived in the north of the country and were inseparable friends at the time. We did everything together. Looking back on it as an adult now, I am certain I had feelings for her, I just wasn't aware of it because I was so young. When I was 10, I moved away to the SouthWest. \n I remember the last time I saw her really vividly. My parents and I were talking to my teacher on my way home from my last day at that school, and she came to talk to me. She pulled me away and basically dropped a feels bomb, she couldn't stop crying. Then she kissed me on the cheek and ran away as fast as she could.  This has been a very traumatic experience for me.  I guess you don't know what you had and how important it was until you've lost it. \n Since then, I have never been able to form any kind of meaningful relationship of any kind with any women. I've always felt very insecure around women as a result and very scared of losing them. So, I've ended up just being distant. \n Around 12 years have passed and all this time I've wanted to go back. I've desperately wanted to find her again, because I feel like I'll never be able to move on if I don't get how I felt (and I think still do) off of my chest. It's like it's weighing me down. \n What makes this especially difficult is that I only have a name and where she lived when I was there as information. Her mother was a single parent, so for all I know, she could have remarried and now my friend's surname could potentially have changed. That would then make the name irrelevant. \n What worries me most is how my sudden return would appear. Is it creepy to suddenly turn up like ""hey, remember me at all?"" Is she even likely to remember me? My lack of an intuitive understanding of social etiquette as a result of my Autism means I worry about this the most. \n I don't mind rejection, surprisingly. I understand that I can't expect someone to automatically feel the same way as me with these kinds of things, and that approx 12 years is a long time. What I want is closure, maybe then I can move on and reform a relationship with her, and that would be like a miracle. If not, then at least I know the truth of the matter, and can finally put it behind me. \n The question is, should I bother trying, and if yes, how do I even attempt to approach her?

I was in college for 4 years but because I am shy (bordering on a recluse) and commuted I never really got involved in the social side of college. As a result of that, I never really started dating or 'hooked up' or anything like that. I'm now working about 4 days a week and don't have much of a social life.

"My S/O (25f) and I (25m) have been together for about 4 years. We have sex enough for the both of us and we both enjoy it (for me, and so she says for her), it may be a little vanilla but not plain. (ex. We will jump eachother in the hallway have sex and pass out in bliss.) \n One issue I've had since the get go is that I feel like her feedback about my oral and hand skills is not very helpful (not quite what I mean). And that she is basically standoffish about her genitals in general. (ex. I will try to introduce oral or more foreplay into our sex and she will be accepting of trying but will provide limited feedback/direction. At somepoint before she orgasms during oral/hand stuff she usually asks that we get to it already. After sex and talking/shower/sleep I usually ask what worked what didn't work. And she will respond with some very generalized statement, ""it was too hard."" ""it was nice."") \n Add 2 caveats, she is extremely vaginal orgasmer. In the time we have dated she has orgasmed once or twice w/ me from non-penetration (hand, penis or otherwise) stimulation. Not that mid-sex clitoral stimulation has ever been received badly. \n Another caveat; afaik (she really is hesitant to talk about it) she uses a pillow to masturbate, humping it. \n My, admittedly self-serving, assumption is that she should masturbate to understand how different things feel for her.  She says she is worried about hurting herself finger-nails and what not.  I got her a small sex-toy a few years ago (ease her into it I thought), which we used once or twice and frankly didn't seem powerful enough. I got her a rabbit a little later, and while it was well received during our sex - she never gravitated to it without my prodding. \n During sex, she sometimes loses the thread of pleasure, but it doesn't seem psychological. \n In one way I would describe my problem is that I want to insure her feelings about our sex-life is in accordance to my own, that it is great, and that it has expanded my horizons of sexual fulfilment. Part of the way I can do that is knowing what works and what doesnt... \n The other is whether maybe this is a fully normal thing for a mid-20's woman to feel not 100% at ease with her vagina (talking about it).

I am a 21 year old male, looking for some tips from a female on style/fashion. All my life, I've never fully understood the concept of 'style'. I saw it, my friends had it, but I could never grasp it for myself. To this day, my average outfit is usually quick and easy to throw on. For example, here's what I wore today: Green-cargo shorts, a Target brand NASA T-shirt, and a pair of cheap Chaco Sandals that I scored on sale last summer (they're starting to rip). \n You might be wondering why I don't ask a guy friend this question, but I have more than once: We'll go out 'shopping', and then it slowly drifts to what they want for themselves. I'll pick up an article of clothing that catches my eye, and they will sort of chuckle at my choice as they go to checkout (boohoo, yeah w/e). I've also asked a girl before, too, which was sort of embarrassing for me to do in person. She got really excited, she took me to the Mall, but we ended up getting pretzels and nothing got done lol. But I'm not here to bitch about my lack of knowledge and experience with style for attention. My point being is this: I don't know style, or how to dress, and have never gotten much help from friends. \n I understand there is a much more in-depth psychology to it (relating to personality, etc). But even simple stuff with like, my hair; I don't know how to maintain it in a way that looks attractive. Of course I wash my hair everyday, but do I use product? No, because last time I did I embarrassed the hell out of myself. Why not go out to Urban Outfitters and just buy what I think is attractive? Because I always end up buying something I think fits me nicely and looks good, until I hang out with my friends and realize how awkward/baggy it is compared to their clothing. It looks try hard and bad. I don't know how to match colors, either. I don't know designers, or where I would fit. I'm very basic. It sucks.

Since a year or so, I am totally in love with a girl in my class. At first, I just liked her but it has developed into a really strong love for her. During the first months that I liked her, I thought it was only from my side. However, after a couple more months, I started to suspect that she also liked me. However, maybe this gut feeling just grew because of my own desires. She is pretty social and extravert, but when she's close to me she becomes more shy and nervous. We don't really talk that much but we have a lot of similar interests. There are also some other 'signs' I discovered the past half year: \n \n she's often staring at me (or a fast glimpse) and looking away quickly \n she is giving me compliments in public \n sometimes she has vicarious shame when I do something stupid (for example with sports or when I say something stupid during lessons) \n she always responds very enthusiastically when I text her (although she almost never texts me) \n sometimes she accidently touches me (but only when the situation is appropriate, for example she accidently sat on my lap \n she laughs at all of my jokes in public (also my worst) \n sometimes she says some suspicious things/signs (but they could also be completely meaningless) \n she has lots of contact with another boy from far away, and she always talk about him when I am near \n she almost never meets this boy, although on her blog she suggests that she has a crush she regularly sees \n when we once discussed, she really looked me into the eyes with big pupils, there was some abnormal feeling about that conversation \n \n But still I can't be really sure, because these signs aren't that clear and there's also a lot of arguments that she doesn't like me at all. \n Do I have a chance? She has become really important to me and I don't know what to do. What do I need to do to know if she likes me?

So ill try to keep this story short but i dont think i can, anyone who wants more insight be free to pm me. \n Hi everyone! \n Thanks for reading this in the first place. Now i've dated this girl about 6 months ago, we broke up and then continued being friends. Tried dating again but she didnt want to because she was not in love with me... \n We continued being friends and up until now i am fine with that, i enjoy being friends with her and we have fun and i am content with the current situation. \n However i still have this feeling for her... I cant describe it, it's kinda stupid because i dont love her like i used to but i do still like and think about her. Last weekend we went to a bar and even though she has a boyfriend now which was her ex at the time she met me, we still had amazing fun and we were kinda touchy with each other. \n Nothing like kissing or anything but just kinda dancing and like giving an arm etc. Nothing special in any way. \n Now there is allot of backstory but lets just say she and her current bf dont get along always. Mostly she is angry at him because he is selfish. She doesnt always looks happy and it hurts me to see her that way. I just simply wish her to be happy. \n So i give her advice allot of times and she even thinks of me like a Dr Phill or something. Now i would like to express my thoughts and feelings to her but i am afraid that she will back off and just end our friendship since she doesnt feel that way. \n But at the same time if i keep getting that feeling whenever we do something i just cant go on. It will kill me from the inside since i see so much more in her then just a friend. The whole situation is confusing for me and im lost. \n I know most of you will say to break it off and move on but i want to find a way to keep being friends while getting rid of this feeling. That would obviously be the best outcome. \n Anyways share your thoughts and let me know :)	Dated a girl, broke up an became friends. Now stuck in whenever i should stay friends with her or say that i like her and with the possibility of never being friends again.	388	33	askwomenadvice
We are not in a LDR it has a month, before the LDR we lived/stayed together for 6 months. Well, we stayed apart for other 5 months and he started seeing someone else. Accordingly to him, he was missing the physical thing. In this 5 months we let things opened, but he told me he was enjoying the time with this other girl, so now he is only my ex. We decided we would be friends but I am not ready for that and I don't think he is as well since all his messages he is very straight and not at all emotional. He in general is like that, but I think he is more now. He told me he still have feelings about be but he didn't know what he feels for me, and that he was confused. Well, I am going to his city this week and I might (wanna!) see him. But I don't know what hope, what think, what feel, what say. I think he is still confused with all this thing. \n Can somebody share your experience with me?

Me(60F) and husband (60M).  I am embarrassed about this issue.  I really do not know how to deal with this.  My husband and I spend time with his brother and wife one to twice per year.  Every since they married she has made it a point to be overly friendly with my husband.  I have spoken to my husband regarding this and he says she is just friendly.  What she does: if my husband and I are talking no disagree she will physically place herself between us and tell him he is right while smiling and laughing up to him.  This past week we were at his parents doing yard and home repairs.  She and I were working on projects outside while husband and brother on other projects.  She left me to go assist my husband even though her husband was there to help.  I mean every where my husband was for two straight days she was.  If he was fixing the sink, she was holding the flashlight, if he was sitting outside fixing the weedeater she was sitting next to him.  Whole family out to dinner, girls were talking...where was she next to him.  He walked to bar to get a beer she made sure she went to get a drink.  I saw red.  I couldn't even eat dinner. Husband told me he was not doing anything...he wasn't...but I feel she is always trying to build an emotional or mental relationship with him and trying to insert herself into his life. \n His brother didn't come sit at my side for two days. \n bold	I am baffled.

"Hello everyone, hope this finds you all well. I'll try to be concise. I posted a similar question in /r/AskMen, but wanted to get your perspective. I am 22 [M] and have a friend of the same age who I've like for a long time. I met her in 8th grade. Anyways, I've wanted to tell her for ages, but always chickened out, telling myself something dumb along the lines of, ""I won't be nervous next time."" There were signs that made me think she might've liked me too, at least at a time. I remember receiving drunk calls earlier in college,  skyping, being invited to visit her at her university, and just weeks ago we hung out with one another's families. She had told me she had a crush on me in 8th grade too. \n Anyways, I know my opportunities to tell her are dwindling, as she is in med school and I am about to start my career, but I really feel I'll regret it if I never tell her. In fact, I already regret not seizing the opportunities to tell her previously. I don't have an endgame in mind, I just want it off my chest, if that makes any sense at all. The only thing holding me back is that she's a someone whose friendship I value and wouldn't want to make her uncomfortable in any way. Any advice is appreciated. I'll see her in two weeks.

I would like the opinions of specifically women on this. Basically as the title said recently me (M, twenties) and a friend (F, much older) mutually started flirting more and more until we started cybering (flirting/talking graphically sexually etc). She just said that she thinks she has feelings for me. It feels deep down like to continue may be wrong, if it can never become more. \n Due to some factors its just not possible for it ever to become anything more, like distance and age, and we spoke about this clearly at the beginning too and were both happy with it. Is my worries right that it would morally wrong for me to continue with doing this with her? She wants to continue doing this, but I'm worried it would be morally wrong, like as if I'd be using her or being selfish and thoughtless. thank you	Is it wrong to continue cybering with friend who's admitted feelings for me?	147	13	askwomenadvice
"So my question is, does going the ""high route"" actually get you anywhere? What do I mean by this? EXAMPLE BELOW!!! \n So this female ""friend"" is going to a concert with friends, I also bought tickets to this concert and said we should hang out and go together, she wasnt interested. So i gave my tickets to a friend, because I dont wanna show up there and seem creepy for whatever silly reason she can think of. We had planned to play a video game together(level up accounts to be precise), but I dont know people who go to a concert with friends and just go home after. So I mentioned how it was awesome that she was going to go with friends and to be more vocal with me when she has time to level up our accounts. She hits me with a ""can do"" and that kind of ends our texting conversation. To me this is me going the ""high road"" but I really want to be like ""What exactly dont you like about me?"".

"A few weeks ago I went out with a girl that I've had a crush on since 2014. We were in an accounting class together and she was by  far  the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. I never really talked to her in accounting due to the fact that she was incredibly gorgeous and I was a nervous and anxious newcomer to the university. Nevertheless, she reached out to me at the end of the semester to study for our final in 2014, however, due to a medical issue, I couldn't join. \n Fast forward to a few weeks ago. She commented on my Instagram saying something relatively complimentary. I responded on Snapchat asking about how her life is going, where she's studying, what she's doing etc. etc. She started falling quiet after about 2 weeks of talking every day, at that point I said: ""Screw it, she's the most beautiful girl I've ever seen, I'll ask her if she wants to get a beer after we get off of work."" \n She says yes. \n We go to a bar of her choosing and [I feel that] we hit it off. I mean, we were playing bocce ball together, there wasn't a gap in the conversation, she and I both were flirtatious, very engaging- it was very obvious that she and I both were having fun. We start walking back to our cars in the parking deck after about 2 hours, she asks where I parked. I said ""up a level from you"", she offers to drive me up to my car. As we're turning the corner I'm thinking ""I wonder what the top floor looks like and if it overlooks the Atlanta skyline."" She turns to me and asks me whether I'd like to check the roof out. \n From there, she parks and we spend the next 45 minutes talking, trading music preferences, watching videos of family and shows and what not. At one point she asked me why I didn't talk to her in accounting, I told her what I said above; that I had a crush on her. She asked me do I still have a crush on her now? I said yes and also that I was a bit intimidated by her back then. She asked me why. I confidently said something along the lines of ""I don't mean to sound cheesy or creepy, but you are genuinely one of the most beautiful girls I've ever seen."" She was very humbled, thankful, and gracious. She wasn't freaked out or uncomfortable in the least. A number of times I was looking out her passenger window (away from her), I would turn my head back into the car and she's  gazing  back at me. She'd ask me what I was thinking as her eyes seemingly pierced my soul. \n I ask her if I could see her again that upcoming Sunday, she said ""Yes, let me see if my sister's (who are in town) want to do anything, however I doubt they'll want to do anything. Just text me and let me know"" \n It was incredible. I was on cloud 9 for the rest of the night, it was an amazing evening... \n I never heard back. \n It's been over three weeks. Now, normally I'd just move on after a lousy date. But this is one of the best dates I've been on. I've relived it a number of times in my head and apart from me telling her how I had a crush, I am 100% positive I didn't come across too strongly.

We talked and joked around, and I did get her number, but we never talked outside of class other than meeting up once to study for a test together. I kind of got a vibe that she MIGHT have liked me, but I never acted on it. \n Eventually the semester ended, and I decided I would try and stay in touch with her. we texted back and forth for a couple days, and we were having good conversation, but nothing serious. I tried twice to set something up, but both times she was just too busy. \n The last time i texted her ended when I had said something, or asked a question that she never replied to. I didn't know how to respond, so I just ended it there, we never talked again. That was about 6 months ago. \n Since then I have completed my AA and have moved out of town and back again.

She had a hysterectomy a few years ago, keeping her ovary (one having been removed before I knew her). \n Before we met, she was a dominatrix in Hollywood with A-list clients for a year (and quit). We had a great sex life for years. The usual 'was a 'freak when we met' story.

She's lovely, and she can always turn my mood completely around even if I've had an awful day. \n So what did I do?  Well, I'm a bit shy, and a bit awkward  (big surprise, aren't we all?)   And she's moving away soon so I decided instead of potentially causing a super tense, awkward situation face to face, that I would write her a cute letter saying hi, that I would miss her, etc. \n Problem is I think I may have fucked up. I think it might have been too ""out of the blue"". After saying ""thank you for working with me and making it fun in the process, you're awesome, etc"" I included my number along with saying something along the lines of ""It's not often I meet people as great as you, so it would be nice to stay in touch and just be able to say hi once in awhile"", I made sure to clarify that she didn't have to call/text me/give me her number if she didn't want to, but that I would love to be able to stay in touch, because I like her as a person, and I like talking to her. \n This was about 3 days ago, haven't gotten any texts or anything, and I see her one last time tomorrow. Of course as I said myself I wasn't  expecting  her to text me, but I would love it if she did. I'm so fucking nervous, I don't know how to handle it if I made her uncomfortable, and I'm worried I did just that. \n To add a little perspective to it, she's very small/petite, super sweet, and potentially a little shy. I'm a tall, muscular, somewhat intimidating guy if you don't really know me, so I don't wanna go charging at her asking her questions and potentially scaring her and making her think I'm a creep, I couldn't live with myself if I fucked up that bad in front of her coworkers and everything. I'm not suicidal, but even that would be enough humiliation for me to want to die afterwards. \n Any advice on what to do/expect? Sorry there's not a specific question here, I'm not even sure this is the right subreddit for this, but my mind is racing and I just needed to get it off my chest and talk to someone about it. I also apologize for the massive amounts of ""and's"" I've used, again, not really thinking straight. \n Any help/advice is greatly appreciated, more than you could ever imagine. <3"	Gave girl I barely know that's moving away a letter telling her how much I liked her, afraid it was too much and that I'm gonna have an excruciatingly painfully awkward encounter with her tomorrow, don't know how to handle it.	495	41	askwomenadvice
It's going to be my girlfriend [of 5 years]'s 21 birthday next month and I want to bj her a purse. I'm terrible at finding these kinds of things so was wander go if you gals can help me out. She likes purses because she wants to appear more feminine. She is very self conscious and doesn't feel feminine enough. She likes antique stuff so I'm revolving my selection around vintage looking purses. One of her favorite designs on things are skulls. But if the more detail i has the better for her. She likes to wear a lot of black so I THINK the purse shouldn't be black? Does the purse just have to match her black? \n Anyway, I have all the information to buy her the purse my self but maybe a few of you ran into something similar to a purse for her and would like to help me out. Oh! Price isn't a factor. But let's not go overboard either d:	"I need help finding a purse for my girlfriend of 5 years.

A person that I consider a friend (we will call her Jo) has a crush on another person (we will call him Tim) in a group that we frequently hangout with. Jo told Tim that she was interested in him and he turned her down and said that he wasn't interested in her about 8 months ago.  Tim and I had hung for a while now (before Jo and I had become friends) and three months ago she told me about her crush on him and how he rejected her.  She also begun to express her jealousy over mine and his relationship and about two months ago it became too much and I actually went to him crying because she was putting so much stress on me concerning this. The stress was insanely difficult for me, it caused me two panic attacks and I really needed someone to be on my side and sympathize with me. The individuals that I talked about this with before I went to him said that I should just be a better friend. That evening we hooked up for the first time and we have been hooking up constantly for a few months now.  She still has a crush on him and I have since confronted her about the jealousy and she has been better.  However, two people recently told me that I should stop hooking up with hooking up with Tim as I am being incredibly selfish and a bad friend.  I know that Jo would be upset if she found out, however, I really enjoy this physical relationship that I have with Tim. It is very easy and isn't anything other than physical outside of our friendship. I feel that she needs to get over him as she was told eight months ago that he wasn't interested and I don't expect mine and Tim's relationship to be anything other than an occasional hook up and our friendship. \n I am 32\nTim is 32\nJo is 28	I consistantly hook up with a person my good friend is obsessed with, am I am bad person?	333	18	askwomenadvice

"So this girl (16f) and I (16m) had the same class and became friends over 3 or so months and I caught feelings for her. Lately, things have taken a turn. She flicks my hair, asks me to sit next to her and gave me her number without asking. We got each other's snapchats and quickly became best friends in it. So far, it seems that she likes me. She sends after-shower-towel-only pics and always replies. \n However, I don't know if I should ask her out. At a point of time, when we were just getting to know each other, she explicitly stated she is ""lowkey asexual"" and that she is not interested in dating in high school and that she only finds boys attractive but not the prospect of dating. This happened after a boy got her chocolates and a stuffed animal out of nowhere.Also, she never initiated conversation over social media or text with me, I usually send something and so on. \n A couple of friends suggested that I am in a deep friend zone and that she feels comfortable enough with me to send pics like that and talk a lot. I'm usually very bad at picking up signals and in my last two relationships, the girl literally asked me out. However, in this case, she shows a lot of signs but is missing some of the key ones(frequently touching, initiating convos on social media). Since I really like her, I want to ask her out, but I'm super reluctant due to her missing signs and that one rant about dating she had. \n I'd really like to hear some advice on what to do next or any other tips for this situation.

"I've been cringing so hard all day. Last night I was on the phone with this new girl I'm starting to date. I don't see her every day because she lives quite a long way from me. Anyway, we were talking about everyday day stuff and when we were about to hang up I told her to ""dream about me"". She said she would, and I asked her ""what are you going to dream about"" and she answered ""you working out naked"", which I think she said jokingly because we were talking about nakedness and gym stuff before. The conversation continued as follows: \n Her:  are you going to dream about me? \n Me:  yes \n Her:  what are you going to dream about? \n Me:  about you naked too \n Her:  naked where? \n Me:  in my room \n Her:  and what are we doing in your room? \n Me:  just both of us lying on my bed, sleeping \n Her:  oh, that's it? \n Me:  yeah \n Her:  are you sure? \n I had [this other incident]( with this same girl some days ago, so I thought that she was interested in having phone sex or just talking about having sex. I decided that I should tease her or give her a hint that I'm interested in having sex with her. \n Me:  no, we'll do some other stuff ;) (this is were I planned to leave it) \n Her:  what stuff? tell me \n Me:  nah, I'll tell you tomorrow \n Her:  you're not going to tell me? okay bye \n Long story short she kept pressuring me a LOT into telling her my 'story' in detail, this kept on going for about 45 minutes or so. She said I sucked at telling stories (and I do), so I made it a little more descriptive. I basically told her I was going to cuddle with her naked and fuck her in different positions. \n I thought she was into it because she kept saying ""and what happens next?"" and ""that's it?"". At one point I even thought she was playing with herself or something because her breathing and voice changed, so I kept going. I kept asking her several times if I went over the top and she said ""no, that's good"". I'm reaaaally bad at phone sex, as you can see, and I hate it but I didn't want to disappoint her. \n When we were about to hang up she said  ""I want to do it but lets wait a little more okay?"" .

Okay so, the situation is not all that straight-forward. In january i (M,24) met this girl (F,18) online, I was in the process of breaking up with my ex, we had emotionally been apart for a while, and just neither of us wanted to give up we did eventually break up after a couple weeks, and are still living together as friends and to help each other financially so we can move to our own places when this lease is up.

Our relationship ws going great, even missing any phyiscal contact (we are about 2500 miles away) it was great best relationship ive ever been apart of everything about her is amazing and as if she was made for me and she said, vice versa. Then a few weeks ago, she was raped. I didn't know what to do, I tried to get her to report it, or at least go to the hospital, which she did the day after.

We've been talking since, worked with her for about 4 months at a grocery store (she was cash, I worked in the back) and even found her to be in my biology class this semester! We even sit right beside each other. We started talking a lot more, caught up on anything new or previous info we never really shared. I'm fully attached to her. I feel like I could easily spend the rest of my life with her, and I've never felt like this before. I got the chance to be in a group of 2 with her for a bio project, and recently went to her house to work on it this past weekend. Everything went good and we had fun despite barely doing any of the work and us just talking. Here's where stuff goes wayside. She recently started talking to a friend of mine in bio, lets call him Daniel. They've been face timing each other almost every night if not every night and have somehow gotten extremely close with each other in a small amount of time. Daniel has a girlfriend so I know its not taking that route, but after that weekend, Daniel asked me what I did over that weekend in class RIGHT in front of Alice. She put a huge smile across her face with a blush that said almost like a 'shut up lmao'. Ever since then, shes been awkward when saying hi, she doesn't ask me questions in class like she used to, but to me she seems a bit happy or content when I talk to her, although she only really talks to me when we're alone and not around others. Im probably overthinking stuff. I just want to hold her in my arms and never let her go :$. Idk what to do at this point. Help reddit :( \n Edit: Forgot to mention something. While I was at her house, she told me she gets bored of people when she feels there is nothing different about them that differentiates from other people. I asked her why she wasn't bored of me, in which she replied ""Idk you're just pretty funny and stuff"". Im overthinking this all but can you really blame me :((("	known a girl for 2 years, fell for her, she got awkward with me all of a sudden, im stuck.	479	20	askwomenadvice

She preceded to tell me she wants to be up front with guys but she thinks the friend zone is stupid.  She then told me that she just wants to be friends right now. Before I could say anything she then told me that's because she believes for her to date anyone she needs to know said person for 6 months, which then I told her I agree because we first met on valentines day for a blind date.

"Boyfriend and I have been dating for about six months. He's 22M, I'm 23F. \n So far, this relationship has been incredible. I am so completely in love with him. We trust and understand each other to a degree that I had always hoped was possible in a relationship, but never really got until I started dating him. I should also point out that I've only really dated one other person + had a few odd flings here and there, so maybe this is skewing my perspective. My last relationship (which lasted about 9 months, in which we broke up twice) was nowhere near this level of awesome. \n Anyway, this weekend, I started talking about how I wanted to go to grad school next year. He would also graduate by next year. We don't really have a whole lot of plans for our relationship after that, and have both agreed that it probably makes sense for me to choose a good school over attempting to continue our relationship. He also wants to travel a lot, and live ""between"" two cities, so-to-speak (i.e., roughly 4 months in the city he's living in now, 4 months in SF, and the other 4 months travelling/exploring). I recognize that that lifestyle might not make sense for me (since grad school), but I'm open to LD. \n Anyway. All of this is just really annoying because I feel like we're being realistic, but also expecting that our relationship would end at some point. I was actually really upset about this and started crying when we were talking yesterday, and he was really sweet and held me, though did not give me any false hope. \n I'm wondering if it's bad for me to cling on to the (somewhat slim) chance that we could last another few years. I recognize that I want to get married at some point, probably between 27-30. He says he doesn't necessarily need to get married, but would like to have kids--but doesn't see that happening for 'a long time' (and as a result, thinks it's unlikely that we'd still be together by that point). I don't really know what a 'long time' is, and don't know if it would make sense for me to bring it up again. I asked him why he thought we'd break up, and he agreed that the main reason probably would be distance. \n I'm not really sure how to deal with this uncertainty, or even what I want to do about it. To some extent, I think if we tried hard enough, we could make this work--we both generally want to live in the same areas, and have very similar mindsets. One of the grad schools I'm applying to is also in SF (though I'm applying there because I really like the school and the community, not for his sake--even if we weren't dating, I'd still apply there).

I had been dating this girl for a while. But as finals reared its ugly head I decided to back off for a bit and give her some peace and quiet to study. I continued with that through the actual tests the next week. When they were all done I tried to get back to her but through finding out the hard way I learned that she wasn't interested in me anymore and she had begun talking to other people.\n When I talked to her face to face she said that it was because I wasn't able to define our relationship and called it immature because I was never able to explain or talk about my emotions. I know I need to change and I thought maybe y'all had some wise words for a poor sap like me, thanks	lost my best friend because I couldn't show her the emotions I wish I could	139	15	askwomenadvice
I am an atheist and met a cute girl at a local store that said she went to church with the owner. I'm attracted to her but have had bad experiences with girls that are too religious. (Not just Christians. Buddists, Jewish, and various denominations of christians.) Should I try to find out how religious she is before asking her out or just try to deal with it later? \n I am also wondering about the overall opinion of a high school junior dating a freshman. She looks more like a senior but told me she is 15 and a freshman. \n I'm also concerned that if I do ask her out, she would stand me up. I've never actually been on a date because I've been stood up for every date I've ever had (3 different girls that seemed nice enough said yes and then stood me up) and would like to know some way to prevent this. \n Sorry for errors. I am on mobile	if I want to ask a girl out, should I find out how religious she is first? Would it seem creepy if a high school junior asked out a freshman? How do I avoid being stood up?	164	37	askwomenadvice
"I've been talking to this girl at school for a few weeks and maybe 2 weeks in she starts talking about her sex toy. I thought it would be awkward to ask her out because we have class together and would have to work on projects together so I didn't make a move plus she said she just got out of a long relationship and wasn't ready for anything new. \n So we kept talking and her 21st rolled around and I couldn't make it out on her first night out, midnight the night before,  but I offered to go out the next night. I was just making some hamburger helper and said if she wanted some she could stop over kinda joking-because who wants hamburger helper on their 21st birthday dinner!?- and she actually came over before just the two of us went out. When we got back I offered to let her stay but she wanted to go home so she walked home. \n Then a little while later (like a week) I drunk texted her about how great I think she is and she said ""I like you too"" and it was good to know how I felt. Things have been a little bit awkward but she still initiates conversation with me. She's also generally very open about most everything with me. \n What's going on?

First off we're both 17 and have been dating 3 years her parents made us break up so we kept it a secret and then they allowed us again 6months of sneaking and we have been allowed for around 6 now. \n Her parents are bat shit insane and verbally abuse her all the time and she's the punching bag of the family, we can't go on dates because her father won't let us yet it's fuckinng ridiculous. \n Anyways we have an amazing relationship and never fight the only problems are how much she hates her parents. We used to sext all the time and when we were allowed to start dating we had phone sex a lot, as well as when her parents left us alone I would finger her rub her clit and mak her cum a lot and she loves it, in person she is as sexual as it gets wants to do everuthing and is really horny, but a few months ago she stopped wanting to sext but we kept having phone sex and the other night she said she wasn't comfortable with how she sounds on the phone, which I don't understand because she's perfectly fine with me hearing her practically scream in person, so for this last week we haven't done anything sexual on the phone and sometimes she says she wants to later that night but when it's time she doesn't feel like it. \n She came without me one day when I was literally asking to cum with her and she said she didn't feel like it. So I'm just confused ladies because in person she's all over me on the phone almost non existent, can someone explain this to me? And by the way we haven't had sex but we have tried but didn't have time we have gone to oral numerous times though	she used to like to have phone sex and real sex now only real sex	311	15	askwomenadvice
"I really want to have a threesome. They seem like they could be lots of fun. Personally, I'd be into either MMF or FFM, but my fiance is 100% not up for MMF. I brought this up with him a few months ago, and he said that he was into it too. So, the next challenge was finding someone we'd both want to have sex with. \n I've never identified as bi, but I've kissed a few women, and I'm definitely attracted to some. After some discussion, we settled on a friend that we're both attracted to, but I'm not sure how to bring this up. If she's not into it, I don't want it to be awkward afterwards. My fiance has hung out with her more than I have, because I've been a complete hermit for the past 6 months trying to finish up grad school, but I feel like I would rather be approached by the girl if it were me. \n This is definitely something we both want, but I know that a lot of women probably wouldn't be interested in being the third, and I really don't want her to feel like the ""third wheel."" We aren't interested in any kind of poly relationship, but it seems stupid to have a threesome if you aren't all committed to making it enjoyable for everyone. \n Honestly, I think her pleasure would be more important to me than mine or my fiance's, and I'm definitely ok with them kissing/penetration. I wouldn't want to ruin the fun with crazy rules like ""no touching the man you're in a threesome with."" If she's into it, would it be weird to sit down and talk about what she likes and is interested in? I wouldn't want it to seem like an interrogation lol. \n Most approaches we've come up with involve drunkenly joking about threesomes (in general) and seeing how she reacts. \n About us: We're all in our 20s, fiance and I have been together for 2.5 years, and we've known our friend (who is single) the entire time"	best way to approach a (female) friend for an FFM threesome	344	11	askwomenadvice
"F/26] I've been single for almost a year now after a long long term relationship. And I keep falling into the same situation. I ""date"" someone for a few months, it fizzles, I'm single for a few months, repeat. I'm very open sexually so I don't feel used by any means. I practice safe, consensual sex. \n Each time it fizzles, it's usually because the relationship isn't established. I get choked up and terrified to ask: what are your intentions with this? Is this more than a physical relationship? So I chicken out, and we gradually stop talking because I back out slowly. \n My current situation is especially different. The [M/30]an I'm seeing (3 months) is incredibly sexually compatible with me. We have all the same kinks and mesh together extremely well. I'm starting to develop some pretty deep feelings despite the fact that we don't ""go out"". For context: We usually hang out 1-2 times a week, at our neighborhood bar, do the deed, cuddle and watch tv, type thing. We don't text each other all the time, maybe every other day, and it's not always about sex. We both work in the the service industry (food/retail) so our schedules don't mesh as much as I'd like, but there have been times post 13 hr day that he's made time to hang out with me. When we're together, he's affectionate and attentive. He does show me with his actions that this could be more. He also hasn't been in a relationship in 4+ years so I don't want to pressure him (or myself for that matter). Also, we are exclusive. \n Here's where I am having a hard time: I can't seem to muster the courage to ask the questions I mentioned before.  I seriously have the yips because of how much it's been consuming my thoughts lately. Because of the nature of our kinks, theres a lot of trust, honesty and communication, but I can't seem to ask, ""if this is more than just sex"". \n How do you ask these things? How do you overcome the fear of the feelings not being reciprocated? I don't want the situation to change per se, I'm okay with what we're doing, and the pace at which it's going, I just want to know  what  we're doing exactly. \n I also feel like this is just a vicious cycle I keep finding myself in... Is this dating? Or do I need to make adjustments to change the cycle? I've recognized that the common denominator is me... \n Any help or suggestions is appreciated.

F20) (Friendship) best friend of mine slipped up, slept with someone I cared about and made a mess of the whole situation and did so behind my back, I had to guess that it was happening to even get her to tell me. She was basically inexperienced with guys, she knew that by sleeping with this guy it'd upset me and she thought she could let it blow over and never tell me. \n Anywho.. I forgave her because I genuinely was over it, but I keep getting this nagging feeling that, if she's gone behind my back with someone before, getting caught the first time isn't going to stop her doing it again should she slip into the wrong situation. I keep wondering why I begin to feel so shit some nights and it's because this thought of her possibly getting close to yet another guy I was intimately close with, pops into my head, and it makes me wonder if she is silly enough to try it again or if she genuinely got stuck in a bad position the first time and is sorry :/	friend went behind my back, turns out I'm not over it, damaged trust issues	186	14	askwomenadvice
"I don't know how to begin so I'm just going to dive right into this. a little about me, I'm a 26 year old male who is thrilled about life. I am the first person in my family to graduate university (with a very specialized degree) and now have a fantastic job with my degree. As a whole I don't think I could be much happier. However, due to my upbringing, focus on school (7 full years of university), and the fact that I worked 3 jobs to ensure I graduated with no debt.

I know so many people will just say ""go for it"" but it's just not that simple for me (I was one of those kids whose parents and sibling constantly teased him when it came to girls - perhaps that's why I have this problem). Also how does one do it in a way that doesn't come off as ""creepy"" - I'm by no means a creepy guy, but oddly enough I've been called one solely for pulling a chair out for a girl who's hands were full so she could sit down (the girl didn't call me a creep (infact she seemed surprised), but another one at the table did). \n I'm also really not into trying to meet people online, I would much rather try to meet women in person and try to ""better myself"" \n feel free to pm me, if you want to discuss this outside of the thread"	sheltered guy wants to know how to approach women in public (or anywhere for the matter).	313	16	askwomenadvice

She then texted me back, asking if I wanted to go to a ""haunted hayride"" and corn-maze on Friday. I immediately agreed, not really thinking. \n Everyone seems to think this is a bad idea. I'm sure her boyfriend will be there, and my friend is worried I might take it hard seeing them together (I've not met him, they only started dating shortly after I moved to the area, before we had really talked). \n Now, for better or worse, I  am  in love with this woman. I don't know  why , but she completely lights up my world. While it's definitely easier to say ""just find someone else"" -- and I'm certainly  trying  to meet other people -- the fact is, I would rather wait for her and it not work out, than just have  no  hope. \n Should I just back away, and keep it purely to messaging and texting, unless she breaks up with him?

m38, f40)\nMy fiance and I have been engaged for over two years and had planned to get married in May of 2015 (now 2016). I say planned loosely as we never sat an actual date. Her reason was it was just going to be the two of us and most likely a beach wedding package in the Caribbean or something so no need to discuss it or anything. When I would bring up setting a date so we could book things and request time off of work she would get upset and say I was rushing her. \n My reason for writing is that in the past few months she has given her ring back to me after any type of argument and stormed out and gone home. Usually it's me that plays peace maker and tries to reconcile things. This last time she called and said she never wanted the ring back and thinks engagement rings are stupid and just a way to control women (never spoke like this before) and that she never wanted a nice ring anyway and all I cared about was material possessions and that's why I bought her the ring I did. I said that wasn't the case and that the ring is the one we picked out together and that I felt honored to be able to save and buy you the ring you said you wanted. She again said it held no meaning to her and was just a material possession. \n To me she seems like she is on the edge of a breakdown, she found out recently that her dad may be cheating on her mom and said its causing her to go crazy. I told her I would be there for her and want to be but damn, how much BS do I have to put up with to be supportive. To her being supportive is putting up with anything she does and says until she is past this. Almost as if it gives her free range to act how she wants. \n So what do you think, do you give your fiance his ring back, insult it and then say you want to stay together and maybe get married one day in the future? I don't know if this is something I need to stick out or cut ties from. \n Sorry for the rambling and poor grammar this just happened a few moments ago and I'm still shocked	fiance gives rings back a lot and now insults it and says she never wants to see it again	408	19	askwomenadvice
Bit of background. \n Okay so I have this friend who's a girl that's giving me all the signs of being interested. We both became friends a few months back nearly a year. She introduced me to her friend and we dated a while but it fizzled out and visa versa with her and my friend nothing serious just a few dates. \n We carried on talking, became very close friends and go out for meals once or twice a week, we laugh, joke, make rude but playful comments, flirt but it's always on the unspoken understanding we are off limits to each other. We never asked each other out or even spoke about it in detail because of the history. Recently she gets very annoyed if I show interest in other girls and border line jealous. \n Tonight she was a lot more flirty after dinner as i drove her home and even asked me leading questions around how I would win her over and how would I get her to sleep with me.  I made a joke about it but she seemed annoyed I didn't pursue it or try it on with her. \n I do like her and think we would get on as a relationship very well but... \n \n I'm not sure if I should make a move even though all the signs are there as we are such good friends and often use the friendship for support. If I'm wrong and I read the signs wrong I risk the friendship. \n The history between dating best friends although not serious makes it a bit awkward in my own head if it did happen. \n \n Should I just ask her out or make it a move one night and try my luck forgetting the past? \n Or \n Leave it and try to enjoy the friendship	friend get very flirty with me and annoyed I didn't make a move even though we have history with other friends not sure if I should go for it with her.	301	31	askwomenadvice

Not really a relationship question, but apparently /r/askwomen doesn't want me clogging up the endless queue of questions like 'why don't women like X?' \n So yeah, a friend of ours from college called up my husband and said we need to see his new place, which is about 2 hours away from us. I like this guy, but hes pretty much an alcoholic that hasn't hit rock bottom yet. He's 30 years old and still clings to the 'woohoo parrtayy!!' days of college. Every time we see him, this guy encourages us to binge drink along side him. Pre-pregnancy I'd be more than happy to get shit faced, but now I'm pregnant so no-go on any drinking for me. \n Heres my problem; I don't want to go and watch my husband and our friend get shitty drunk while I'm stone cold sober. However, I can't send my husband by himself because he legitimately can't drive at night (some manner of night blindness). We can't ask our friend to come visit us, because the entire point of this trip is to see his new place. However I don't want to tell my husband no, we're not going, because that's kinda shitty/selfish and I hate the idea of my pregnancy inhibiting his or our social life. But I really, really, REALLY cannot stand being around drunk people whilst sober; and trust me, they will get stupid drunk together. \n So, wat do? \n On one hand, I could use the excuse that we have to get up early for a prenatal Dr. appt in the morning and then head out to my father's holiday memorial service later in the day (all true) so we should stay home and get a good night's sleep. However I hate being punk ass, and we haven't seen this guy in ages because its hard to get our schedules aligned. If we turn down this trip, I have no idea when we'll see him again. \n If he lived closer I wouldn't be so torn, but a two hour drive is a commitment, and I feel like we'd have to at least spend a few hours there socializing. So I'd get home from work, we'd probably leave around 7pm, get there at 9pm, if we spent 3 hours there we wouldn't get home until 2am. \n All of this sounds terrible, but equally, I hate being a bad friend/hermit/recluse simply because I'm pregnant. \n UUGGH, what would you guys do? \n And no, there's no	its in the title.	412	4	askwomenadvice

Okay, so my story starts about a year ago. I was talk to my friends girlfriend randomly one night, let's call her Katrina, and we hit it off as friends. Fastfoward 2 weeks later and we start talking about sexual shit, then we start sexting and stuff the next week. This continues for months while she still has a boyfriend. About 3 months ago, we actually hooked up. Then again about a month and a half ago. Then, a month ago, my bestfriend of 4 years admits that she has feelings for me and wants to hook up (she also has a boyfriend), let's call her Zoey. So me and Zoey hang out one night and both of us really want to do something, but are hesitant and nothing ends up happening. So we plan to hang out again and actually do something. But, the day that we were supposed to hang out, she flips her shit and decides she wants to stay with her boyfriend. I started to have feels for her and that crushed me. Then, the day after that, Katrina apparently broke down and told her boyfriend EVERYTHING. And says that me and her can't do anything. But the week before she spilled her heart out and admitted that she really liked me and all the things girls say when they mean it. And I responded my admitting my love for her and such. What do I do now? Zoey won't really even speak to me anymore because she doesn't want to like me. And Katrina and I still speak and see eachother every day, but its really awkward. How do I handle this?	My closest female friends fell in love with me but decided they wanted to stay with their boyfriends.	277	18	needadvice
"Disclaimer: I initially wanted to make this post to /r/offmychest but couldn't find the ""submit a thread"" option there and decided this subreddit would do just as well. \n For the past 8 months my brother has been an absolute nightmare to live with. In the morning he will deliberately take too long of a shower to screw up everyone else's schedule, pulls his car up right in front of the garage door so that those who park inside the garage door can't leave before him. He also slams the front door with all of his might (basically I get an alarm clock 3 times in the morning from him), he stomps around the house in steel toe construction boots at all hours of the night and morning making as much noise as possible. He does all of these things to try and goad a confrontation where he will sit there and scream and shout, immediately followed by him bawling uncontrollably. He lashes out at our mother frequently and without reason, including her asking him how his day was, or doing his laundry and him ""losing"" a lighter. \n He has had times where he reverts to his old sociable self, but they last maybe a week or two every 3 months. The problem is that even in those ""lucid"" days you still can't talk to him about his problems because he simply reverts back to a man possessed. On Black Friday (November 27) he and I got into literally our first fight of our lives, the reason? he was livid that the graham crackers might go stale.

There is no talking to him, any sort of conversation during one of these confrontations basically goes as follows: Him hurling insults and generally being belligerent until you shout back at him, at that point he will run for the nearest exit to the house screaming ""you don't even f***ing listen I'M NOT CRAZY AND I'M NOT A SPAZ"". Nobody in our home has ever referred to him as crazy, a spaz, or anything of the sort. The closest anyone has gotten to that was me pleading with him to seek professional help as he was trying to punch me. He is hearing us say things we clearly aren't, he sits in one of the two rooms of the house with his things and sits there talking quite loudly to himself, every other word is f###ing as he rants about how nobody listens to or cares about him. He will repeatedly walk behind me, as my computer is sitting right in front of one of his rooms that houses a bunch of rocks and power tools, while muttering about how he should just punch my face in for tackling him like I did. \n Our fathers side has a history of being genuinely awful people, as far as I know none of them have been diagnosed with anything though it certainly wouldn't surprise me. The other option as I see it is that when he got a head injury about a year ago it did something to his brain and this is the way he is now. At this point I don't think it really matters what the cause is. \n We literally can't talk to him about this without him flying off the handle and going apeshit. Is there anything we can do, or do I need to try and convince my mother that maybe he needs to no longer be here?"	My brother is driving everyone off the wall and refuses any aid.

My life since early adolescence has been a struggle. My home life as a kid was awful, including so much verbal & emotional abuse at the hands of my batshit mom & alcoholic stepdad as well as sexual abuse from another kid at one point. I spent years self harming, binge drinking and eating, and attempting suicide. I met a boy and now I'm a bit happier. Happy enough to try and get help. My GP gave me an SSRI and told me to book a therapist so I can stop the meds soon. My therapist told me to try breathing exercises. \n My initial reaction to my therapist is anger. I don't think my problems are as simple as breathing, mindfulness. I've tried those methods independently and while they can help, they are not a cure. This SSRI is helping for now, but I don't want to go back to the life I was leading before. Even with my SO, even with the antidepressant, life is a struggle for me. I'm tired of struggling. What do I do? I feel like I want an actual diagnosis or a root cause, but my therapist is saying she sees no personality or mood disorder. \n Here are some of my symptoms for reference: \n \n dissociation/depersonalization/derealization \n panic attacks \n constant anxiety over 1 billion little things \n low self esteem  \n self hatred \n suicidal thoughts \n racing thoughts \n insomnia at times, sleeping too much at others \n inability to keep to a schedule \n brain fog \n cant enjoy anything \n short attention span and memory  \n constantly tired \n paranoia  \n super impulsive at times  \n self destructive urges \n hypersensitivity  \n extremely insecure \n \n Help.	my GP gave me an SSRI on the condition I go to therapy, my therapist thinks all I need is the power of positive thinking and mindfulness coping skills. I don't agree and feel there's something deeper.	267	37	needadvice
I don't know if this is the right place to post this but I just sort of need to get it out in writing and hopefully get some advice from people who have gone through or are going through or hell even will be going through a similar situation. \n My friends want to get an apartment off-campus for next year which is something that I've been considering for a while too. We found a rather nice place that includes all utilities and furniture and is fairly new (I think it opened up last spring). \n I really want to do this but it is all riding on my financial aid. I usually get enough to cover all of my expenses which includes living on campus and then a small refund check back once everything has been paid for. I've been told by the financial aid office that the amount of money that I am offered does not depend on whether or not I live on-campus. \n I brought up the idea to my parents while I was home for the holidays and they seemed alright with it though my friends and I hadn't found a place to start looking into. After talking to the leasing office yesterday, one of my friends did his background check immediately. Now I feel like I'm stuck and I don't know what to do. I really want to have a place that is kind of my own but I feel like everything is sort of happening rather quick and like my parents will be upset that I've not talked about this more with them which would be totally understandable. \n I'm just worried and scared. One moment I feel as if everything will work out exactly as it needs to and then the next moment I start worrying about the entire situation. I just do not want to get in over my head and royally screw everything up.	Friends want to get an apartment. I want to get an apartment with them.

My job is to plan and delegate tasks to an off site group of 5 people. \n I found out the following disturbing news about the lead of my team and I don't know how to proceed.... \n \n He works off the clock (daily and has been for months) \n \n He asked one of the female team members out, when she turned him down, he went to his lead and lied and said she called him a rapist and was then made the lead of said team. \n \n Since the interaction I mentioned in #2 he has been passive aggressive towards her in ways that negatively impacts her work (not answering questions, lying to management about her performance, etc.) \n \n \n My job isn't to get involved, but I feel like if I'm not part of the solution, I'm part of the problem and I absolutely cannot abide that. How should I proceed? Do I reach out to their on site manager? Do I reach out to the individual in question directly? Should I talk to my lead (who is also involved with them) and see what he thinks I should do? \n All advice is welcome. TIA.

So I've been working at a video game store for the last 3 years. I am now one of the most experienced there besides the manager since I worked roughly 30 hours a week(granted it's a part time job for whe. I was in high school and I know it's a lot of hours but I maintained a high average, besides the point) I am now down with school till September and will be quitting anyways. I don't have a lot of money for school, really any, but am trying to save so I asked for more hours at least 35-40. The past few weeks has been slipping and I'm now getting 27, no one else is getting my shifts or anything they just aren't there. I need more money so I can save and still live.  I get payed 14 cents more than minimum wage so it's not a lot at all. I'm debating on finding a new job that either pays more or can consistently give more hours, both is better of course. My boss is a great guy so I don't want to screw him over and I feel bad for even thinking of leaving to find something else because of this. Talking him to increase hours works but gradually starts to slide down to lower amounts after 2-3 months. \n Just a bit torn I guess, any suggestions are welcome.	boss is cutting my hours, no reasoning behind it just not as many shifts.

"So, yeah, I just lost my SSN card. I always carried it around in my wallet because I just forgot to take it out. I DO remember my number fully now, so I don't know why I kept it around, I just did. \n I lost it sometime this week, either Tuesday or Monday. The area I keep it in, is the same area I keep my CostCo Card to fill gas up, and where I keep a ""Free Meal"" card I got from my Job. I either lost it at work, or at the CostCo gas station. \n I'm going to ask my manager tomorrow if anyone found it at work, I'm not very hopeful though. \n I'm just wondering if this is actually a problem I should be worried about? They'd only have my Full Name and my SSN. I don't have any loans, I do have multiple Credit Cards and a Bank, but none of them should release any info on my card with just my SSN and Name right? They wouldn't have my account numbers/card numbers, my Date of Birth, or my Address right, making it relatively useless for them to even attempt to get any info from them? \n My parents told me they could try and use my SSN to work under my name at a job, but don't employers have to check that the SSN being used matches the ID of the person applying for a job? \n All in all, soon as I can I'm stopping by the Social Security Administration to get my new card, and I will be report my lost card to a Credit Agency to ensure there's records of potential fraud, but after that's all said and done... \n Is this anything to lose sleep about? Should I actively worry about anything?"

I'm sure this comes from my low self-esteem, and a little bit of social anxiety. I just don't feel that I'm good enough. I honestly feel sub-human. It's not even like I'm a terrible person. I just cannot be content with myself. I'm constantly looking for validation, and trying to please everyone. Every time I fuck up, it brings me down 10 notches. \n I'm not normal. I don't really have hobbies, other than Netflix, Reddit, and reading about self-improvement. I don't hang out with anyone. Rarely get out of the house. I look miserable no matter where I go. No job, not in school. My life is so pathetic, I shouldn't be alive. I'm sure another soul could have utilized my life 100x better. \n I don't trust anyone, and it just adds onto my problems, and honestly the thing is, I can't trust anyone. Literally everyone around me is two faced. I don't know if it's because I'm not that important or significant of a friend that they feel they can talk shit about me to others or I'm just a piece of shit and they don't give a fuck about me anyway. I feel like the biggest inside joke in my community, and that's probably 100% true...	How do I be content with my thoughts and actions, without relying on others for validation and appeasement.

I'm an 18 year old girl in college. I just started a few months ago and I've already made many friends. But I've a problem. \n There's this guy in my class, (let's call him V). V wouldn't talk much in the beginning but now he's made a few friends. But he's also very creepy. Even my girl friends think so. V keeps staring at us and turns every single thing someone says into something incredibly sexual and creepy. He also seems to be following us wherever we go. \n Now the worst thing is that I'm stuck with him in this group project we have to do and he is the laziest motherfucker on the planet. He didn't do any of the work and I talked about it to my professor but he wouldn't change my partner. I don't know why but for some fucking reason my friends have started teasing me with this guy, because he talks more about me and keeps staring at me. I told them to stop and they agreed to never mention it again, but then they start it again. V knows about this but he seems to be enjoying it. He keeps texting me all day to try and talk to me but I don't want to. \n What do I do?	Friends tease me about a creepy guy that I don't like and they won't stop.	216	15	needadvice
"Title basically describes it. I moved away from an emotionally and psychologically abusive person a while ago but into a place where it was not really healthy for me to recover from anyway. As in, I had no privacy, no room or door, no space all while continuing a crucial transfer semester at a community college, finding a new job, and immediately assuming a babysitting position for 5 younger siblings. \n My friends are two towns away and the new job I have has been extremely poor for both my emotional sense of self and payment wise.

"I am a pre-med student and maintaining my GPA is really important for me. At the beginning of this past quarter, I was enrolled in 5 classes (all rigorous upper division science classes), and working 80 hours a month. My school has a deadline to change your grading option from ""graded"" to ""pass/no pass,"" and due to having a lot on my plate, I switched my grading option in one of my classes to P/NP right at the deadline. However, I ended up working hard in the class, starting to really love the material, and aced all of the exams. Now I am in a dilemma because I would have received an A for the class, but will only end up having a ""P"" on my academic record. I am currently in the process of writing a petition to change the grading option back from P/NP to graded. I talked to an academic advisor and they said that the petition is unlikely to be approved as the university holds the grading deadline to ensure that no grade manipulation can occur (if I got a C, I would take the pass, and if I got an A, I would switch the option to have it positively impact my GPA). I have to write a statement of why I want this grade to be changed, can any of you redditors help me frame my statement in a convincing way to avoid the ""grade-manipulation"" vibe?

23 year old, single, male here. I dropped out of uni after a semester at the age of 19. Between the ages of 19 and 22, I managed to put myself in some debt (maybe $6k) and destroy my credit (which I am working on fixing). I don't receive support from my family, and have been living a financially independent life since the age of 19. \n I've been at my current job for almost two years. Its an office job for a mortgage servicing company. I started as a temp doing data processing, and was promoted to a team lead after one year. For only having my high school diploma, this job pays well (~$26k salaried, plus paid vacation/sick days and amazing benefits) and lets me live a comfortable life. I spend my free time doing the things I LOVE, the things I am PASSIONATE about (producing EDM and DJing amongst other things). However, my work life itself is boring/uninteresting to me. I receive no feedback from my boss... unless it is a coaching, which I won't receive until its about too late (this issue has been addressed, has not been changed).

I'm 28 years old and have pretty much been codependent on my parents all my life. I can be considered naive and am learning about pretty much everything that was not taught to me. I went along with their plans for me to go to college and follow that whole trajectory. Well, it didn't work out as planned and I racked up over $100K in student loans and am without a degree. I do have more than half the amount of credits needed to graduate though, but it'll cost me about $35K more just to complete. I already looked into transferring to cheaper schools just to finish but it became a whole convoluted mess and will most likely cost the same amount. \n I work full-time and I've been paying about $1,600/month for minimum payments on all the loans and currently live at home.

Hi all, \n So I just moved into a new place with 3 other people. One of them, let's say Sean, is having his recently-homeless friend (Jack) stay with us for a couple months. Sean is paying a bit extra for an office, and having Jack stay in the office so it's not like he is impeding on anyone's space. Jack himself is a pretty friendly guy, made a great first impression, but clearly going through a lot right now and taking it out on the world. He stole a roommate's weed, he drank over half a bottle of good bourbon I had, and has been constantly taking everyone's food (and possibly some money that went missing). Today, I got home to find my Ativan (need it for anxiety, but it gets you fucked up if abused) missing. He's also made some pretty sketchy comments about sharing my bed since he doesn't have a mattress. \n All of the roommates agreed that he had to go, but Sean unfortunately got really sick and has been in the hospital for a week, heavily drugged, and won't be back in action for another week at least. The other two roommates (a couple) are going on holiday for a week. I can't stand him being in my apartment alone with me for another week, but don't have anywhere else to stay. I'm afraid he'll steal anything of value if left alone. I know in the past he was violent when drunk, and I'm honestly scared he might try to force himself on me. I'm a foot shorter and half his weight. How do I get rid of Jack?	creepy emotionally unstable guy is stealing stuff, I want him gone.

There is a man that has been harassing me on a biweekly basis and I can't take it anymore. He works in the same office building as my therapist, whom I see three times a week, and since he takes his lunch break at the same time that I get there to see her, I end up being forced to put up with him. \n I started going to therapy because I struggle with self-esteem and confidence. I've been bullied most of my life and it's taken its toll on me, and in the last year I've become incredibly meek. It's already difficult for me to go to therapy because I have to face aspects of my past and myself that are uncomfortable for me, so it's very annoying that he's making it more difficult for me. Also, I want to be able to focus on the things that are important rather than thinking about him during my session. \n There are many people who I see on a regular basis while I'm sitting in the waiting area, and everyone else just nods, says hello, or says nothing at all and leaves it at that. This man, however, refuses to leave me be. It started when he asked me, after noticing that I'm there on a regular basis, what I'm doing there. I didn't want to tell him that I'm going to therapy because it's none of his business. I didn't really know what to say, so I just smiled. Now I suspect I've become a sort of enigma to him. I'm a young, relatively attractive woman, and he's obviously taken great interest in me. He now makes it a point to do anything he can to get my attention. He knows when I'll be there and comes out at the same time everyday and makes a fuss in front of me. He says very odd things to me that don't make sense, makes loud noises, and sighs loudly when I won't talk to him. Last week, he brought out all of his paperwork to the little coffee table that was directly in front of me and packed up his briefcase in front of me before leaving, and then stopped at the top of the stairs to look over his shoulder, sigh loudly, and mumble something at me. \n Today, he was waiting on a lower floor and when I walked by and saw him, I decided to wait on the floor above where I normally sit to avoid him. He followed me upstairs, though, and I ended up hiding in the women's bathroom to stay away from him. Then, he followed me back downstairs when it was time for my appointment, and started making loud noises to get my attention. \n I often arrive at therapy 10 minutes early so I can gather my thoughts and wind down from my journey, and I would like to be able to sit in peace in the waiting room without being harassed by some strange man.	A man is harassing me while I wait to see my therapist, with whom I'm trying to work on my self-esteem and confidence, and I've had enough of it.

I have a very cooperative relationship and 50/50 custody with my son's father. And that about covers it. \n But I feel like the weight of the world is on my soul. Every choice I make, everything I do, I wonder how someone in my life would tell me I did it wrong. I glare at every ""imperfect"" decision I make and think of all the ways my family or friends would tell me it was wrong. \n If I decide to sleep in for an extra 30 minutes and be late for work, I can't because I just go over in my mind how I would be chastised for being irresponsible or wrong. \n If I choose to smoke a bowl in my bathroom with the vent on while my son is asleep in his room across the house, I feel deeply guilty and can almost hear my mother or my ex husband or someone else telling me what a fucked up parent I am. \n It's heavy. \n And I'm tired of not feeling ok with the choices I make, even if they aren't the perfect ones. \n I don't know if it comes from a place of over self-criticism, never really having a true support system, or something else entirely. \n I know I have a lifetime of issues I need to work out, but this constant heavy sense of not being good enough is somewhat new.

I don't know how to get my dad to therapy. He's been depressed for what we think might be close to a decade. I think it first started about a decade ago when one of my dad's friends died after leaving a party at my parents house while drunk and drove into a barrier on the highway.\nThis led my dad into a severe depression and he has been heavily heavily drinking ever since. He displayed all the terrible behaviors with alcoholism; spending crazy amounts at bars and casinos, driving home drunk, missing work, etc. \n My mom divorced my dad a couple years ago while I was still in college and my sister in high school. He refused help or counseling and she couldn't take it anymore. My dad took the divorce VERY badly. He refused to go to couples counseling or anything of the sort. After my mom left I was the one who had to make sure he got in bed when he came home in the mornings wasted. I've cleaned up his shit off his face after he shit himself on the floor of the bathroom and passed out in it. I've cleaned wounds after he's fallen coming in the house. I cleaned vomit. I physically carried him to bed. It was mentally taxing. All the while he refused to go to counseling. Refused help. Refused to talk about it. Swore up and down and begged me to believe that he was trying to get better. I was young and inexperienced in anything like this so I just put up with it. My mom had no clue how to help me since she couldn't do anything herself while they were married. I eventually stopped calling her for help. \n I graduated college and moved into my own apartment. My sister, now in college, is still with him. He's acting the exact same way he was and my poor sister is left doing my job. I feel awful for leaving her there but i don't know what to do. I did the same thing my mom did. I left. \n Over thanksgiving weekend i had to leave work to bail my dad out of jail after he got pulled over for drinking and driving. On the drive home he told me he wanted to kill himself and that my sister and i would be better off with his money than with him alive. That night i took him to a 24hr mental facility to start the process of getting therapy. I sat there for three hours while he was being examined. I didn't go in and he didn't talk to me about it after. He told me he scheduled a follow up with a therapist. Two months later and he hasn't gone. Refuses to talk about. And last night my sister called me in the middle of a panic attack because she brought some friends home and found him passed out in the bathroom covered in shit. The bathroom was destroyed. I had to bring her and the dogs to my apartment to calm her down. I drove all her friends home. \n I need help. I've taken him to the facility. I told him I would take him to his appointments, but he lied about scheduling them. The one night he said he had an appointment he avoided all my calls and showed up at his house at eleven fucking drunk. \n Please help. We don't know what to do.	Father refuses to get help for his alcoholism and depression. This has led my mother to divorce him and leave me and my sister to take care of him when he comes home wasted talking about suicide. How do we get him to get help without the use of police at the risk of him losing his job? We're desperate.	579	60	needadvice
"I'm a 26 year old who has always felt ""behind"" in milestones compared to my peers.  (For example, I don't know how to get a job, and I've only had 2 interviews in my life)  I've been diagnosed with a few mental illnesses (BPD, Bipolar, Anxiety Disorder, ADD) and I don't know if they are where my difficulties lie, or if it's something else.   My mother went to school to work with people with developmental disabilities and after college she told me ""I don't know, I really do think you're on the spectrum"" but never went into detail [we don't have the closest relationship] and I mean, I have friends who are on the spectrum and friends who have kids on it and I see similarities with communication difficulties and I just ..

Hello r/needAdvice, I've been going to see my Psychiatrist who has been prescribing me medication without any real diagnosis. He simply prescribes me the medication because I have trouble focusing. That is pretty much the only reason he will give them to me. Is this a valid enough reason? There's no real diagnosis as to why I am taking them. \n I decided to get a second opinion in terms of my conditions but that Psychiatrist is also just doing the same thing. I wanted to get a full diagnosis so I can understand what I'm tackling as well as the fact that my insurance company will not cover the medication unless it were under a diagnosis. \n So is this a normal thing that Psychiatrist do? Is this not unethical or somewhat illegal?	Being prescribed medication for focus but no diagnosis, is this ethical and legal? If so, whats the rationale behind this and why do this?	132	24	needadvice
I had a very close friend from 2010 up until January of last year. A couple months prior to falling out I had began to come to terms with my sexuality and I started seeing someone (whom I'm still with today). My friend was one of the first people I told and he was nothing but supportive of everything. I started investing so much of my time into my relationship that I didn't speak to my friends very much since this is my very first serious relationship and my partner never wanted me to lose touch with my friends. \n About a month after my relationship began, my friend had tried contacting me a few times and I would keep the conversations quick and seem disinterested. One night I wound up hanging up on him on the phone and this is what started the falling out. He wouldn't return my calls or messages until about a month later and essentially told me that he was still happy for me and wished me the best, but I hurt him and he was pissed off at me and he then deleted me off social networks. \n I tried calling him about a year ago and he never returned my call and I left him a brief voicemail explaining I was sorry and wanted to try to talk things out. \n I'm more so looking for advice here on what I can do because I feel responsible for what happened and it continues to bother me everyday that our friendship went the route that it did. He was one of my only friends that was in the same career path I was in and we always shared insight and things about the industry together. Mostly I genuinely miss being friends with him and want him to be a part of my life again.	I fell out with a very close friend because I began my first serious relationship and shut out all of my friends. I wish to reconnect after nearly two years.	307	30	needadvice
"Long story short, I'm what every parent fears to have. A 24 year old pothead guy who's never had a job. I sat around trying to self medicate hoping that i could break free from the depression and anxiety that's been building up since my childhood. That made it impossible for me to get a job which made me more depressed and unmotivated. It resulted in me dropping out of high school and failing out of college. Its so bad that I cant talk to anyone outside of my grandma and 2 good friends and its getting harder to talk to them too. I developed an eating disorder a year ago and it took my depression and made it infinitely worse, it caused me to have verbally violent mood swings and get a fissure. That pain stressed me out to the point where I was always spewing ""kill me"" and ""life is meaningless"" speech openly at home and begging my family(nicest 80 something year old grandparents in the world) to kill me. \n Eventually my mood swings got worse to the point where they had to give up trying on me at home and I don't blame them one bit. They sent me to a mental hospital that did nothing for me and i was homeless when I got out. Again, all well deserved aside from how much they're still trying to help me as much as they can when they have so little to spare. I don't deserve that kindness at all. \n But now, I'm even worse off than before. Now everyday is either hysterical crying or i'm quiet and stressing to death 24/7. I need a job crucially but I have no experience, skills, transportation, or enough social skills to sound mentally competent. I'm really at the point where if i could, I'd kill myself. The only reason I don't is because I'm afraid of failure and don't have a gun. I was lucky enough to get to live with my friend until i get on my feet but right now its looking like I'm probably gonna rot away under a bridge unless I can snap my fingers and suddenly reverse a lifetime of built up depression and anxiety that shifts on bipolar levels. I have no fucking clue where to start. \n When I first got to my friend's house, he said he was gonna try to get me a job at his family's restaurant. Things looked promising at first because I was gonna get to have my first working experience with my friend and people that I at least kind of know but after about a month (while I was recovering from surgery) its not looking good because they cant really squeeze me in. That fizzled out pretty much any hope I had and now i'm in constant fear i'll never be anything because i'm so immature mentally that I can't do anything without someone practically holding my hand the whole way. I wish it was as simple as just manning up and going out and applying for the jobs but i have no confidence or charisma or the ability to 'fake it till i make it' because I literally have no skills at all. I've never felt more defeated in my life and what hurts the most is that I saw all this coming years in advance but couldn't do anything to stop it."	I spent my whole life doing nothing but developing mental issues. I wanna fix my life so that everyone who has tried to help me hasn't wasted their time and limited resources. I wanna be on my own but I'm an adult child basically who has no clue how.	567	49	needadvice
Shes 44, female, worked overseas for 4.5 years. \n Shes always pissed when someone don't get her point, and it's like it's impossible for her to be assertive.

In a few days I'll be staying at my brother's apartment for the first time, because he lives in the same city as a convention I am going to. \n Now, he and his girlfriend (who I adore) have three cats and whenever the two of them have come to visit us, they smelled  very strongly  and unpleasantly like cat. Their luggage, their clothes, they themselves... it's pretty bad, especially for a non cat-owner like me. We have broached the topic with them, but they are very insistent that it's not the cats we are smelling but instead the scent of the air freshener they use to stop the cat smell. *shrugs* \n Anyway, I will be staying with them for a few days. I am looking forward to it, but I am very worried that after having spent the night there that I will spend all day at the convention smelling like they do.

I dated a girl for 6 months.  She ended it 3 months ago.   We work in the same company and share many social circles.  She proposed we stay friends, which we have to an extent (grabbing lunch at work on occasion, short text conversations every week or so etc).  This hasnt been enough for me; she knows how I feel and always avoids that topic of discussion.  Yet our conversations, when they do exist, are always pleasant and mutually enjoyable (I can still make her laugh, and I can differentiate a real smile from a fake one). \n When asking mutual friends for advice, half tell me to be persistent and keep pursuing her.  She responds to about half of my invitations, ghosts me for the rest.  The other half of our friends say I should move on.  I've been going on many dates lately with other women, though none intrigue me the same way.  When I'm with these other girls I can momentarily take my mind off of Sarah but the feeling is always fleeting. \n I understand I have a problem.  I think about her all the time, literally dozens of times per day.  My performance at work is suffering.  When she doesn't write back, I have unhealthy habits like checking her work schedule online, checking social media, inviting mutual friends out (hoping they are spending time with her when we will be meeting up).  The entirety of my being is focused on either talking with her, finding out why she doesnt respond, and as a last ditch effort finding another woman to spend the evening with so I dont wake up alone yet again.  It hasnt gotten to the point where Im camped outside her apartment, but in the digital sense that's exactly what I'm doing and I cant do anything to make it stop.  What is the next step? fwiw cutting her out completely isnt feasible given work and social constraints.

"There's this recurring, if sometimes unstated, notion in discussions on movies/music/books/hobbies/other pastimes or culture that everything can be divided into ""good"" things and ""bad"" things, and that the ""bad"" things can only possibly be liked by those who are unintelligent or otherwise broken or deficient in some way.  I don't know if the things I like or the things I do would be what a smart person would like or do and I worry that I like/dislike the ""wrong"" things.

My roommate, Amanda, and I lived alone together in this apartment complex last year. Towards the end of our lease, we found out that Amanda\u2019s girlfriend was stealing packages from the building\u2019s main lobby. They did an inspection of our apartment and, since we weren\u2019t prepared, they found that it too messy and also found our weed. We got an email saying that because we were planning on moving once our lease was up, they weren\u2019t going to issue an eviction based on all the wrongdoings above. \n Because we found this out so late, and couldn\u2019t find another place to live in time that was anywhere near our college, we tried reapplying to this complex (it\u2019s across the street from the school). Amazingly, we got accepted. \n This year, we got two additional roommates and moved to a new building. A few days ago we got a call from the leasing office saying that us being allowed back in was a mistake on their part, and that they would be watching us extra closely and would not offer us any second chances this time around if we stepped out of line. So now our concern is that because we are being singled out, they will find any excuse to evict us. \n In any case we are going to let our roommates know about the situation, but we want to have a plan before we talk to them about it. \n Would the right thing be to find people to take our place and move out so as not to put our roommates in danger? Is the danger not as bad as we\u2019re making it out to be? Would they have to issue us a warning first or could they just do what they want at their own discretion? \n Or should we just be careful and hope that we don\u2019t get caught for something minor and risk eviction and all the negative things that come along with it? Is it fair to ask our roommates to take that risk because of us?	Apartment doesn\u2019t want us here, should we leave before they kick us out or just be careful. We need advice.	339	20	needadvice
Not sure if this is the right subreddit to post it, but... \n I'm 22 years old and since I was 14 I don't have good relations with my parents, because they are overprotective and wouldn't let me do anything that they don't have some control of what I'm doing, or never trusted me to be responsible for something (for example - they wouldn't let me walk on the street even when I was 16, my mom always picked me up whenever I was... I said a lot of times it would be easier if I used a bike or I could go walking but my mom thought it was too dangerous, needless to say that going out with friends they didn't like or going out in a place they didn't knew it was impossible). But they pay the bills, so even with argues and fights I sticked along with them and obey what they told me. \n However when I was 17/18 I thought I would be able to make some decisions on my own, which university study, where to live. But in the country I live, if the parents can afford is common to help financially their kids even after they graduatte in college. So they still wanted to control me and I couldn't handle this anymore and said if this was going to continue I would leave, and try to be independent on my own. For the very first time they would listen what I would say. \n Almost four years later....I'm still not sure if was a good decision to negociate with them because I try to keep away from them and just now they started to say that I don't talk to them anymore, they don't know any of my friends, and it's impossible to continue this way. \n The problem is keeping they close to me just bring me problem (in 2008 , I only said I wanted to live on my own after being diagosed with depression. And last year they ruined my relationship with my exgf because they said she was getting in my way) and the university I choosed to study is full time, so it's impossible for me to work or get and intership until 2014, and even it was possible now, there is no job with my current qualification that would cover my student fees. \n So I don't know if I try to handle two more years with them until I graduate or leave this college and try to start a cheaper one with my own resources	Have overprotective parents who ruins my life but cover my student fees in a top school	424	16	needadvice
I moved to a new town to be closer to my parents and finish school not too long ago. I have to have a job to keep my head afloat while I'm here. It's a college town, part-time jobs are scarce. When I got here and started applying around, school had just let out and a lot of people had gone home for the summer. I lucked out and got a serving job. The money is wonderful. However, I'm not doing too great in my manager's eyes. I do little things wrong a LOT. I've been here about 3 weeks, I understand that I'm still new..but this other girl started the same time as me and is doing great. Customers rave about her and even go online to the company's website to compliment her. I'm not hating on her, she's cool. It just makes me look even worse. I worked this morning, had a party of six, and didn't do too well. I was awkward. Turns out, I was waiting on one of my boss's fiance. I don't think he was too impressed with me. Because of being with her, he knows everything we;re supposed to do. I heard him talking about things I forgot. Obvious things. Oh yeah, one of the people with them is a fellow server. It was awful. We're also supposed to hand out these surveys with the customer's ticket when they're done with their meal. It gives them an option to go online and answer questions about their visit. Every server is supposed to have like ~5 a month. I've had zero. I'm terrified of getting fired all the time. I know it's not in my head, my managers don't like me. I know I'm walking a fine line. It's at a time of the year where getting a job here is impossible. People come in multiple times a day asking for applications. If I get fired, I'm so fucked. I've had a bad, bad feeling all day. I really think my time is limited and I'm freaking out. I can't say anything to my parents. I just put a deposit down on an apartment and am going to have a roommate. Her parents are going to pay her part of the rent, mine depends on my job. I'm worried if I don't walk in tomorrow with having a survey filled out by a customer, my time is done. I'd do one myself, but I have no idea if they track the IP address or anything. If they found out I did one for myself, I'd without a doubt be let go. I'm freaking out. :(	I'm worried about being fired from this job I really need, I'm trying to improve but I think it's too late.	441	21	needadvice
This October I began my 2nd year in Computer Science, at the same time I got a part-time job as an Intel Rep which I have been really enjoying. \n I let work get the better of me and have spent far to much time not studying, 4 days a week at work currently. I told my employer/family that I was handling both with ease. I have missed a great many lectures and fallen behind on a horrendous amount of coursework and study to the point I do not have a clue what they are talking about when I do turn up for lectures. \n I know that if I quit the job now, I will catch up with my Uni work to an extent that I will be on track for a 2:2, possibly a 2:1 if I work non-stop through christmas etc. But this would mean no more family time, no time to see friends and likely destroying my social life for quite a long period. I have ruined my chances of achieve a 1st unless I were to retake this year. \n I am now very tempted by the idea to just freeze my Uni year, continue working part time, hit the gym and get my life together and pick up where I left off next year. The main things putting me off this are the fact that life is to short to just discard a whole year and tuition fees rise from 3k to 9k next year. That would mean approximately another 18k in tuition fees. \n I could just drop Uni altogether and continue working, but I feel I am currently only suited to mainstream people/public facing employment, I prefer to be behind the scenes. I feel a Computer Science degree would help me to get the skills to achieve this. \n I have not spoken with my Tutors/Parents about this, as I have lied to them and told them that I am handling everything fine. Parents would be hugely disappointed, not to mention grandparents whom occasionally sent food aid packages and helped put money towards study books. \n This situation is entirely my fault and I should have left the job sooner, but I do need the money if I want to keep the luxuries I have grown so used to, such as a  car and being able to occasionally go out with friends. If I told my parents I needed to leave the job, they would happily supply me \xa310-\xa320 a week to keep me fed and in clean clothes! \n Any tips or advice from people that have maybe been in similar situations? For now, I am getting back to hitting the study as much as possible and have requested a week off work to get back on top of things. Thanks Reddit, feeling under at the moment so just needed to let this out. =)	Failing start of 2nd year in CS degree, freeze and continue next year or try to catch up?	477	18	needadvice
Yes, yes. You need not tell me that this is a poor, pathetic and somewhat low thing to ask, but it's really playing on me. \n Ok, the item in Question was a Playstation 3. But not just any PS3, it was my PS3. I don't usually associate any feelings with inanimate objects, let alone a games console of all things, but I sold this back in 2010 to a local buyer (he picked it up). Late last year, I suddenly felt a whole load of sweet, sweet nostalgia with that console - all the times I've played with my friends religiously after secondary school - and it really, really made me want my console back. \n Like a normal person, I first bought the most recent model. But, this was just a PS3 - not the machine that has given my teenage-self so much fun. So I looked at my eBay account (I know, this is really dodgy) and found the seller who bought it for \xa3120. Looking at their feedback, they haven't yet sold it on eBay (I mean, they could have given it away or broken it for all I know - but at least they haven't sold it on the platform in which they bought it from). \n Now, admittedly, I've already sent them a message - a brief message late last year saying that if they ever would want to sell it, I'd most certainly be interested in buying it. No. Response. #worry \n So here's me query, albeit probably the saddest, most pathetic /r/help request out there.... ----> \n ---->	How could I construct an email in such a way I could persuade this person I once sold an item to, to sell the item back to me? \n Thank you.	261	30	needadvice

"I'm 26 and my older 28 yr brother rages over nothing.  Last night I didn't want to move this exercise equipment that he was stubbing his toe on.  Which I understand in of itself but I said I didn't want to move it because there's no other place for it.  The argument escalates and he throw it against the wall and shakes me and threatens me physically.  I'm not afraid of him physically though he's 6'1"" and I'm 5'11"" but I'm 40 lbs heavier and I work out. \n He's been like this since High School, blames all his problems on everyone else, punched holes in doors and spit on the walls.  My parents don't know what to do with him.  He doesn't have a job and complains his way to getting my parents to support him to build his start up website.  The site is well-done in my opinion and I think the skills he's learned by doing it could land him some kind of job.  But I don't think it's going to make a living wage anytime soon.  After a year of asking from my parents he applied to one part-time job but didn't get it.  He's hasn't had a professional-level job before.  His last official job was busing tables in Hawaii (yes, he demanded he live in Hawaii).  This didn't cover all his bills though. \n What makes me mad is the shit my parents have to go through, as well as how he acts towards me.  We give him everything and he acts like a spoiled brat. \n He complains non-stop about his sinus issue, which I think is a problem but he goes way over board.  He had a deviated septum which I wonder how much was attributed to all the fights and cocaine use.  Like he said our other half-brother, who I know for sure has a debilitating auto-immune disease, doesn't feel anything close to the pain he does.  This is crazy in my opinion.  Our brother is on disability and has worked for years with doctors, gone to Mayo etc.  He has Vitiligo but honestly I've never noticed it.

WTF I don't even notice it. \n My friend who's about to intern has a psychiatrist mom and they said he's depressed and should see a psychiatrist.

Ok, so my best friend (Fiona) got into an argument a few months ago with a mutual friend (Emily). When it first happened Emily came to me for advice, and I told her to let things cool down a bit, and then talk to Fiona. I also told her (Emily) I wouldn't stop being friends with her just because Emily was mad at her. \n The thing is, Emily has apologized for the things she said to Fiona and has tried to reach out to her to patch things up, but  refuses to even respond to a text, let alone see Fiona in person. Fiona ended up de-friending Emily on FB since she wouldn't respond, and Emily got ALL upset over that. (Fuck fb....) \n Anyway, Emily also happens to be dating a guy friend of mine (and Fiona's) who might as well be family. Emily can't avoid Fiona forever, especially since I'm getting married in a few weeks and they'll all be there. (Emily's BF is in the wedding party, as is Fiona) I have tried to talk to Emily about it (as have other people) and she  refuses  to say anything about it. When I brought it up she literally shut her mouth and just kept shaking her head until I changed to subject. This makes me think she knows that she's in the wrong here. \n It sounds like such a childish problem, I know, but it's getting really awkward for me! I'm really trying to stay out of it, but I don't want to have to choose between my bestie and my (very close) friend's girlfriend. We're all in our 20s and I honestly thought Emily was more mature than this. \n I don't know exactly what kind of advice I'm looking for; I just need something please!

4 years ago I started my dream job. It's what I wanted to do when I was in school, it's what I went to University to learn and I moved to a new city to start it. But while I enjoy the work, I've become increasingly unhappy. \n The company I work for is one of the best at what they do. I work alongside some hugely talented people and get to work on some amazing projects. The kind of stuff I could only have dreamt about doing 5 years ago. As far as first time jobs go, it couldn't be better. I've learned so much just being around these people that I couldn't have asked for more. \n The problem is I just have no social life, with the majority of my weekends spent by myself. The company is small, about 20 people. I get along with my co-workers, but I'm one of the few people who are single and live alone, while everyone else have partners, kids/babies and aren't looking to socialise outside of work. I am kind of introvert which doesn't help of course. but while things have gotten better, over the past couple of year I've began to feel pretty unhappy most of the time, and the lowest points pretty bad depression. \n &nbsp; \n Recently my brother told me about some jobs going at his work and if I applied the job would pretty much be mine. I get along with him really well so working along side him would be a dream. What's more is I already know his co-workers and can pretty much guarantee my social life would be a whole lot better there. \n I was already considering changing jobs. While my current position is great for a first timer, being such a small company there is little room for me to progress. I'm pretty much on the bottom rung of the ladder with no where else to go. \n But while the work is very similar to what I do, career wise its a different path. It's going to be less pay and I'm going to leave behind a job that I can't help but feel most would give their left leg for. I'd have to move city and go through a ton of upheaval. \n &nbsp; \n So I just can't decide what to do. Should I sacrifice a great job for the chance of a happier life somewhere else, even if the job isn't a perfect fit? Nothing is forever, and if worse comes to worse I could always looks for work else where. At least I'll be happier in the meantime. Or should I stick with it a and hope something better comes along? \n If anyone's got any advice/thoughts/words of wisdom please share. I think my main worry is that my head is telling me I'm just throwing in the the towel and taking the easy road out, rather than dealing with the problem. That If I just man up I could somehow overcome it. But my heart is telling me I should do what makes me happy and what I'm doing right now isn't it. \n &nbsp;	I've got a great job, but I'm no longer happy because 4 years down the line my social life is pretty much non-existent. Should I gamble it on an imperfect job, but with the prospect of having a happier life. Even if its only in the mean time.	521	48	needadvice
Two weeks ago my girlfriend secretly left her entire life behind to escape her psycho gangster ex boyfriend. Prior to this he had threatened her life on more than one occasion and had installed tracking/monitoring devices on her phone and laptop, showed up at her house in the middle of the night to stand outside her window watching her, poisoned a friend of hers who he thought she might be interested in dating, and randomly showed up at places she happened to be. \n This guy is rich and powerful in Jamaica. As a result she couldn't go to the corrupt police and even if she could he has the resources to easily make her disappear anytime he felt like it. \n She is now in the U.S. and we are furiously trying to figure out the cheapest and quickest way to start getting her life reestablished here as a citizen, or anything that legally allows her to reside and work here. We have been looking at student visas but they are incredibly expensive with no guarantee and we've been talking to some of her friends about setting her up with a work permit. She only has a couple months to get things sorted out. We'll also be talking to a lawyer in the next couple weeks to explore our options. \n I know this sounds incredibly far fetched. I've told her many times that her life sounds like a bad Hollywood movie. But we could really use some advice at this point. \n Thanks for reading. Wasn't sure where to post this :/	Jamaican gangster ruined my girlfriends life now we are trying to pick up the pieces and start over.	260	18	needadvice
"Hey guys, this is my first Reddit post, so sorry if it's formatted poorly or whatever. Anyways, I had a really traumatizing ""oh god why"" incident last year in seventh grade, and I honestly have no idea whether I should do something about it or just let it go. So here's the story: \n In 7th grade, I was that quiet little Asian nerd who had no friends. One day, I got a little pissed at a poser in science class and told him he was going over the top with trying to act cool. Usually, popular kids like him don't really give a crap because, after all, I'm just another nobody at my school. But this guy decides to try to be a badass and ends up putting a few cuts in my hand using some staples. The cuts weren't that deep, so I didn't need any stitches or anything, but they were still pretty huge. Being a stupid teenager, I didn't show the teacher, because I wanted to at least try to get some respect for not being a snitch. So I just kept my hand in my pocket all day. However, the guy who cut my hand was proud of what he did and thought he was the sh*t. \n Luckily, that day was the Friday before a break, so the wound was healed by the time I returned to school. Oh and I forgot: I go to a public school in a rich white neighborhood, so shit like this would have a ton of consequences, including a counter-productive ""conflict management"" session. Back to the story. I showed a few of my friends who don't go to my school, and they told me to kick they guy's ass, but that would just have me end up in deeper shit. So I ended up doing nothing :("	In 7th grade, a guy in my class put some cuts in my hand using staples, but nobody saw and I was too scared to do anything about it. It's been a year since then, and I have no idea whether I should do something about it or just let it go. \n Thanks in advance for your advice :)	307	59	needadvice
"I've been part of several different ""groups"" of friends. Mostly from moving a lot. It was always really easy for me to make friends since I was still in school when I made most of these friends. Now that I'm getting older and I feel like I'm maturing, I notice that a lot of my friends aren't. And they're holding it against me. \n It's hard to explain. I basically don't like my friends because they act like complete idiots and drink themselves into oblivion. They're beginning to not like me because I want to stay home and get rest when I have to work the next day or on a Friday night I would like to watch a movie or Doctor Who because I'd rather not spend the money to go out and party. Or if I want to do something outside of the house I'd rather go to the movies or do literally any other activity instead of going to the bars. \n I live in a college town but I'm just a townie. I don't know how to meet new friends that I would like being around. I've lost touch with the other friends that I now realize ""grew up"" before me.. I don't hold it against them but I feel like we've become too distant. \n I've been living with roommates since I moved out of my dad's years ago. In January I'll be moving by myself for the first time ever. I'm a generally happy person but I'm afraid of what might happen if I become overly lonely... \n Edit:"	I want to make new friends and I have no idea how to without being weird.	261	16	needadvice
So I met her about a year ago, but nothing really happened, I just knew her from that one time. Until I recently hung out with her. (She's a friend of a couple of guys I know). \n We're at this festival. At the start of the night my three other friends are acting really silly (being childish really) and I started talking to her. We all drank a lot and did a few caf\xe9s (Europe).  She's really into me and we keep on conversation. She's always sat down next to me to talk to me and even asked if I had a girlfriend. We discussed some feelings we had for people in the past. \n Then  all five of us go play videogames (we were 'really' drunk then) at her appartment. It's a small appartment so her bed is next to her tv. I lay down as the others play videogames. She lies down next to me. We laugh a little and have fun, she becomes very touchy. Nothing happened cause all my friends were there (and still acting childish). \n We all went home. \n Now what should I do. I tried IM'ing her on facebook chat but the conversation ended quickly. (I only said I liked the band she recommended) Did she act this way cause she was drunk (and needed affection) or should I keep on starting conversation? (try msn or something? I don't have her cellphone number). \n She didn't start conversation with me since then. \n Any advice on how to start talking to her or know if she's interested? (NO asking on dates, that's too creepy for European standards)	I had a lot of fun with this girl, can't get myself to talking to her. I want to know if she's interested.	270	23	needadvice
Hey guys, here's my situation. I'm very nervous about where my future is going and I need advice on how to make the best of the time I have now and how to properly execute my plans. Throwaway account -- been a Redditor for a long time. \n First off I have to be out of where I'm living now with family members Oct. 1 -- my girlfriend and I are planning on moving in together at some place we can split 50/50 -- I'm nervous about this because when I was younger (20 now 18 then) some of my roommates kinda fucked me and since we all signed the lease I have an eviction on my tenant record. So it's not as easy as finding a place and moving right on in. \n Money shouldn't be too much of a problem -- I've recently been getting more hours at my job and even had a second job extended to me (yet to take it) as for my lady she works damn near full time and brings home good money. We have about a grand saved up and we still have a little less than two months \n Next issues is I currently have a fucked up car in the driveway -- not sure how much it is going to cost and the only other option I have is to buy another car that's in good working order for $500 dollars here in the next few weeks \n Also, we're both starting school here in the next 2 weeks. \n I guess I'm just nervous/stressed because I have so much to do but I'm hoping to get some advice from the Reddit community and I'll answer any further questions you may need	Moving out, saving money, buying a car, starting school -- need advice and insight.

"Ok so here's the deal: \n For my last year of University, me and 3 acquaintances moved into a house together privately rented out by the landlord (let's call him Steve) for 12 months from the first of July 2009. \n There never had been much contact between the tenants and the landlord, considering things ran pretty smoothly. Bills were all paid and monthly rent on time. No problem. \n Fast forward to leaving the house, I was notified by the landlord that I was to move out of the house by the 31st of June because the house was being sold on to a new owner at the beginning of July. These new owners had visited several times before hand and checked out the house and the rooms, and had planned on completely redoing the kitchen and living room (which tbh were in poor condition when we moved in, but we didnt complain because it was cheap rent). \n I lived in the largest room on the top floor along with one other housemate and a bathroom, when we two left, the entire top floor was completely cleared and in very good condition. The kitchen and living still contained a lot of stuff that was there when we moved in and was still in a poor condition. \n It has been more than a month, and I still have yet to get my \xa3200 pound deposit back. He has not returned my calls, but apparently he told one of my other housemates that he was keeping half of the total deposits (that is \xa3400 pounds) for ""cleaning duties"", on which he apparently spent 2 days. \n What I don't understand is how he can justify keeping the deposits for so long or taking so much from us poor students, considering the house was being given to new owners who had already agreed to buy the place in the first place. If the kitchen and living room was going to be demolished and replaced, why bother cleaning it. They pretty much dumped everything that wasn't nailed down. \n A few other notes: \n \n one of our housemates (who was the one Steve told about the deposits) is a complete bitch who left a shitload of stuff in her room and then complained that the rest of us were all incompetent at cleaning. \n \n There is still an outstanding electricity bill which I've been trying to get sorted but is quite hard to do considering Steve won't return my calls and I don't actually live there anymore. \n \n I still have the contract here if anybody has any questions about it"	Landlord won't return calls or deposit after leaving university: help needed as to course of action.	430	16	needadvice
Recently, a friend came home from a tour of service overseas. In high school (we're now all about 21..or, I will be in two weeks time), myself, my friend who just returned (we'll call him Steve), and another friend (we'll call him Dave) were all best friends. We went to a pretty crummy high school, we didn't really study hard, we spent most of our time getting day-drunk and playing Rock Band and Halo 3. \n After graduation, we all kind of set out on different paths. Steve went to Italy and Afghanistan for his service. I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted to do after high school, but got into community college. After a semester I realized I definitely needed to get a bachelor's degree if I planned on getting anywhere I wanted to go. Dave is a different story. Dave didn't really do much. He still works as a waiter, and does nothing but smoke weed and drink all day. \n After graduation, Dave (who at the time was already 20, a late enroller into classes) kind of started going after my sister (who was just going on 16 at the time). They ended up dating, which I found incredibly weird on so many different levels that I stopped communicating with both of them. I moved out of my house for about a year because my family self-imploded (which was about 15 years overdue). My parents got divorced, and my sister who's now only turning 18 moved in with Dave. \n I feel sometimes like I'm the only one who thinks the whole situation is udderly fucking ridiculous. At the family functions, the talk is never about my cousin who's making it in California as a hotel manager, or my cousin who recently graduated with a degree in marketing, or me going to a fairly solid university. It's always about my sister, who works in fast food, struggles to make rent and has no plans for the future. Not to mention, she dresses like a slob, and doesn't take care of herself and lets Dave mooch off of her. I've completely stopped talking to her, and it took a few theraphy sessions to cope with the fact my parents did a really shitty job of parenting because they were in a really shitty marriage and did a really shitty job of taking care of themselves physically and emotionally. But that all is what it is, and I've moved on. I realize that getting hung up on those things isn't going to get me to where I want to me - making new friends, working out and studying hard is what's going to get me there. \n Now zip forward to present day. I get a call from Steven who's with a bunch of our high school friends, including Dave. I say that I don't want to come if Dave's there. For me, the whole thing is awkward, I haven't talked to him since high school, and I'd be content moving accross the country and never talking to Dave or my sister again. Steve gives me a bunch of flack, and my own friend Alyssa is complaining that she wanted me to meet her friend, so forth and so on. \n *	Dave has done nothing since high school, and is in a relationship with my sister. I think they're both bums and want nothing to do with them, but my friend is trying to get us to hang out. Am I being ridiculous, or do I have a valid reason to avoid Dave?	538	52	needadvice
For the past months I have been taking care of a 12yr old girl who's constantly depressed (I'm 20yrs old). Before I took the role of being her brother she often ran away from home and cut herself. She's also deeply involved with the social services and is forced to go to a psychologist and her parents are instructed to keep 24/7 surveillance on her. This includes her not being allowed to sleep alone and she may not lock the door when she's in the bathroom. \n I thought at first glance that this tactic was good but after some thinking I realized that this is one of the major reasons that she's so depressed. She feels like she's in jail. Never a chance to be alone, when every conversation she has with her parents feels like an interrogation. The fact that her parents have been fighting with one another since she was born doesn't really help either... \n Then there's her eating disorders. She hates meat more than anything (seriously how is it possible to live without bacon), and that has gone as far as her turning in to a vegan. I don't really see any problem in that though but that's not all, she also refuses to eat almost anything that isn't either liquid based or crispy. This is because she thinks everything has the consistency of meat... even vegetables.. I have no idea how to make her eat again. Atm it's working because we were able to find enough material for her to stay healthy, but since she cannot eat noodles for the rest of her life something has to be done. I can't really tell her to just start eating either since I'm trying to give her a life of her own, a free will. Since that is what she longs for. \n I've been making some progress though. I made her parents understand what seems to be the problem and what needs to be done on her part. I've also gotten complete trust from not just her but her parents and siblings as well. She's also started to see a meaning in life. I've spent my entire vacation showing her what's beautiful here on earth. A plan has also been made, first step is to get her away from the social services and that crappy psychologist of hers. Then she's going to get a chance to try out Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Her parents agree to this plan and have promised to help out. Then I've stopped her from running away from home and cutting herself. \n Then there's the downsides. Me and my gf almost broke up because I laid almost all of my health, mana and APM on this little girl (Although this is solved now, I think...). Now she also has problems sleeping when I'm not by her side. She can stay up to 5AM some nights, just thinking about how much her life sucks. I can't let her sleep at my place every night since I've started working again and have a gf. I doubt her parents would appreciate as well. \n The reason I posted here is because I'm starting to lose focus on what I need to do. I'd also appreciate any solutions on what can be done with her eating disorder. \n I'm sorry for this sloppy wall of text, haven't really looked through it and corrected all the grammatical errors. \n Ooh btw, we're not biological siblings, if that's not already obvious. c:	I'm trying to help a 12yr old girl get her feet back on track.

"I guess it's a typical story, I just never thought I'd be one of them: I'm a composer and pianist whose put thousands and thousands of hours into my craft, which I'm already very naturally talented at, about to graduate college with the Senior Academic Achievement award and a great GPA, but I just realized after my study abroad trip/finding-yourself experience that I  don't want to be a professional musician , even though I'm sure it'd be possible for me as a commercial pianist and arranger. I have realized that my serious tendencies to avoid all things music (practicing, writing, listening) are because I love it so much.

I was called at work and told my wife could not be woken up on couch.  I came home immediately.  I couldn't wake her up, but she was breathing. \n I called her mother and we decided to load her into the car and take her to the ER.  On the way she stopped breathing and her mother flagged down a cop on the street.  He got the EMTs and they intubated her on the spot. \n She ended up on a respirator for the night.  The next day she was okay and they were planning to discharge her.  Unfortunately the hospital staff had not accurately documented her meds (despite me and her mom telling them the history and current meds at least 4 times), and her respiritory system shut down a 2nd time.  (This was partly my wife's fault for accepting meds she knew she was NOT on.) \n Finally, that evening they discharged her to her mother's house and it ALL happened again.  She nearly died, her mom did CPR and the re-admitted her to the ICU.  They found pnuemonia in her right lung and said it was from the initial intubation. \n Part of the problem is my wife's history as a drug addict.  We've seen similar scene's with her, but not nearly this bad. \n My questions are these: What can I do to improve the hospitals intake/communication problem so this doesn't happen again... \n and:  I have an opportunity to force my wife to do in-patient treatment.

"So basically, my best friend of 9 years and I are living together and we both started drinking at a young age, I had an accident because of alcohol and quit drinking completely almost three years ago. My roommate has been known to get incredibly shitfaced and start fights, get himself injured etc. Over the past few years it's been progressively worse, and less than a month ago I was awakened at 5 in the morning by a mutual friend/ one of his drinking buddies because he'd started several fights with some people and now he was in the hospital for some stitches. I got to the hospital and roommate told me that he can't remember what happened, but he has been cut up with a knife or bottle or something. I of course knew him and his drinking buddy well enough to piece together that they were being shitheads and someone retaliated.

This could be a long one. We'll start of with me [F18] and boyfriend (L) [M19] together 3 years and attend the same university. This summer I'm going on vacation with L, his step-brother (J), his step-brothers girlfriend (C) and his step-father (who is recently divorced from boyfriend's mother, but they're still on good terms). L's parents are funding his trip, and we're staying in a hotel. Because of the views of the adults involved (very closed minded and ignorant), I expected C and I to be rooming together. Boys in one room, girls in another. A couple days ago, however, I found out that J and C are splitting a room, leaving L and I to split a room (which makes more financial sense). This obviously isn't new or terribly exciting to us, as we stay together for days at a time at school, but L's parents refuse to believe that we're adults and seem to think that we're still 14 and will take every opportunity to attempt procreation. We haven't openly asked their opinion yet, but it's pretty evident from past experiences that L's parents won't pay for his trip if he and I sleep in the same room. L wants to just lie about it and say I'm staying with C, but I'm hesitant because of how close his mom and step-dad still are. So my question to you- do I try to approach his parents (because he refuses) and explain to them that we ARE adults, we've proved ourselves as such, and try to shake them of their naivety, or do I risk it and try to lie to them? As petty as this sounds, it really is a pretty big deal in this scenario.

The majority of the people I ""know"" now live on the other end of the skype call, most of which I have never seen in person. \n As for my job I was working as a security guard for a private company for 7 months until I was offered a job that paid almost twice what I was making with 32 hours a week. I got told on my 6th day that the contract with the client had been cancelled and I haven't had any hours since then. I only got into the field in the first  place because it was the easiest solution to me at the time for a job. I hate it. It has no advantage for me towards a career. The problem with that is I'm not even sure what I want to do, I have a few options in mind but I'm never sure about any of them. To make things a tad more sad I thought about it and took some random ""What Career Is Right For Me?"" test online, both the 2nd and 3rd times I lied in hopes I'd find something more appealing, but ironically got the same answer each time in the results. Counseling Psychologist. I have always been fascinated with how people work. The human mind, and the way it makes us act the way we do, or feel about things the way we do. But when I see myself in that career choice I see two problems, A) What do I do in the meantime for work until I can achieve that goal, and B) I can't help but literally feel that I will be alone for the rest of my life. No idea why the 2nd feeling is there but it is. But about the first option, is there something I can maybe do that can be entry level that can be seen as a ""stepping stone"" into the field of Psychology? \n Anyways, that's all I got for now. Questions and comments are always welcome. Sorry for the length"	I'm feeling like I'm watching my life and opportunities pass me by and I'm stuck without any hint at where I go from here.	617	24	needadvice
"I grew up horribly isolated and extremely shy (I'm talking panic attacks when the teacher called on me in class - so maybe not ""shy"" so much as ""severe social anxiety""?), and I was bullied throughout elementary school and junior high. Even when the bullying pretty much stopped in high school, by then I had built up this protective persona (superior, bitchy, emotionless, manipulative, dishonest, etc) so much that almost no one was interested in being my friend. I worked extremely hard to overcome my shyness through a combination of improv club and my aforementioned superior ice queen persona, and I was lucky enough to succeed, mostly. \n I'm in my early/mid 20s now, and nowadays I'm not quite as unfriendly as I used to be. I work in customer service and I'm ok at my job, I'm genuinely pleasant with my coworkers, I make small talk with (receptive) strangers out in public, and sincerely/non-creepily compliment people often. But still, I am horribly, desperately lonely, and I realize that I'm not exactly a catch as far as friends go. I've tried to do the standard ""friend-making"" things (joining groups for things I'm interested in, meeting people just for the sake of meeting people instead of with a ""friend making agenda,"" etc) and I just don't seem to be getting anywhere. Some of this is due to the fact that I don't really have a whole lot of interests and I probably smell like desperation, but I'm scared that I'm a sociopath and completely incapable of being friends with people. I know that I can be super manipulative (and if I'm being honest, I kind of delight in it sometimes, even though I'm aware that it's horrible) and although I've always felt that I'm smarter than most people, I've become more aware that I'm really not and people are probably able to pick up on it when I think they're inferior. \n Despite my social issues, I've somehow never had difficulty getting involved in romantic relationships. I have, unfortunately, been in a couple of relationships with an abusive partner (and I'm currently in one - working on getting out, don't worry), but generally I've dated perfectly lovely men and women. I have never pursued anyone romantically/sexually, but I seem to passively enter these relationships very easily and then they get super intense quickly. I've never been single for more than a couple of weeks at a time. I realize that this is not healthy, but I can't seem to stop. \n I know that you're going to recommend therapy! I would too, if I was hearing this from someone else. Therapy is theoretically awesome, and it's something that I know I need. The only thing holding me back is an experience I had as a teen. My mother put me in therapy and unbeknownst to me, the therapist reported back to her nearly everything I said. It was a huge breach of trust and it traumatized me. I know that this sort of thing is very unusual and totally illegal, so I'm pretty confident that it would never happen again, but still. Traumatic! So I'm very very cautious about finding a therapist, and I'm scared that I'll pick the wrong one and it will ruin therapy for me forever, again. \n I would really appreciate input here, even if it's just, ""yes, you suck, get thee to therapy!"""	I think I'm a shitty person and I want to stop being shitty, and I'm horribly lonely and would like to maybe not be that way anymore too.	563	28	needadvice
Let me just first say that this is not a solicitation for cash or favors - my family is trying to remain budget-conscious, but we do have money to do this the expensive way if that turns out to be the only real option. \n So, a little background - I separated from the US Navy about a month ago after five years.  When that happens, they will pay to move you back home (or a shorter distance).  For my family, that meant a move from Bremerton, WA to Philadelphia, PA.  One quit k is that they will NOT move vehicles.  Ok, whatever - road trip!  We figured we could see a few sights like the Grand Canyon along the way and still be home in time for me to attend a hiring conference on Aug 30 and start classes Sep 1. Since we don't have a house yet, they'll be putting our stuff in storage for a month or two while we close in a place, and we needed to have everything we'd need for that block of time with us in the car. It's more than what we just needed for the trip is the point. \n So me, my wife, and our infant son set out. Things were going fine until we we're hit by a stranger in an accident today in rural Arizona.  Everyone is ok, but the car is totaled. So now I need a way to get everything home in time for the aforementioned events. As far as I can see, I have two main options: \n 1 - Rent a car and continue driving.  Insurance will pay for the car, but there may he an additional fee due to the extreme distance. We were already behind schedule when the accident occurred, and now we're losing more time staying in town to rest up after the stressful day and wait for the insurance adjust or to confirm the car is indeed totaled.  Plus my seven month old son means that just slamming Monsters and driving for 40 hours straight isn't really viable. \n 2 - Fly home. The main reason we drove, you'll recall, is to get the car itself home. Now we don't have a car, and well eventually just get mailed a check when this is all sorted. That's fine, but we have way more stuff than I can take on a plane. Call it 2-3 times as much for round numbers. I can either pay for extra luggage in the plane or try to ship it UPS or something, but none of those options looks cheap. \n So I'm looking for creative solutions, or at least some advice on which option would probably be the cheapest. Obviously I'm going to be looking into all that myself, but some ideas on where to start (eg what airline) would be immense helpful. Whew. Thanks for reading all that. \n Edit: pic of my car:	Need to move a bunch of stuff from Arizona to Philly cheaply and quickly.	485	14	needadvice
"Hello Reddit, \n I have dealt with ED-NOS in the past (basically I behaved like an anorexic but my period never stopped, so I was not actually anorexic), but I have my behaviors largely under control and mostly healthy at the moment. I still deal with the negative thoughts that go along with it, but my weight is within a normal range and on most days I eat comparably to any other broke and somewhat lazy young adult--  not the best or most consistent eating habits, but most days I consume ""normal"" calories. \n My current roommate dealt with a very serious case of purging-type anorexia (and some bulimic tendencies) up until about one year ago. She has gone from purging upwards of four times a day and being quite depressed overall to only purging once every few months and having a much more positive and healthy demeanor. We were great friends back when we were both struggling, but it's only now because we are both doing better that I felt comfortable deciding to live with her. I felt that we would not have made good roomies in the past because I constantly worried about her. \n Well, her BF of almost 2 years just broke up with her, and she is responding as poorly as I had feared would happen. A couple days ago, she casually mentioned that she skipped lunch and ""starved"" all day, and I tried to brush it off and said ""now why would you do a silly thing like that?"" Then she started eating my leftover cookies from a party at work, and kept eating them... so I casually cleaned the kitchen and put them away in the pantry. Soon thereafter, after I went to bed she took a shower and I could clearly hear that she was purging. :( \n The next day I texted her (she was at work) to let her know that I could hear her, because I thought she should probably know (she was obviously trying to cover up the sound but it didn't work) and she apologized. She said she will try to be more discreet... Problem is, I know her so well, I can tell exactly what she is doing when she behaves like this, and I don't think it's going to be ""discreet"" enough. As for me, I am already having thoughts of starving myself again, and for my breakfast and lunch today at work I brought a few pieces of deli meat, and was planning on skipping dinner. Then I reconsidered. Then I re-re-considered. I don't know. I already feel very self-conscious of my current size, and I have that antsy feeling that makes me want to do something irrational about it, and I don't like it. \n I don't want to make her feel even more horrible and guilty, but at the same time I want her to know that her actions are affecting me as well... and obviously I want to support her too, because I love her. I don't want to condemn her, and I know a few slip-ups are to be expected... but if this becomes a pattern I am afraid it will rub off on me as well. :/"	My roommate is returning to old eating disorder habits, and it's triggering me to do the same. \n Advice?	533	18	needadvice

For the past couple of weeks it has been unbearable living with my mother. She has always been a messy person, but has been able to hide it behind rooms that would literally be neck deep in trash/junk of her stuff. I have lived in a pig sty for most of my life. \n However, in the last few weeks/months its been so unbearable. No longer is the mess hidden, but its literally everywhere. The lounge room, the kitchen, the bathroom, the laundry. I trip on things and graze myself constantly. I'm near breaking point (let me rephrase that, I have passed breaking point, multiple times). I'm not a very good daughter in general - she's always let me treat her as i pleased, which is another psychological issue that I have in that I believe I'm not even worth a piece of trash because of the guilt of how i talk to her, scream or swear. \n I don't know what to do anymore. Help would cost $1000 for 2 weeks because she refuses to ask anyone she knows for help. I literally wake up in the morning in a clean room where everything I own is organised perfectly (I have moderate levels of OCD) and then I step outside my room and I feel like ripping my hair out. \n I jsut... I can't handle it anymore, I feel like overeating all the time due to the stress and the anxiety I have. I walk in the house after being out for the day to a severe depression that just instantly rises over my head. I'm snappy, moody and bitter all the time. My mum just sits at home on her computer becuase shes going through a bit of a mid life crisis. I don't blame her, shes had to work hard her whole life. Monday-Friday 9-3 job. But I just...can't handle this. \n What can I do/ :'(	Live in mess, literally. The whole house is a pig sty, my mind can't function anymore.

Some background: I'm F, 20. \n This past fall (I'm in college) I moved to a different town to be closer to my school, about 50 miles away from home. Not too far but I'm still able to get away and this town is much larger and has a lot more opportunities than my home town. I had been commuting home on weekends to work at my job back home so I could pay my rent. About a month into commuting, I found a new job and quit the old one, but still on good terms with my bosses. \n After I had been working at the new job for about two months, I was informed that the place would be closing down for about two months to relocate because of a disagreement with their current landlord. It closed pretty close to the start of winter break, so I moved back home for my month-long break to work at my old job, where my bosses were happy to have me back and give me hours. So now I have been living at home for about three weeks. \n Here's the thing, though:\nMy boss (at job #1, back home) came to me with a job offer. She asked me to keep working there, and I would get a raise. Then for the summer I would nanny her kids because her current nanny will be on maternity leave. Now, I love these kids and I always enjoy when I get to babysit them. I will get paid about what I would be getting paid. \n Pros of job #1:\nAbout $1 more an hour than job #2\nMore hours\nRent there is cheaper \nCloser to family and BF\nAn opportunity I have been waiting for for years \n Cons of job #1:\nMy hometown sucks\nI don't want to get 'stuck' in this town\nHave to commute to school (two days a week)\nI have worked there for 5 years and after awhile with no break I start to go crazy- which is basically why I am hesitant to go back \n Pros of job #2:\nCloser to school\nBetter town\nI enjoy my job there \n Cons of job #2:\nNot as close with co-workers\nNot as good pay\nRent is higher\nI will constantly be worried about money\nFarther from family and BF	Move back home to make more money and suck it up for a couple years, or stay away from home in a better town but be broke?	387	27	needadvice
Well, I'm only 16 in the first place. But my hobby is gaming. Has been for a very large portion of my life, and I have recently been getting bored of it. Over the years i've probably invested well over $1000 across systems, including consoles and one big gaming rig which I still use for almost anything BUT games. My Steam library is huge, and I don't play any of the games.. I haven't finished a game all the way through in probably over a year or two. Considering how many games I've bought since then, many would say I have outright wasted money. I tend to agree. \nAnyways, I come to ask.. What do I do now? I've invested SO MUCH into this shit, that I have no idea what to do otherwise. I have friends, and I am somewhat physically fit. Don't assume I'm a chubby lonely kid. I'll say more about myself if necessary. I also Longboard, although I am slowly losing interest in that too. What should I do?

"This is weird, and I'm not sure if I should be asking for advice here: \n Ok, I'm a guy.  And this other guy, was my friend/is my friend.  We work together producing music, and hae been successful together, I have been much more successful without him though.  He is lazy and seems to drain my motivation and energy.  Maybe because he makes me question myself?  He is very judgmental. \n Anywho, for a few weeks when we were hanging out I felt really angry, and was almost bi-polar.   I got in a fight with him, and have ignored him ever since.  Its been 3 months of ignoring him, and I started to feel a lot better.  I was becoming more confident in myself, felt like I was making friends and connecting with people, opening up becoming a man. \n I then went to see him, try to salvage our relationship so we could hae a strictly professional relationship.  Things go good we have a 15 minute talk.  Well I get home, and immediately start feeling this weird anxiety/emotion.

Okay so I bought an 04 Mercury Grand Marquis.  5 year loan, etc etc.  I test drove it, but everything seemed great during the test drive.  Leather bench seats, with plenty of leg room (the leg room is why I bought it).  However, the second day of owning it, I realize that my right leg sorta naturally hangs out too far to the right, and in order to use the pedals normally, I sorta have to actively hold my leg in the correct position, because otherwise my leg hangs out too far to the right.  I've tried every seat position imaginable, and it didn't change anything.  The only thing that seems to help at all is stuffing a shirt under my right leg, so that it sorta holds it in the correct place.  I'm considering buying one of [these]( but not sure if it'll help or not.  Anyone experience something like this before?  How did you resolve it? \n For a few days I was outrageously anxious/depressed because I thought that buying this car was such a huge mistake, since the leg thing is really hard to ignore, and I don't want to feel uncomfortable in my own car for the next ~5 years. \n Help! :(	Bought a car not realizing how uncomfortable it was to drive, now I'm looking for a solution.	205	17	needadvice

In any group of people I find there is always 1 or 2 that decide treat me like I am some kind of villain or enemy.  At my last job it was the accountants, and that has happened before in 2007 at a different job but similar situation.  At another job it was some engineers, at another job it was my coworker, at other jobs it's just been my manager.  But now it's been 12 jobs and it's clear I'm not getting along.  I was in a band and the saxophone player just hated me.  I was in another band and the bass player just hated me.  I was in another band and the guitar player and keyboard player hated me.  I switched to this completely different form of art, in a completely new city, now there are 3 people who are always vibing me, ignoring me, telling other people I suck, etc.  The thing is, although I have tried to be friends with all of these people and at one time thought I was friends with them or on the track to being friends with them, they are all, to a person, bad people.  I know for a fact they are incompetent, lazy, rude, backstabbing, mean.  The list of people who have hated me like this and excluded/worked against me contains to a person consistently the worst people I have ever had to meet.

I\u2019m a Spanish medical student (studying in Spain, just to clear this up). I\u2019ll be a doctor in 3 years (I\u2019m a redditor but made this user only for this post). \n Since I was little, wanted to live in the USA, without knowing exactly why. I even made it for a semester, during which I studied at an American college. I had to come back to Spain to go on with my studies. I loved the experience, and promised myself to try to come back sometime\u2026 to live, or at least, to stay for a few years. Well, my dream involves studying my specialty in the States... \n I have my life here and if everything goes fine (college, exam pre-specialty\u2026), I\u2019ll be working and studying in my country, implying living near my relativities and friends, less stress, less difficult, feeling comfortable, agreeing with our healthcare system\u2026, but something tells me if I don\u2019t try my dream (again), I\u2019ll be wondering and blaming myself all my life. At this point is when I need your opinions/suggestions/advices/criticism/questions/whatever. It's early yet, but if I finally decide to go for it, I must prepare. \n This is how I see it: \n Cons : \n \n My language skills in English are disastrous, as you already noticed. This means I should take classes in these three years. And I could very likely fail anyway. \n The cost of trying my fancy could easily drown me (USMLE, trips, academies in Spain to prepare the exams, paperwork\u2026) to, again, quite possibly fail.  \n I shouldn\u2019t delay my start to work because I'm living off my parents and trying to get my dream includes losing one or two years, remain optimistic.  \n I don\u2019t agree with the American healthcare system (I\u2019m sorry, guys\u2026). \n I was born and raised in a Mediterranean climate and I think if I might live in the North, it could eventually affect me somehow (not a big deal, I guess, but if someone from the South read this, could understand me). \n And, IMHO, the most important one: I think I\u2019m not being realistic at all\u2026 :( \n \n Pros : \n \n There is a chance to realize my dream (yes, one in a million, but still). \n I'm a pretty little rooted and I think I could survive quite happily in the event that got a job in the US. \n Although I\u2019m not in agreement with the US health system, I could adapt (which doesn\u2019t mean sell my principles). \n Physicians\u2019 salaries are much higher in the US than in my country (believe it or not, this isn\u2019t a big reason for me, but yes something to remark as a positive thing). It means give the money back to my parents sooner and all that it entails. Notice I don\u2019t see salary in Spain as a \u201ccon\u201d above. \n \n Every comment is very welcome. Thanks for your time. \n PS1 : I ask my most sincere apologies for my English. I\u2019m not proud to be an English retarded. But please, if someone decides to write, don\u2019t worry and write normally. I mean you don\u2019t need to use simpler language.

Alright Redditors, I need your help. \n After spending the majority of my life interested in applying principles from my various studies to human interactions, I discovered a field that directly studies that interest.

Then I researched it, read everything I could about it, contacted professors at local colleges, and even spoke to the forefather of it himself - Dan Ariely: \n It's been a few months since we spoke, but I want to pursue a Ph D. in Behavioral Economics. I also want to continue my career. So, my questions/comments: \n 1) I believe that creativity and effort most often allow individuals to side step standard 'sacrifices' for what they want. You're welcome to say that it cannot be done or that I clearly don't want it enough if I won't give up my career, but realize that I'm only interested in solutions, not road blocks. I will read your comments but I won't bother arguing and it's unlikely to change my mind. \n 2) I want to perform a study of Behavioral Economics as it applies to my field, process automation. I have a pretty clear picture of the studies I would like to pursue, what I am seeking is advice on how best to present them to Dan to sell him and/or other behavioral economics professors into agreeing to allow me to pursue and publish remotely and/or as a part of my greater job function. \n 3) How to actually knock out prerequisites, work remotely from the institutions I want to be associated with (Dan is at Duke, I live in Houston and my research would be best carried out here)? have any of you heard of Ph. D's being granted to people doing research in industry? I've researched it and found examples, but I have no clear indicators whether it's feasible and/or common in Economics. \n I'll be around until about noon CST if anyone has more detailed questions, I know I left a hell of a lot of detail out. \n Thanks! \n CD	I have a chance to work with some of the smartest people in the world, help me close the deal, plan successfully, and execute on it. I promise I'll share the research with Reddit if I succeed at funding it.	361	40	needadvice
Okay so I've always been rather satisfied with my life and never really complained. But for the past months I have been living on 5 $ a day so I can save 2$ every day. Basically I have about 7$ a day to live on. \n I graduated high school with pretty good grades and tried to find a job. But as time passed by i started to run out of money. I was lucky enough to find some freelance work online as a web developer earning 8$ an hour and nothing I did was good enough. For instance I was ordered to develop a booking system for a hotel. I spent way more hours on that project than I got paid for. Then when I was done I was told by the company that hired me,  A real company doing web development for some pretty big companies around here , that google can't index websites built on top of PHP. A website can only be built using HTML and CSS. And I must not use Div's since google cant index websites using div's so I had to recode it using tables... I quit pretty soon after. \n After that I still couldn't find a job. So i went back to school. And since I cant afford to move or take the buss to school every day I decided to study from home. I study about 10 hours a day so I don't really have time for any freelance work or anything. Only time I have left is during the weekends. I've been single for most of my life but a year or so ago I met my soulmate abroad. There might be a lot in my life I would like to complain about but there is only one thing I do complain about. And its the fact that I can't afford to see the love of my life. \n Her parents have been kind and offered to pay for the visit but it's to much for me to accept so I have been turning them down for a while now. My friends say i'm stupid for not accepting but it's just not in my nature. I guess i'm stupid for not accepting. Anyways they told me that they are going to book me the tickets for christmas and send them to me and they wont take a no for an answer. Problem is even though I have been saving about 2$ every day for the past 4 months I still only have like 50 $ saved up. And thats just what I need to get a new passport so I can go. I really thought I could save up to go. Been eating 1 meal a day usually 1-2 packs of noodles... \n ...120 days living like that and all i have is 50$ which is not even enough to pay for this months school books. I've borrowed money from everyone willing to lend me some and ive sold most of my things just to get by so i'm flat out of ideas here.. \n Okay so thats some quick background info.. now to the question. \n I've been reading reddit for a while now and I've always liked how a bunch of strangers can help each other out so i figured if anyone can give me some advice/ideas its gotta be reddit so does any of you know how I can make some money fast? Not a lot just to pay for passport and maybe get a haircut (haven't cut my hair in 16 months, Well okay thats not entirely true. Ive cut it myself and i've had others try it... But it looks horrible :/)	Reddit give me some advice on how to make cash fast.	612	11	needadvice
Hi Reddit. I am not a very athletic person, and on Friday I somehow managed to hurt myself while casually strolling downtown. I noticed a pain where my left leg meets my pelvic area. Since then the pain has intensified. \n It feels like a burning or tearing pain in the muscle, and is worst when I lift my torso, stand on my left leg, or shift weight off my left leg. Doing regular things like walking and going up and down steps hurts a lot too. I've been taking it easy all weekend but tomorrow I have to go back to work. My job isn't terribly strenuous but I do have to stand up pretty frequently and lift stacks of small items. I'm afraid the sort of movements I have to do could injure me more. \n Is there something I can do to alleviate the pain and ensure I don't damage myself? This really fucking hurts.

So, ever since High School I've wanted to get a job in psychology. I've always loved the study and it was the subject I excelled most in. \n(Aside from English and Art. Derp.) \n Fast Foreward to college - I start out by going to a community college, and do pretty well. In my second term, I take on two jobs and decide its a great idea to do online classes, since I'm so computer savvy. Herpderp. \n Guess not. I ended up failing all three classes I took, and was able to plead my case so that I wouldn't get my financial aid taken away. I was given a chance to fix it all come spring term. I took two classes (It was all I could afford) And despite the fact I got decent grades, it wasn't enough. I was told that I would have to pay for two more classes on my own, and bring my GPA up in order to continue to get financial aid. \n Fast-Foreward to now. I'm living 2,000 miles away from where I started, and the only way I'm going back to school is if I take out a private loan. I plan to do this through my bank, because there I can better plead my case, telling them where I went wrong and how I plan to do better. (There is no garuentee that I will get the aid, but I have to try.) \n For awhile, I was planning on getting my degree in psychology (I wanted to specialise in Human Sexuality.) but in the time I've taken off from school I've seen how everybody and their dog is a psych major, and how the profession is being overrun by grad students. I don't want to be stuck working at Denny's like so many other psychology graduates. But I'm having trouble thinking of something else I'd like to do with my life. \n I don't care about making tons of money - I can live happily in a small home with a dog and my husband. I just want to make enough to get by, get a vacation once a year, and be able to travel once in awhile. I think that living a modest life, while doing something I enjoy is more important than living an extravagant one while I am miserable 40 hours a week. \n As I said, I excelled in art and english in school, but those majors are just as bad as psychology. I find science facinating, but I don't think I'd be able to hold a job down in a scientific feild, unless it was pure research. (Which is hard enough to get as it is.) \n That was a lot more information than I planned on drowning you with. \n Here is the	Was going to get psych degree, realized how over run the industry is.

"For starters, I work for a major shipping company as a part-time supervisor. 6 months ago I was moved from a area I know very well to another area I know very little about in my job.

So, to start with some background information, I live with my boyfriend [25M] and his family because my family is abusive. I cut them off and got therapy and went on medication for my anxiety and depression. \n >I've always tried to do the right thing with my life but at 23 I feel lost. I first went to college to get a BA in Psychology but had no resources to get my Masters so I switched to nursing thinking that I could get a job with the limited resources I have (no car and no money at the time). I didn't make it into nursing school at my college of choice so I'm working on applying to a different college while working full time for my boyfriend's dad (which is perfect for having transportation because I still don't have a car but at least I have money now making 10 dollars an hour). \n >I'm just wondering if anyone knows of some option for a career in science where I can finally begin my adult life.

Obviously not my normal account. \n Here's the deal: for various unimportant reasons, I more or less dropped out of high school around tenth grade. Two years of personal but not academic growth later I got my GED and took the SATs, on which I did middlingly (760/610/670 critical reading, math, and writing respectively). \n Then some more unimportant things took place, and now it's two years later, and I'm 20 and freaking out about getting into college without guidance counselors, a GPA, or extracurricular activities. \n Compounding this is the fact that there is only one college I really want to get into, for mostly financial reasons. \n Mostly what I'm having trouble with is the admissions essay, in part because I'm really terrible at selling myself, but also because even after reading all sorts of things, I'm still not sure what the essay readers are really looking for. \n So,	Can I get into college, at 20, mostly on a good essay?

"Hi, \n The title says it all. I am a college graduate as of December 2010 (BSc in Economics) and am unemployed. I had a decent GPA and found a job quickly once I graduated... which I quickly began to hate due to the fact that it made me miserable... and I quit shortly after a year. \n I took some time off to recharge my batteries and temporarily moved back in with my parents to get my feet back under me (I still am there). I have spent the past 1.5 months actively applying for jobs, and while I have a few leads, I'm having a hard time becoming enthusiastic about any prospects due to the negative impact my first professional position had on me and I'm really at odds as to where I want to take my life from this point forward. \n Part of me regrets the major that I chose in college... While there are opportunities available to an economics degree holder, I feel as if many of them are for general and generic ""business"" positions and I'm undecided how I feel about gaining another one of these positions. I have the fear that it will end up like my first position and I will hate my life. Part of me regrets choosing the major I did over another major in an engineering-related field or a major that could lead to some sort of healthcare-related position. \n At the same time, I look back on some of the decisions I made in college and I regret not taking hold of the opportunities available to me. I never held an internship and was never particularly close with any of my professors in college (although I was a grader and the prof has agreed to let me use him as a reference)... These are things I regret and if I had a chance to go back I would want to try to become more involved in the academic aspect of college to try to forge some of these connections. I feel like because of the fact that I never held an internship, I lost out on valuable experience that could have helped me determine what type of job I should be looking for and now it's too late. \n More than anything else in life, I just want to find a career that I'm happy with. I'm not exactly a type ""A"" person, as I'm more easygoing and relaxed (I guess type ""B""), and I really feel as if the corporate rat race may not be right for me. \n How does one know what to devote their life to and what kind of job is right for them? Should I try going back to school for a different degree? How will I even know if I'm making the right job choice?

Short version: I'm Canadian & in the Environmental Science program, this is my fifth year in university, I have 18k in student loans, I estimate I'll finish by about summer/fall 2015. That's five to six semesters, 25-30k more in student loans. Is it worth it? \n Long version: I spent first year dicking around. Second year I entered Biology, still took a bunch of random classes so that slowed my progress. Also failed a lot of classes - basically I suck at physics, chemistry, and math and don't have the study skills to pass. Retook most, now I only have 1 chem and 1 math to do. \n Third year I moved out & started taking out loans. \n Fourth year (this past summer) I flunked out of my organic chem class, decided to switch to Environmental Science. Thought I would do a Biology minor since it's only 15 more credits. I'm passionate about the environment, also didn't want to do more organic chemistry or molecular biology & biochemistry. \n This year I sat down and looked at my program planner. I have 18 more classes, plus four biology classes if I want to do a bio minor. I can do four per semester max. I should add that my GPA is nothing spectacular (obviously) and I have some volunteer experience but no relevant work experience in my field. \n These are my options: \n \n Stay in school, graduate with a BSc, along with 50k in debt. \n \n Stay in school, graduate with a BSc and a Bio minor, add maybe 5-10k to that debt. \n \n Drop out of school, do who the fuck knows what.

I am going to University for elementary and special education. I really hate it. I've been a really happy person and had a bright look at life all my life but while I've been in school I've had some of the worst depression of my life. I can't emphasize how much I hate school. Just being in the building makes me sad and I feel like I don't belong there, I was really excited to be a teacher and don't want to do that anymore I've been thinking of going for counseling instead. My parents are paying for my school and have been paying for my rent. I hate taking money from them but I really need that to live. I've been a pretty good student all my life, I haven't had to put in a lot of effort but still got alright grades, got a 25 on the ACT, 3.4 in HS, and a 3.4 in college after freshman year. This year I was a pretty terrible student and this semester was a train wreck. I've always wanted to do comedy and wanted to try it out, I've been writing material all semester and found an open mic night. My current plans are to take at least a semester off and think about what I want to do, work, save as much money as I can, try out comedy and if it works move to California and try to make it and get into voice acting. I've always been the class clown/center of attention, I did some plays in middle school and like performing. I've always loved traveling and always wanted to explore the states. I've wanted to travel in ways other people don't often, in high school I tried getting my friends to train hop with me, but they didn't want to and I abandoned that. I've been looking at  and it seems pretty awesome, I have an uncle that could help me get my van livable. I've always wanted to do stuff I think would be really cool and basically gave up on them trying because of other people/my parents/myself. I really want to go for this and see how it works. \n My parents are somewhat behind me but they say I should get my degree before I try any of that. My only problem is I don't have the motivation or hope for a college degree/future that I'm not trying to get good grades and/or not doing the required work so theres really no point for me to go if I'm not gonna do my best. \n I want to know what you guys think, should I suck it up and stay in school or should I go for my dream and what I believe will make me happy instead? \n I'll try to reply to every comment so let me know what you think, thanks.\nEven if you just say yes/no it'll be appreciated	OP wants to live in a van and drop out of school, parents don't like idea.

Hey everyone, I am a 21 year old loser (by society's standards) and I'm starting to believe it too. \n Okay so here is the problem that is my life. My license is currently suspended because at the time of the suspension i did not have enough money to pay for car insurance and also being a dumb young kid out on my own. My previous insurance carrier notified the dmv my plan expired. After my license was suspended i drove my car on a suspended license and uninsured to a job. I eventually made enough money to pay for a six month insurance premium (2,200$) (esurance) the dmv told me i had to get an sr-22 which basically is a document from the insurance company that states i did pay for a six month premium that is needed in order to reinstate license needed by the dmv. \n During those happy six months of driving insured i lost my job (restaurant) and now i was left with less than 2,200$ that was needed to buy another 6 month premium. I also needed 250$ on top of that as a reinstatement fee. As of now i just recently my broken car (engine) for 4,000$ and i have 1,000$ in my account from my tax return. So i have 5,000$ no car and a suspended license. If i were to use the money i have to spend on reinstatement it would leave me with 2,200$. Assuming esurance will still let me hold a policy. \n I would like to buy another car for at least 4-5,000$ so i don't have to spend all my money on repairs and maintenance. I have no credit, my parents are not in a financial position to help me and biking to a job is tough due to extreme heat, rain, and location relative to places of employment. My only plausible option that i have thought of is the bus system and i would prefer not to take that route. (no pun intended) \n If you have any questions or any solutions i am unaware of please PLEASE notify me. I am forever grateful for anyone who can or will take time out of their day to help me. \n **	License suspended, seeking information about reinstatement options that would cost less than $2,700.	370	13	needadvice
So I really need advice and/or help... I'm tired of my lack of friends to hang out with, I'm getting pretty depressed, and as much as I enjoy talking with them - online friends aren't cutting it anymore. I've been trying to figure out what to on my own for a long time now and I just can't think of anything, it's really getting to me. Even just some good ideas on where to start would be amazing.

I didn't want to post this and bother anyone, but I'm completely fed up with my country (India) and want to leave it and settle elsewhere, in a better country. Sadly, my country is going downhill in terms of progress and there's no scope of it improving anytime in near future. People here are highly conservative, are obsessed with their culture, are racist, sexists, lack entrepreneurial spirit and are hypocrites. \n Furthermore the aesthetics here are awful, here's a post about it: \n I'm been working day and night online and have been earning more than any salaried individual here. Do I get any respect for that? Nope, People just fail to realize that one can be an entrepreneur and earn a living. And banks deny any loans to a self employed person, right away (I needed one for my business). \n There's no scope of running a business here, and so I registered my company in US some years ago and have been working through it from India. \n Now to the point, I want to leave this country and settle in a developed country (preferably US/Canada) but both of those require an outsider to get a job there to get a work visa (and eventually citizenship). There's no way a self employed person could get a visa. Though, I've an awesome portfolio and would get a job easily but that doesn't make sense. I never wanted to do a job in the first place, and I'm earning better than from any job. \n I'm really upset regarding this issue. Any suggestions would be appreciated. \n PS..

As stated in the title, I'm 16, and I am not exactly sure what career to pursue.\nI am currently enrolled in a community college (have been since I was 15). I have narrowed down my career path to two choices, but I am having trouble picking. one is music, the other is engineering. I have been learning advanced math since i was 13, and have been building robots and working on various other electronic devices since then as well, and I've taken digital logic (one of the core courses). \nThe other thing I would really like to do is music. I had a constant urging to play the piano when I was 4. However, my piano teacher was a horrible teacher, and very mean, way over the top, so I quit music till 9, when I picked up the drums. Then at 10 or so I did violin, for a while, but I soon lost interest. When i was 14 i started guitar, and have been playing that for 2 years now, I can learn pretty much anything on it now. I also know music theory, not ridiculously advanced but I have taken a few classes and done really well in them. And I am thinking of starting the piano, the first musical instrument I tried. I want to be a composer of film scores preferably(the odds of success are akin to the odds of getting into the NFL, but i do have some tracks already), and I am in a good area for music... the only thing is, I have no idea what the first step is, and if I am extremely discouraged because every professional piano player started when they were 7, and studied for 10 years or so before going to music school. I don't even really know HOW to get into music school honestly, or what I should be doing right now with music. So, what should I do? I feel like if I don't figure out know it will be too late to do anything. \n [	I want to go to college for music (started playing14), need to know if it's to late, need to know what steps I should take, or if i should just do engineering]	342	32	needadvice
Hi all, I'm a mechanical engineering student and I'm trying to decide whether I should just stick to school and get my degree or try to find a paid internship/job and take a break or attend classes part time. \n For some background, I am a third year student and it will take at least 2 more years to graduate at my current university. It originally was going to take 4 years total. Hence my problem: \n I've simply become completely unmotivated to do anything school-related. It's been this way (steadily becoming worse) since my second semester here. (Though I've had a chronic procrastination problem since high school.) I used to be a 3.8 GPA student in high school. Now I'm barely keeping a 3.1 and it's dropping rapidly. Once I got to college, it just all went to shit. There have been a couple of classes that have maintained my interest, but I shirk the homework/attendance even for those. The one thing for which I've been able to maintain stellar attendance/motivation for is work. I currently am working two on-campus jobs and love my coworkers (and of course the fact that I'm earning money). \n I still have an avid interest in engineering as a career (or so I think) and I have an aptitude for designing/building/modeling things (or so I've been told), it's just the classes that bring me down. I'm not interested whatsoever in calculating the velocity of a fluid through a pipe, really. And yet I have to take 3 different classes that all require you to do that very thing. \n Thus, I've recently come to the conclusion that maybe I'm just not meant to be in school anymore. I want to be working. The other, more obvious possibilities being that I'm simply terribly lazy or stressed/overworked or in the wrong major. I honestly can't think of a job more interesting than engineering, though (I get all giddy reading my possible future job descriptions), so I really don't think that's it. It's just the required coursework that I dislike. \n So, I'm looking for advice. I know it would be extremely hard to near-impossible to get a job in engineering without a degree (and with my grade history), but I know it would be much more enjoyable to me than my next couple of years of classes. Most of my classes make me miserable, but at the same time, it's only 2 more years of my life that I'd have to endure that misery (though they'd feel like millenia as I trudge through them). So what's your verdict? If the latter, how can I force myself to see the light at the end of the tunnel and just  get my shit done ? Alternatively, how can I make myself love even the classes that I dread? \n (Also, just so I get these suggestions out of the way: I have tried therapy, ADHD meds, and depression meds for prolonged periods of time and none have gotten me out of my funk. So don't suggest any of those.)	I no longer have the slightest bit of motivation to do coursework in my much-beloved engineering major. Should I struggle through anyways for the payoff or should I try a different route, find a job in my field, and finish my degree later? Is it because of laziness, stress, lost interest, or because I'm just not meant to be at school anymore? \n Thanks in advance!	506	65	needadvice
"I'm male, 20, 6'4"" and 275lbs. I inherited high blood pressure from every male ancestor for 2 generations, and my doctor wants me to lower my sodium intake. (Also, I want to lose weight, not due to doctor's suggestion) Today I wrote down everything I ate (for the first time) and their Calorie and sodium content. In just over 1500 Calories, there was almost 5 grams of sodium. I didn't eat anything really that bad - I had no breakfast, a hot pocket (the only ""bad"" thing, imo) and a ham sandwich for a late lunch, and 2 grilled brats (that's a bratwurst - I heard somewhere that calling them brats is a great lakes idiom) for dinner. \n So my questions are (also, start here for"	1) How can I lower my sodium without just eating less and thus dying of starvation? \n 2) What tricks do you have to avoid being ridiculously hungry all the time in the beginning? (from other reddit discussions on weight loss, I understand this goes away with time) \n Thanks	126	48	needadvice
This is my first time posting so sorry if I'm doing this wrong or in the wrong sub. \n My fiance is absolutely gorgeous and I tell her this every day, but she has always had problems with her self esteem as she was seriously abused as a child and has had a really tough life. Last March she shaved her head for charity and donated the hair to a charity which makes wigs for children, and she looked beautiful with no hair, but since then we have decided to get married in March 2016 and the only thing she wants is to feel beautiful on her wedding day. She wears hats to cover her hair all the time and absolutely hates it as she can't straighten it at the moment due to it being so short, so yesterday she went for a consultation at a salon that specialises in permanent hair straightening and extensions for people with short hair. Unfortunately she came home in floods of tears as they told her that the entire service she wanted would cost \xa32000 which there is no way we can afford. \n I have tried telling her that she looks beautiful regardless and that she doesn't need them but she is just devastated and keeps saying that she'll be the ugliest person on her wedding day and that with everything she's been through she wanted to feel beautiful for one day. \n So my question is does anyone have any advice on how to raise the \xa32000? I started a cyber begging page this morning but I don't expect to have any luck because obviously to a lot of people this won't seem like a big deal and the message 'can I have money for my partner's hair extensions' isn't a very moving one, but actually to her it really matters and I really want her to feel special and to see herself how I see her every day and I'd do anything for her to have that. \n We also don't have anything valuable enough that we can sell to make that amount of money \n So if anyone has any suggestions it would be greatly appreciated	Fiance shaved her head for charity and thinks she'll be ugly on our wedding day so I want to help her raise \xa32000 for extensions so she feels good about herself	361	31	needadvice
Math has always been a bit of a struggle for me and I knew College Algebra wasn't going to be any different. I started at my community college in an intermediate algebra class but I bombed the first test and was moved to basic algebra which I then passed with a B from what I recall. I then took Intermediate Algebra which was challenging but I passed with a C. Last semester was my first time taking College Algebra and I made the mistake of overloading myself by taking a total of 16 credits while also working a part time job. With that being said, at the end of the semester I ended up withdrawing from College Algebra to not sink my GPA. \n &nbsp; \n Now fast forward to the present, I'm taking College Algebra again and I'm still struggling with tests. I feel that I have a general understanding of the material but when I get to the test I crumble. I go to all the classes, do all my homework, take all of the notes, and I even have talked to my teacher for help but I just don't seem to be making any progress. My first test I had a 58% but after reviewing it I was surprised to find a lot of it was just tiny dumb mistakes. I can get pretty bad test anxiety so I believe that's what may have been a cause for the mistakes. \n &nbsp; \n Now recently I took my second test and feel that I may have done a bit better but not as well as I had hoped. Preparing for the test, I looked over all my notes and read all of the sections in the chapter a few days before the test. The day before the test I had to unfortunately work so whenever I had the chance I was doing the test review. Then came the day of the test I had at least two hours to look over my test review and whatever other materials I wanted to look over. Going into the test I was pretty confident but then it seemed to slowly go downhill from there. \n &nbsp; \n I've been making tweaks to help improve myself but nothing is seeming to work. I know I could definitely get more sleep, read material before class, and practice more but I'm just struggling to find a way to do well in College Algebra. I've read the book a Mind for Number which has helped a bit but I guess not enough since my last test didn't go as well as I thought it would. Any advice when it comes to learning math, note taking, or preparing for and taking math tests is greatly appreciated. \n &nbsp;	Taking College Algebra for 2nd time.

I apologise now for the rambling that is about to go down.\nI'm 17 and currently living in a psychiatric Hospital as I am struggling with depression, anxiety and borderline personality disorder.\nDuring group therapy, I learnt that love (from others or from yourself) is very helpful when trying to fill an emotional void.\nFrom this theory, I decided to make a self-love jar. What it means is that I'll have a jar full of popsicle sticks and every popsicle stick will have a self-love suggestion on it. Each day I will pick one stick randomly from the jar and do what it says, in effort to increase my view of myself by doing nice things for myself.\nWhat I need help with is ideas for what to write on the sticks. I have a few ideas (which I will list in a comment), but I need more; I'm not the best with ideas. \nThank you so much :) I really appreciate it <3	Help me with suggestions of nice things to do by myself	164	11	needadvice
I'm currently a senior in HS and I realized that I haven't done much in my 18 years of life. My peers all have an outstanding transcripts (all A's) and/or leadership skills and some talent to make them stand out. \n But I stand right in the middle with decent grades (A's and B's an a few C's) Lots of AP courses with 4's and 3's. SAT with a little above 2000 and ACT of 34. Some club experience but no leadership. No real awards and ongoing extracurricular. A typical part-time job and some volunteer work. \n I want to do better and I know that if I start now I still have a chance, however since I don't have much to stand on it's hard to gain experience.\nWhat do I do now? I'm afraid I won't do better in college since my peers will have a better resume, so the professors will prefer them and they'll gain the leadership opportunities and internships and such... \n (Also I seem to notice that CS majors typically go into college with a fair amount of programming/techy knowledge, while I only know a bit of Java.)

Hello! I'm a little jarred right now and could use some advice/words of wisdom and/or encouragement. \n My mom and dad got divorced when I was 7 and separated when I was 4. I'm an older teen now and have since lived with my mother, aunt and grandparents... So, several years. I used to visit my dad on school holidays (we lived in Tennessee and he in southern Missouri so the drive wasn't heinous). That ended in 2010 for a (bullsh*t) reason imposed by my grandparents. But I always had a good time with him and for the most part loved staying there because it was more of a family dynamic (I'm more like friends with my mom), and he has custody of my half sister. \n I haven't seen him in 6!!! years. But we've kinda remained in contact on Facebook and he's recently reintroduced himself into my life, nicely and much less resentful of my mom this time. She's less resentful as well and doesn't mind the idea so much, outside of missing me. I've wanted to live with him before when I was younger for less logical reasons but I have no real problems w/ my mom. \n Here's where I'm scared. I live in Florida now, so it's really not feasible for me to jump back and forth trying to decide. I'm pretty positive I'd do LOGICALLY better with my father tho. He's better off financially, more of a 'parent' parent and while I'm a bit of a social recluse and a lazy person, he does fun stuff and goes places all the time so I'd be doing that too. He's also in a good place to help me get a job and a car (which is seeming damn near impossible to manage here for reasons). \n However, I'm scared he won't like me or we'll clash dramatically. I'm not super liberal, but way more left/moderate than he is and I don't wanna disappoint or offend him. I'm also scared he'll get frustrated with me during the adjustment period as I have an anxiety and mood disorder that effect new interactions with people and makes me kinda quiet and awkward. I do think it'd be a nice way to start over and get out of this little Podunk town, though. I also have kind of a vulgar sense of humor and way I talk, as well as a liking for (some drugs) and drinking but for a job I'll stop that anyway. He's kinda strict about that stuff soooo I'm worried. He's also Christian and I'm not a believer at all and I'm scared it'll be forced on me. \n Another thing is, in typical dad fashion, he disapproves of any and all boys. But I have a long distance b/f of a very long time that I'm afraid moving in with my dad will impede on. My mom knows about, likes and supports him and I but I'm scared he won't and I don't wanna lose him. \n Does anybody have any stories/advice about facing the decision and the culture/family(?) shock that comes with it? I'll be doing a 180 from my normal lazy, do nothing, stay in all day,  running in circles life. I'll also have to leave my dog here and she's adored by my mom so I know she'll be taken care of, but still. :(	I'm a teenager with anxiety/etc faced with the decision of leaving her family situation of many, many years. It'll be better for me financially and realistically, but I'm scared about the more personal stuff.	558	34	needadvice
Hello everyone! \n My name's Guillaume (don't even try to pronounce it you english-speakers), I'm an 18 french homeschooled student from Lyon, France.\nAnd I'd need some advice about how to get into Ivy League schools. \n I have kind of an impetuous background: I was an excellent student, however I dropped school at 15, and then lived for one year in a host family.

However, I only have a vague idea about what is expected to get in - I know that 4.0 GPA and triple 800s at the SAT is pretty kewl to have, also having a nice extracurricular background, but that's pretty much all I know about the admission process right now. \n So, we get to the	I'm an 18yo french student with an uncommon background who will graduate from high school at 20, do I have any hope of getting into Yale, and what are some useful tips to make it happen? \n Thanks for your time, and best regards from France :) .	193	47	needadvice

"This is something I was thinking about for a while now and was wishing to get some opinions on. In real life events that preceded  and follow a crime are generally of a local nature. In other words, if you see a crime being committed it usually happens right in front of you and you know immediately to call the police and they should be able to handle it from there. The crime happened, you saw it, and had no active role in it. \n With the Internet however, things can spring up on you that muddy the waters, and I'd like your input. What follows is a hypothetical situation. \n Joe logs into his PC and starts browsing the Internet. He finds an interesting link on a reputable site that leads him to another site, that while it is not as well known, is still a safe site. Then he finds a link to an FTP site that is offering free access to upload and download files. Joe logs in, downloads some cute pictures of cats and maybe a movie or two. He notices a file called ""BBC wildlife documentary"". Upon downloading it, he realizes this is in no way a BBC production but something far worse, say Child Porn. He informs the FTP site owner who traces the IP to an Internet anonymizer network and immediately deletes the files and bans the IP and network. \n So what should Joe do next? Since he didn't know what it was, and it was reported to the owner of the server, does his duty as a human being end, or should he call the police? \n I ask this as a moral or ethical question, not necessarily a legal one since laws change. \n What do you think? \n In summation ("	Joe found something illegal, reported it, it was deleted and the source is difficult to trace, possibly spanning several countries.

Hi R/Advice, \n My girlfriend is 22, and has been living at a co-worker's house for about four months now. Four months ago, after a domestic dispute, her alcoholic mother told her that she was no longer welcome at their house anymore and that she had to find someplace else to live. Her solution was to take two suitcases of clothes/necessities and stay with a co-worker until she could either go back to her parents or find an apartment of her own. Her legal address is still her parents' house. \n Last night, while her parents were still on vacation, she went back to the parents' house to see if she could pick up the rest of her possessions, but found her bedroom completely empty; the bed, all her clothes, jewelry, small pieces of furniture, etc\u2014everything had been removed. Today, my gf spoke to her mother and found out that all of her things had been thrown out as garbage over the last two months. She was given no prior notice nor any sort of warning from her parents that her possessions were to be trashed. \n So, R/Advice, what should she do? My first thought was to file a police report. Would that be useful in a domestic case like this? I'm not really sure about the best course of action here, so any help would be appreciated. \n Thanks,\nCthulhusandwich	My gf's entire bedroom's worth of possessions were thrown out maliciously by her crazy, unstable parents while she had been living with a co-worker for the last 4 months.	228	29	needadvice
Hi Reddit, \n I do not like what I am studying now (Business), I only took it because I knew I could score well in it if I put in the effort to study, and also because my parents say that getting a diploma in what I like (mass communications) is 'useless'. This also seems pretty lame but I also went into Business because I thought the school culture would be fun, but no. \n But in order to enter the course, I just said that I liked business... WELL, yes I do intend to start my own business in the future... but yeah. \n Sure enough, I've a rather good GPA of 3.7 out of 4.0. But honestly I feel so drained whenever I do my assignments because it really bores me, and I don't see the point in pursuing a business degree, honestly how many successful entrepreneurs even have one? \n and now I know that I would much rather do something I like & gain more experiences out of it. \n Here is the situation, I can't transfer courses anymore because it's my second out of three years. \n I can either choose to fight to defer one semester in order to take marketing communications, which is the most closely linked 'specialisation' to my field of interest -- mass communications, because I really like to design and honestly I love the media industry even though I may not go into it in the future... I guess it's just the self motivation to learn more about it even though I don't necessarily have to, like how to photoshop and how to use illustrator, teaching myself in the process! \n Or I can choose not to defer (which the school wants me to do) and just specialise in entrepreneurship & marketing (without the design aspect...), and I feel so tired just thinking about that. And I know for sure after I complete my studies, I probably won't want to go into mass comm because I am not interested in the overly theoretical aspects of it, I want hands on experience and at where I live, my school is the one of the best places for that. \n If I manage to defer school, I would really like to intern in a media company! Either that or nutrition, which is my second field of interest! \n Yet if anyone asks me what I would want for a future career, it will be most likely to be nutrition, as I feel its more sustainable and able to impact others lives more! :)	Is it wise to defer school for a semester in order to specialise in my field of interest, or just finish up whatever I am studying even though I am bored to death with it???	422	35	needadvice

"I think it's generally agreed upon that politics can be a nasty topic of conversation for some people, and that's certainly true for my ultra-conservative grandmother (who I grew up with and am very close to). From our discussions in the past, before I learned to not talk about politics with her, she knows that I'm a liberal democrat (as are my siblings). She's a wonderful woman who loves us deeply, but she really, really hates liberals and makes it known. \n In person, she'd often say things out of nowhere like, ""I just don't understand why liberals are such hateful people,"" or, ""I don't understand why liberals hate America so much."" (Almost sounds like she's being sarcastic, but she's not). It always felt like she was baiting me, and I used to respond, attempting to show her those things weren't true, but soon realized any response sends her into an angry tirade so I learned to just breathe deep and change the subject. \n I've since moved to a different state, and we see each other less -- but she's on Facebook a lot. Our direct communication is often good-natured, but she's taken to posting statuses similar to what she used to say, like, ""How can all you liberals let Obama lie to you and ruin our country?

But when I read this stuff, I feel like she's insulting me since she knows my views and knows that I'm going to be reading it. My husband, on the other hand, just laughs it off and it doesn't bother him much at all. \n I know better than to respond at this point, but I guess I'm looking for others opinions: Is it stupid that this upsets me? Am I being overly sensitive, and making impersonal things personal? Or is she really being insulting to me and my siblings when she says stuff like this? What do you all think is a reasonable response? \n (In case anyone tells me to hide/delete her on Facebook -- I've hid her statuses in the past but I end up missing out on a lot because she posts pictures/details about her life a lot, when she's not posting political stuff, so I unhid her.

"Ok this is a long one. Let's start out with his family. We are both 14. My friend (let's call him Matthew) goes back and forth between his mom and dad and they've been doing this for years. That's not the problem. He has a brother that is from a different dad that is 4 years older then him. He now lives full time with his dad. Matthew is now the only child living with his mom every other week. \n Matthews mom (let's call her Susan) has obviously broken up with Matthew and Matthews brothers dad. Now she found someone new (let's call him Carl) and he has a daughter (let's call her Beth) who is 4 years old. Matthew has heard many noises if you know what I mean from Susan and Carl. and some I was on face time with him. Carl and Beth sleep over every night for the past 2 years. Carl makes jokes like Matthew says"" can I have a balloon(summarizing it) "" and Carl says ""yeah I think I have one at the bottom of my gym bag."" and so on. \n Susan lives in a townhouse that has 2 bedrooms living room kitchen and basement. Beth is now sleeping in Matthews old room and now Matthew sleeps in the basement on a mattress. Beth takes his old toys, video games, money, hides his stuff regularly and his Susan says things like ""Oh shut up Matthew she's 4 years old"" and he doesn't have anything except for a mattress and none of his old toys. Beth now has a queen size bed (Matthew used to sleep on a twin) and can take anything she wants, eats all of Matthews snacks, and sleeps there every night. \n Susan has taken Matthews phone away for about 3 months which Matthews dad is paying for, and we can't find it on his Apple ID on find my iPhone so we have some theories that she gave it to Beth and changed the Apple ID and that explains why we can't find it, either. On top of that, Matthew does a ridiculous amount of chores and earns zero dollars. We FaceTime on his iPad. \nWhat the hell does he do?

"Ok this might be long, I'd appreciate it if even one person gave me their insight on my situation. \n I live in Canada, I'm a pretty good soccer player (Club soccer, school soccer, provincial team), also a really big gamer and I guess you could say I'm having a little struggle in life right now. I've been in my first year of high school for one semester now, and being Asian, I took the typical IB all subjects courses. I was pretty good at school until now and I think it's really because of my laziness. I'm was really struggling with math and science, for one reason because I was really lazy during class, always on Reddit, sleeping, not paying attention and because of that I didn't understand a lot of concepts during class. During the year, my marks weren't that bad with the ""Asian standard"". Usually 80s for tests and quizzes. But really, I wasn't the best student. I always cheated off my smart friend in science and in math I crammed the last night. But the finals came along, and I got a 76 final mark in math, scoring a 70 in the final exam, and a 74 in science, scoring a 65 on the final exam. The reason for a low math mark was that I kind off understood concepts, but gaming during the study week and just laziness in general didn't help me remember them very much. And science, I really just didn't look at much of the material, before high school I had always been pretty good a science. Now, my parents want me to go to Kumon (not sure if the US has it but its basically a tutor building). They say I have to go, or stop playing soccer. I really want to keep playing soccer, it's a passion for me and really a way of life I have never lived without. \n I might have left a lot of information up, I'm just really angry/sad/confused right now. And some of you might say ""oh 70's aren't that bad of a mark."" Well for an Asian boy like me, parents are really strict. And I just don't want to lose my freedom, like playing video games on the weekend, soccer almost everyday, it's my life. You might say, ""oh just study your ass off everyday"" but school life isn't like that. You have friends, you want to fit in with the ""popular"" kids. I just want to have a good life. (Also I can't really improve my mark for math/science, they are final marks and the course has ended now)"	"Asian kid in Canada, loves playing soccer/video games, ""failed"" math/science.

Hey Reddit. I had to create a throwaway for this as my mother knows my reddit username. \n I am 25 years old and always told my self I would look for my father when I am 25. I don't know why but ever since I was ten that was what I told my self. \n Now my mother left my father with me and moved to another country when I was 7 as she could no longer deal with his gambling and alcohol addiction. I have heard from my aunt that he has quit alcohol and gambling and has started a new family. My aunt (my mothers sister) however has not talked to my father in over 10 years. My aunt is also the last person to contact my father. \n I do not know if it is a good idea, but I really do want to find him and meet him for some reason. I don't know exactly why but I do. But one part of me is afraid of the consequences. I married my dream girl and she recently gave birth to my son. I am working my dream job working as a structural engineer and recently put down a big deposit for a mortgage. I do not want my life to change as I am very happy but I do not want that to be an excuse for not finding out about a person who helped raise me for seven years and also I do not want to break a promise I made to myself for so many years.

"I have been getting increasingly unhappy for a few years now...nothing major but, with the exception of a few good days a month, I'm grumpy, irritable, tired, withdrawn, bored, dissatisfied, etc. I've been trying to ""change my life"" this year and have succeeded in eliminating some things that actively make me unhappy, but I still haven't been able to work up the will or motivation to start doing things that actively make me HAPPY. So I want to start seeing a therapist. \n It's recently occurred to me that I might have some form of depression (blah blah blah) and I've made an appointment with my doctor, but because of various bureaucratic reasons, the appointment isn't until August.

I'm a licensed wildlife rehabber and was/am a part of a group on FB called Squirrels which had about 1,500 members. It's a public group where anyone can join. On Sunday an ex-Navy submariner joined and started posting pictures of dead squirrels. He began adding friends to the group. They posted graphic photos of smashed squirrels, tortured squirrels, etc. Now there are over 70 ex-Navy submariners on there (all late 40s-50s). They are saying sexually graphic stuff to us, threatening some with death (the person is too scared to call the police despite us offering support). We block them and they make new accounts. We've made new groups and they keep sneaking in even if it's closed or private. \n We report all photos for animal cruelty, graphic violence, threats of violence, and even have screen shots, but FB never removes it. The admin of the original group isn't responding, so we made new groups, but these submariners make fake profiles and it only takes one to get their friends in.\nI know that the answer is going to be just give up being in a squirrel group, but for a lot of us we are solitary and no one can offer emotional and experience support for rescuing these small mammals. Why won't FB do anything? What do we do since we and the offenders are all in different states?\nThis sucks mostly :(	We have even tried making new groups, but they make fake profile & sneak in.

"BACKSTORY \n So I want to buy some Jordan 11 Space Jams(~$400), which is a bit too expensive for me.Then I met this guy on Reddit who can get me a pair of Space Jams for about $200. They are ""replica"" shoes, not authentic, but are 99.9% identical to a real pair of Space Jams, with very very minute defects. He has his own pair and showed me pictures of the ""replicas"" and they look dead on like the real deal. He got them from this sketchy Chinese website, and even though some people on Youtube have reviewed the site, I still dont trust them. They dont use PayPal and I dont want to give them credit card/personal info. \n MY DEAL \n Since the guy has bought from that sketchy site and is comfortable with them, he said he is willing to buy me a pair of shoes from there with his own money. And I will pay him back, plus like $50 interest. So he will spend $200 of his own money, and I pay him back $250, so he essentially makes $50. \n THE PROPOSAL \n My offer was that I pay him AFTER I receive the shoes, which usually the seller ships the item after the buyer pays. Here was my plan, first, he buys the shoes from the site with his own money. Then he ships them to a local USPS or postal office near me. I then sign off the package, acknowledging that I  received the shoes, then I pay for the shoes, which leaves him really vulnerable. \n THE DILEMMA \n I really want to pay him AFTER I receive the shoes, which protects me from getting scammed. Because if I pay first, he can just take off with my money or if I receive the shoes, and I find out they are terrible quality, I cant return them. So I would like to pay after, but that is also incredibly unfair to the seller. Because now, I can just take off with the shoes. So now that leads me to my question:"	MAIN QUESTION \n Is there a way I can buy these shoes from the guy, that is safe for BOTH of us?

I'm pretty worried about my history grade and math as well (quite less) and I'd like some reassurance/encouragement(/hate cause I'm a teen go ahead) so here is where my questionning begins. 1-Do you believe that I will pass my history class considering I got 48% on the final exam and a have a class average of definitely minimum 70%? 2-Considering the class average is 65 so the government may increase peoples' grades because a lot of people failed? (I don't know if it's a QC thing but gov. grade increases aren't uncommon) 3-This one isn't technical really not at all and more just to comfort me haha but how well do you believe I'll do on nevermind this is pointless and inaccurate. I guess for those who wanted to know; I wanted you to estimate  my chance of passing the math gov. exam considering I start with 90/100 cause I didn't have time for a 10 point question but ya as I said it's inaccurate and useless due to lack of information [instead I spent my last 10 minutes on two 4-point questions I was unsure of]  thanks to those who answer	I got 48% on my provincial history exam, it's average is 65% (so possible grade boosts due to fails) and I have minimally (max:85) a class average of 70 on 100.

Hello Reddit, \n Over the years I've seen a lot of people get some great advice here. I'm in a difficult time in my life and certainly could use some advice. \n Long story short I was in an abusive relationship for a long time that reached a breaking point 3 years ago when I became severely depressed and could no longer cope. I filed for divorce to which my ex responded by taking our daughter and moving away to another city. In my depressed state, instead of fighting to have my daughter brought back I fell deeper into depression. I started drinking very heavily; I was already accustomed to pretty much getting drunk at a bar every night just to avoid going home and fighting with my ex. Now I was drinking pretty much around the clock, pretty soon I started doing coke as well. \n I had a great job at this time and a career that I worked towards for 10 years. Soon after my ex moved our child away from me I got arrested for possession and assault . I lost my job as a result of this becoming public (I worked with sensitive financial information). \n In a way this was the wake up call. I plead guilty to my charges , received a sentence of community service but also now have a criminal record. \n I've spent the last 2 years clean and sober. I represented myself through a bitter divorce, filed for bankruptcy . But I managed to get my daughter back in my life and I also managed to find a job before I was sentenced. I'm also in a very healthy and supportive relationship, and I'm happy in a way that I could have never imagined. \n The job that I have now; while I'm thankful for it, is as dead end as it gets. I receive Job offers from recruiters on a regular basis. I'm confident in my skills and value that I can provide to an employer. So far however I've been nervous about seeking work due to my criminal record .  I live and work in OTTAWA which is a city that's small enough that it's very easy for information about an individual to get around. \n Being able to acquire a different job, one that pays for my experience and has the potential to allow me to rebuild my career would be huge. Not only for my self esteem, but in terms of building a better life for my new partner and my daughter. At this point I've several great job offers but I'm crippled by how to respond due to the background check I know I surely must pass. \n So I guess my question is, I'd like to hear from this in Canada / Ottawa who have a criminal record and what their experience has been like trying to rebuild their life / career. If you're an employer or a person in charge of hiring I'd love to hear your perspective on how you would deal with a candidate that you're very interested in  but you find out they have a criminal record unrelated to their job and for reasons that are quite in the past... \n Thanks for reading	Went through a bad depression, became addicted to drugs , have a criminal record as a result.

"I have an interview tomorrow for a position that will require relocation to another state after completion of job training. Specifically, it'll require me to move from Las Vegas, NV to Kearney, NE. \n I honestly don't mind relocating, as the company's going to pay relocation expenses, and I wouldn't mind seeing water and getting out of the desert. However that comes at the cost of moving smack dab in the middle of tornado alley. \n I do have some other, more realistic concerns though. For starters, the ad they posted listed a very specific, very low salary. The average salary for a person with my experience(14+ years) and qualifications should be in the mid $40,000 range. This company's job listing stated the salary for the position is $31,200 after training. \n I don't really expect them to come up all the way to $45,000 since the listing is only seeking to hire someone with 1-2 years experience, but I'm not really prepared(or willing) to put myself in a position where I can barely afford to pay my rent and utilities just so they can drive the wage down in my field. \n Additionally, the position requires a lot of ""local"" travel(2+ hours each way in some instances) but I'll be using a company vehicle/gas card for getting to these places. Even still, I'm not sure if I'll be allowed the use of the company vehicle for my daily commute, or if I'll need a personal vehicle for commuting to/from a central office. \n I realize the latter is more likely the case, but that does create an additional set of living expenses(car payment, car insurance, fuel, maintenance) since there's not going to be a public transportation option. With rent(7-800)/utilities(2-300)/homeowners insurance, food and the addition of a State Income Tax it just seems like this job needs to pay more to be worthwhile. I did the math, and after payroll deductions for the Federal Income Tax, State Income Tax, and Social Security the weekly take home would only be $440.68 it doesn't seem feasible unless I'm eating Ramen 7 days a week. \n I'm hoping to get them to come up 6-8 grand at least. To be clear this is a multi-million dollar company, not some struggling mom/pop business just starting to expand. \n I realize most companies don't care if they pay enough to meet your living expenses, but how and when do I go about bringing these concerns up as leverage to raise the wage? In the correspondence with their HR contact I said ""I'd be excited to come in and discuss the position and compensation package"" \n I'm curious, when is the best time to bring up salary negotiations? I've heard some people say after they've offered the job? I've heard others say whoever brings up salary first has less leverage in negotiations. Wouldn't their posting a salary in the job listing be them bringing up salary? \n I hope some of you redditors have some ideas/suggestions or feedback as to what to expect. Just to be clear, the salary figure I quoted(for someone with my experience) came directly from salaryexpert.com it's not a random figure. \n Thanks"	Interviewing Thursday for a new job, posted salary is far too low to be worth accepting	521	16	needadvice
I've been living abroad for almost a year now. I'm down to my last two weeks, then I go on a goodbye-roadtrip before I go back home. My problem is, I really REALLY don't want to. \n Before I left I had a tough time the last couple of years at home. I'd lost a job that I loved and couldn't get my shit together career-wise, struggling with being introverted and having social anxieties, becoming more and more distant from my friends and things in the dating-department weren't going smoothly either (imagine tumbleweed. Just one, that's how lonely I was). In short, I felt like absolute crap most of the time. \n I then found out about the Working Holiday program and decided to move abroad. I saved up and left late summer last year. Since then I have been doing so much better. I met a guy who introduced me to a group of people who I've grown to love during these last few months. \n They are all super cool people and hanging out with them and being in a different country and speaking another language have had such a good influence on me. Being a foreigner is great here. People hear your accent and are immediately genuinely interested in you and your story. It's a great conversation starter and way to meet new people. I also have actually come to the point where I feel more comfortable speaking English and prefer it to my native language. \nWhereas before my anxiety was bad (scared of sitting next to people on the bus, terrified of answering the phone) I am the social one now. I will without problem strike up a conversation with a stranger. I can easily make friends here, something that seemed so impossibly hard before. I have so much more self esteem here. I've even started up building a network for my freelance career, something that was really going somewhere but now has become useless. I cannot see myself doing the same thing at home.\nAlso I feel the general way of thinking and living here fits in with how I see things WAY more than back home. People are also waaayy more open to new people and things than where I live. \n And now I have to go back. To where I was SO miserable. \nDon't get me wrong. I am SUPER excited to see my family again. I love them to death and have missed them terribly. Also the few friends I haven't lost touch with. But I feel like my home is here now. I love these people, I LOVE this city, I love this version of me and I actually feel loved. It wasn't perfect, and there were tough times (financially, mostly) but I'd take having less money and feeling this happy over a million dollars any day. And I am scared and convinced that the moment I set foot on home soil it'll all be like before. The anxity, loneliness, boredom, ...My oldest friends are all in different stages of their lives compared to me, and I have nothing in common with them. I'll live in a city that I before thought was cool, but compared to where I live now it seems small and dull. I'll have lost my edge, I'll be like everyone else again. \n How do I deal with this?! :'(	Found a home away from home that now feels like my new home and I don't want to go back home. \n Edit: Also, if there's another subreddit I can post this on please let me know, it would help to talk to people who have been in the same situation.	560	50	needadvice
Hello Reddit!\nI'm making this post to try and make sense of some of the issues that are hindering me in my life right now. Hopefully you guys can help me understand what i'm doing wrong or show me a different perspective.\nMy friend pointed out that i'm not happy, something i failed to notice by being too much inside my own head. \n It's not like i'm sad all the time, but i'm generally not pleased with the direction my life is taking. I say direction but i'm basically stuck in a rot. For more than three months i have been jobless and not really doing anything actively on a day to day basis. The highlight of my day is working out and the occasional party. \n I feel like i'm lacking in both my social life and in reaching my goals. I have a hard time making a move because there's so many things i would like to do but making a move means i'll have to let go of other potential paths i could take. \n This post is so full of crap, god. \n So i'm a 20 year old guy, i live in a shared flat outside a small city in northern Europe. Most of my friends have moved far away, we went separate paths after graduating high school. I spend six months backpacking across Australia and Asia. \n During this time i grew a lot as a person and did things that i normally wouldn't have. I was unsure of what to do with my life and i knew i liked traveling. I thought that it would give me some kind of insight and time to figure myself out, grow as a person yadda yadda. \n When i came home i almost instantly reverted into the socially anxious person who spends most of his time on the internet and inside his own head. Now i'm stuck in the same place and i want out.\nI think i'm afraid of making a choice to actively pursue something.\nIronically the solution to my problems is to do exactly that, make a move and get the ball rolling. After that things tend to work themselves out as you go along. Stagnation is death and i'm slowly rotting away here. \n I want to move abroad and start over but i'm not sure where, or what i want to do.\nI could start university or i could travel and work abroad for a while. If i had to choose a career path right now it would be acting, film or art related. All very unstable careers and only one which i have any experience to speak of, art. I don't want to end up with a lot of debt and a dead end degree. \n Thank you if you read this far! :)	Need to make a change, afraid to do so. Halp!	467	10	needadvice
My father was recently diagnosed with Cirrhosis, which is advanced Liver Disease. \n He's a stubborn bastard at 49 years old. He was forced to go the hospital last week because his abdomen was distended, and he ended up having 3 liters of fluid drained from him. They wanted to keep him for the next couple of days to run tests and monitor his health, but he insisted on going home. \n Now, it seems that even though he isn't drinking (as far as we know), his ammonia levels are through the roof, which is making him pretty crazy-- it's like it's pickling his brain. We finally got him to go to the hospital again last night, and they admitted him, but now today he is demanding to be sent home, even though his condition has not improved one bit. We tried to Baker Act him but that didn't work because legally he is 'in his right mind' (but medically he really is not). We tried to make him stay by pleading with him, but apparently, he is legally able to leave, and there is nothing we can do about it. \n I'm at my wit's end, and I don't even really know what I'm asking other than: 1.) Does anyone have any experience with this that can lend some advice? and 2.) Is there a legal loophole that we can use to have him admitted to the hospital? (My brother's idea was to video tape him saying that he is okay with dying. Would that be enough to have him Baker Acted?) \n He's not in his right mind, and he will die soon without treatment of the ammonia levels (which is what's making him paranoid and crazy in the first place). \n Any help, thoughts, suggestions or anything else would be appreciated. For legal reasons, we are in Seminole County, FL, in the United States. \n (Also, forgive me if this is incoherent. They're discharging him now, and I am typing at the speed of thought.)	My Dad has Cirrhosis and I don't want him to die. Any tips?	332	13	needadvice
"Recently I've been finding myself more and more disenchanted by the current group of friends that I have. \nThere are 6 of us (including myself) and we pretty much see each other constantly. We've been friends since first-year college (third year currently). They're my only real friends that I keep, and we haven't had any real issues since then. \n But lately I've noticed some things about them that I suppose I never picked up on before: \n \n They're selfish. For example, I'm often the one that has to drive them around everywhere, despite living a fair distance away from the general area in which they live (I even offer to do so on most occasions), yet they will argue that I should drive them to the nearest fast food joint even when there are other drivers there. (their excuse is that they want to smoke weed, and seeing as I don't, I should ""take one for the team"") \n \n They don't really ask about me or my life. I'm generally very considerate to them, I always make a point of asking them what's been going on, and following up on things they've mentioned to me recently (job interviews, meetings, etc), and I've noticed that they  never  ask me about my life or what's been going on with me \n \n I was recently let go at work, and it took me a year to secure another job (starting next month) and my friends often make jokes about how much of a loser I am for this, and I find that they smirk whenever I try to offer them life or career advice. I'm also not in the best shape, and they will often make jabs at my weight, despite the current initiative I've taken to try and fix it in the last few months \n \n \n So do I have a right to dislike them for this Reddit? Or am I perhaps taking things to personally? \nHow should I proceed with this? \n Cheers"	I've noticed some things with my only group of friends that make me feel shitty. Am I taking this too personally, or do I have a right to dislike them? \n * Edit:  thanks to everyone for your responses, looks like i need to get some better friends haha	327	48	needadvice
I recently started selling quite a few old text books on a half.ebay.com account that I had not used for about three years. The half account has an old checking account attached to it for direct deposits that I canceled a few years ago. When I tried added my new back account to get paid once I sold all the books it asked me for the full account number for the old account. I have tried calling the bank and looking through all my old paper work, but I am unable to obtain the account number. They list this issue on their site and say to contact them via their messaging system which I did a day ago, still no response. I have been googling this issues and found several forums discussing the same issue, but none that seem to have been able to resolve it or get an answer from half.

"At the end of October, my father (on the East Coast) decided to plan to visit my sister and I. She lives in Phoenix, and I live in Los Angeles. The original plan was to come on Thanksgiving weekend, but I told him that tickets would be expensive. He agreed, so he pushed it back to the first week of December. \n Through-out the entire month of November, I kept waiting for any information on this trip. I called my sister twice for new information, which she didn't have. All we knew is that my dad was flying into Phoenix, was gonna side trip to LA, then go back to Phoenix then back home. He planned to fly to LA on Dec 4, return on the 7th. I found him a cheap flight to LA. On Friday - Dec 1st - my dad and I spoke and he didn't buy the plane ticket to LA and it was now $300 and I had to find a solution. I told him there wasn't one. He'd have to rent a car and take on the expense of driving for 12 hours round trip or take the bus. I told him it was gonna be expensive, plus the hotel and eating out, and I understood if he didn't wanna come. I told him he had 48 hours to figure this out and get back to me. \n The 48 hours came and went. Now, I should mention I've told him multiple times how it was stressing me out how I was unable to plan anything, waiting on him. I didn't know where he was staying, when he was coming or going, or even what he wanted to do. I had to put in my time off request two weeks in advance, which I missed, and had to beg to get time off this week - and it was granted. \n Today, I told him I was frustrated with his inability to plan and that I didn't want him to come. I found a gig to replace the money I was losing by getting off days. He texted me: ""I'm coming. Regardless."" I told him I was going to be busy and he asked for the address of my client so he could come over and pester me! I wrote him a polite text and told him I was super irritated by his flippant attitude and lack of planning, and I wouldn't receive him. Saying ""I'm your dad"" isn't gonna cut it. \n He just wrote back, ""Lighten up and don't be so cranky. I made a great effort and expense just to come to see you so just put up with it."""	My dad was supposed to come visit, sucked at planning, stressed me out. I said not to come. He dismissed my concerns. I'm angry, and I don't want to see him. He doesn't get it. He won't apologize or try to understand why I'm mad. How can I get him to just screw off and not drive the six hours to LA without resulting in profanity?	445	66	needadvice
"I don't know why, but it seems lately i've been steadily slipping down a slope of failure and self-pity.  And that slope is a slippy one. Coming from a full family of 5, and being the oldest at 16, i've never really had a problem with grades in school or my self-esteem, but as a Junior now, i don't know, i just feel like a failure. \n I've never ever had a problem with making high b's and a's in school.  Up until my Junior year (2013-2014).  I now have 2 c's, and i feel like a complete failure, because i have fallen short of the National Honor Society for the 3rd year in a row, and now probably won't get my 3rd pin for 3 consecutive Academic Banquet participation. My parents have always been concerned for me and my grades, but now it seems like they just never have words of encouragement, just ""bring those grades up or you're grounded"".  Truth is, i've never had to study for any class in my life, it's all just come so natural, but now in Trig, Honors English, and Chem II, i'm falling apart.  I also now lack the ability to read effectively, reading an entire page and realizing i got nothing from it. \n I've always been sort of a social outcast, just minding my own business and not getting involved with parties and the like.  I just stay home and play games on my PC or PS3 on Friday nights, cause usually i never get invited to go anywhere.  I do have a girlfriend, but i'm convinced she's only with me for sexual reasons, which i wouldn't really have a problem with if i wasn't in such a bad emotional state. \n I just feel like such a failure to my parents and i have no idea how to shake the feeling and move on, i'm just moping around feeling sorry for myself and calling myself stupid because i didn't pass that trig test that everyone else made a's on for the 5th time in a row. \n I need advice on how to get past all this"	Grades slipping, bad social life, feel like a failure, can't shake the feeling of being a failure to parents and people around me	354	23	needadvice
I'm 19 and I've been dependent on my dad to sort out all my insurance and legal documentation for college.

So, I will try to keep this short....My SO and I live in somewhat of a bad neighborhood, but can't afford to move. A lot of drugs, I know for a fact we have a crack house right across the street. (Cops keep raiding it, but those damn crackheads are like roaches). Despite everything, we've been left alone....until two nights ago. \nMy SO woke up to go to work, and his truck had been broken into. A big generator and an extension ladder had been stolen, which in itself is bad enough. (Yes, we filled out a report.) Fast forward to last night and my SO wakes up to noises outside our window. He goes outside and two mother fucking crackheads are by the side of the house trying to break in the window, and they run off when they see him. \n The cops tell us to move, but its not that easy for us...besides, I think it's bullshit that the good people are the ones who have to leave and give in. What can I do, Reddit? My SO works out of town a lot, and I don't feel safe. I do have dogs, and they bark, but I'm not entirely sure they would actually do anything. All of my solutions involve violence and Molotov cocktails, but jail doesn't sound too appealing. Do you guys have any suggestions? \n I'm new at this, sorry for any mistakes. :)	I live in a crappy neighbourhood, can't afford to move and am now being harassed by crackheads while cops do nothing.

"I started a new job almost a year ago.  It was a bit of a career change for me. (relevant skills, but different industry). I knew going in, that I would be moderately underemployed, and moderately underpaid.  Since starting, I've learned that I'm drastically underemployed, and based on company grape-vine, I'm drastically underpaid.  (I was paid about 20%/yr, more, at a job I left in 2011) \n I feel like my employer is taking advantage of me.  I feel like they kindof lied to me about the job description (but not enough to raise hell without sounding petty).  I feel like I lied to myself about the upside associated with the potential for future raises. \n I'm married.  Financially, ""okay"". \n Spouse wants to leave her job.  We live 4h apart.  Yup - different cities.  It sucks.  We only see each other on weekends.  Each with low probability of finding work in the ""other one's"" town. \n Despite all of the above, I LOVE what I do.  It's embarrassing for me, whenever I talk to any of my peers from university.  They are virtually all ""doing better"" than me at this stage.  I feel like if I was paid more, I wouldn't need to feel embarrassed.  But, it really, really gets to me.  My spouse has the opposite problem.  Hates the work, but makes good dough.  Spouse has decent tenure. \n So, the fork. \n Either I quit.  Or, my wife quits.  Or, we both quit.  Or, I suppose one option is neither of us quit.  Who ever quits - moves? \n I need advice about what I can do in my spare time to distinguish myself in a job search - if it comes to that. \n Here's the thing, given my situation, I have time for a spare project.  I want to bite into one that will give me an edge in the labour market in 6 to 9 months. \n These are the options I can think of: \n \n Write a book, relevant to my skills. [have some ideas, moderately cheesy.] \n A random online project relevant to my career. [creativity needed here.  Also, high-risk/reward.  Could be seen as conflict to my day job.] \n Contribute to an Open Source software project [how do I pick which one?] \n Start a blog. [tons of hard work, is it even worth it?] \n Side-projects at work, in hopes of impressing the higher ups.

So this all starts like last week, it was me my girlfriend and her older brother. Her brother is driving us to the park to have a picnic, he's driving his dads rental car and as we were driving cyclists were in the center of the road and we had to swerve to not hit them. When we did the car spun out of control hit a ditch and flipped 3 times. We landed upside up and I was bleeding from the head. I had hit it on bent metal and it had cut my forehead open. Luckily I was the only one hurt. The bikers never stopped and we were left with no one responsible for the wreck other than her brother. After being rushed to a hospital and patched up I'm told I have a concussion and what not. I have to return to a clinic later this week and have not been given any meds for the migraines and head pain. I'm not ensured and my parents have been given these bills. My girlfriends family is being charged for the the rental car being completely totaled and in more trouble because it was the fathers rental car. My parents are planning on suing them to pay for my bills. I find it appropriate to mention that my girlfriend has chrons disease and is in pretty extreme condition, constantly having to go to the hospital and financially crippling her family. I don't want my parents to sue hers because they are not doing well either so I have no idea what to do and I'm stressed because it's a miracle that she's covered through what she's going through and I am completely lost in this! Does anybody have any advice on how I can make things less hellish?!? (	Got in car wreck with girlfriend and family plans to sue girlfriends family	301	13	needadvice
Sorry for the wall of text in advance. Earlier this week, I was offered my FIRST veterinary assistant/technician job, needless to say I was extremely excited. Today, I found out that I got accepted to the Disney Professional Interns Program, where I would work in the Animal Kingdom Vet Hospital. Both are paid opportunities, but I'm not at liberty to discuss that. Now I'm conflicted. I did commit to start working at the clinic on Monday, because I seriously thought there was no way in hell I would get Disney. I applied for Disney much much earlier. I am both so shocked and so humbled that I would be chosen for not just one but both opportunities. \n A little bit of background about me: \n \n I just graduated from undergrad in May. \n I have two wildlife internships under my belt (one birds/small mammals and one             marine mammals) \n I was an intern at a companion medicine clinic 4 years ago - did all the vet assistant things with none of the pay. \n I'm (hopefully) going to vet school next fall.  \n \n The vet clinic offers (Domestic animals): \n \n Long term job stability \n Long term working relationship with a great team of veterinarians and technicians. I seriously meant it when I told them I was not just looking for a temporary job and wanted a long term relationship. \n If I do well, I will virtually be guaranteed a summer job there during breaks from vet school \n Lots to learn and quality mentoring. They're willing to provide me full training so that I can learn everything a technician can do. \n The owner was just like me when he was 15, so I feel like he understands me and what I'm going through. \n The facility is nothing short of amazing. It's a full doggy/kitty day care and hospital. Everything is so fancy and efficient!   \n \n Disney (Wildlife): \n \n Six-month internship (beginning of January - beginning of June). This is my last opportunity to do this internship because it must be completed within a year of graduation. \n Relocate to Florida \n Hands-on veterinary care with wildlife, and I have plenty of wildlife experience but never really had the chance to see much of actual veterinary care. \n I was chosen as one of two veterinary interns at the hospital out of probably hundreds of applicants, so it is seriously an honor. \n It's Disney. I think that deserves its own bullet. \n Description of the internship: These interns function in two roles: one is as the Primary Wildlife Case Contact and the other is as an\nassistant to the Veterinary Technicians. When functioning as the Primary Wildlife Case Contact, the intern is responsible for receiving all wildlife cases that come to the veterinary hospital from the Walt Disney World\xae Resort property. This includes assessment, triage, giving necessary care as directed by the animal care staff and veterinarians, animal transport to rehabilitation facilities, maintenance of all records and databases. When functioning as Assistant to the Veterinary Technicians, the intern provides support to the Veterinary Technicians. This includes setting up supplies/equipment prior to procedures, maintenance of stock/supplies in the veterinary hospital and at satellite facilities, clean-up after procedures, cleaning/packing/sterilizing instruments and assistance with sample preparation and related laboratory paperwork. The interns are also responsible for guest interaction and giving presentations in the on-show veterinary treatment window. \n Variety of park related perks	I was offered two great opportunities, and I'm having difficulty deciding what I want to do.

Hi guys. So I never really knew what I wanted to be when I grew up and now, somehow, I am a grown up and still haven't decided. When I was younger I went through the usual stages of wanting to be anything and everything cool (an author, an actor, famous rock god) but I never actually set my mind on something and went for it. After finishing school I went off to university to study sport. I think I did this because I love sport but also to give myself three more years to try and decide. Typically, I have not managed to find a sport related job since graduating nearly two years ago, because it is a difficult sector to break into and my grades didn't set the world on fire. Now I have dabbled in several other jobs since then (I never want to work in retail ever again!) and hated basically all of them. However, since turning 17 I have worked regularly with my uncle as a painter and decorator. I love doing this, but I can only work with him when he has the work available and I'm not qualified so I can't really get a job doing this with anyone else. I have said for a long time that I think getting a trade would be the best thing for me because I enjoy working with my hands and in that type of environment. That easier said than done, of course, as the usual way into such a career is via an apprenticeship. Now I have applied for many apprenticeships in carpentry etc., but due to my age (23) and the fact that I already have a degree, no one is willing to take me on. I know I could just be patient, keep applying and hope for the best, but I can't. I was recently dumped by my long term girlfriend and I know that I need to use this heartbreak to change all those bad habits I have developed over the past few years, the main one being my constant indecisiveness. I can't shake the feeling that one of the reasons she left me was because she has her life pretty much planned out and due to how ambitious she is, she will achieve that, while I am just drifting along and getting nowhere closer to having a successful future. \n I feel like it is very hard for someone in my situation as there isn't anyone to really turn to and ask for advice (I did visit a careers office but their answer was to ring around local sport clothing shops and inquire and a retail role - something I have done and hated). I have always said that despite working in several jobs over the past 6 years, I want a career that I can take pride from. \n Anyway, sorry about the long rant, it has been a really tough week and just getting this one thing off my mind will be a slight help. Thanks guys	23 with no direction, plans or future. HELP!	506	8	needadvice
"My cousin has always suffered from depression because of her family and financial situation. We both were raised by my grandparents (her mom was always around though, they just lived with them for a long time) and my grandmother is a very negative person. I was very fortunate to be pushed by teachers to attend college so I was able to leave when I was 18. \n Her depression got to the point where her counselor apparently told her she should take some time off and move to a different one or be home schooled. My aunt is NOT qualified to be home school teacher, so she ""signed her up for an online program."" School here usually starts in August, but my cousin didn't even sign up until December. I don't see how she could have done an entire semester in just a few weeks. I'm also worried that if it's an online program it may not be accredited and high schools won't accept it if she decides to go back. \n There are a few things that have lead me to believe that she is lying and that my cousin has dropped out of school. \n \n I never hear my cousin talk about her home schooling.  \n My aunt refuses to tell me the name of her program. She always says she can't remember or just doesn't know.  \n My cousin's house didn't even have internet for almost a month last ""semester"" and she lives in a rural area where there are no places with wifi nearby. \n She said that she couldn't do the online program until December because the ""stuff from the teacher store was too expensive"" like the materials she needed for the online course.  \n \n I'm mostly worried because this is 1) illegal and my aunt could go to jail for truancy (my aunt also can't pay a fine) and 2) going to school is the only way for my cousin to get out of our family's poverty and be a successful person. \n I'm too afraid to bring this up to my aunt because she heavily subsidizes my rent by giving me a few hundred dollars a month and I think she would take it away if I make her angry. She's VERY touchy, which is why she tells me to back off when I ask about her homeschooling. \n What should I do? Is there anything I can do to make sure my cousin is in school or convince her to return to a public school? Or would the state have noticed by now that she isn't enrolled anywhere?

"Hi Reddit, \n I'm now studying in my 16th year of school. Sixteen years in the mill. More or less always doing what others tell me to. For a few years now I've been trough some depressed phases and I need a break. Be my own boss, do something else. \n My idea was to rent a house in some far away place and just relax. Read. Buy a motorcycle or get flying lessons. Explore the country and my tangled self. \n I have a side job at a small company and I asked if I could work remotely to finance the whole thing. Shouldn't be too difficult, the only thing it would require is internet. My bosses tought about it and their answer surprised me: \n ""Running away is a stupid idea, better do a real project and accomplish something you can be proud of. We have this product related to our core business we want to launch. We're going to start a subcompany to develop and sell it. Come along for the ride. It's going to be a lot of work but you'll be doing and learning a lot of different things. You'll take part in all the aspects of starting a business and will sort out your brain along the way."" \n Which option should I choose? \n Doing a long vacation is safe but soft. Relaxing, but maybe too much so.\nRunning head-first into economy? It's a make it or break kind of deal. May get a real boost, may go down in flames. \n I'm torn. Both things may work. Both may not.

Okay, so i went to university because i thought it was just the thing to do. I coasted through it never took it seriously, took the easy way out (i.e. whatever i got higher marks in and didn't have to work or study) which ended up being a business degree focused in accounting. \nMy last year i started maturing i guess, the blurr of my first 4 years of partying finally caught up to me. I wished i took school more seriously, got higher marks and chose a different degree. \nThere are so many routes i would have chosen if i could have my time back, i just didn't have the work ethic or drive at that time in my life to succeed. \n My question is, what is a good plan? Luckily i chose a degree that is pretty versatile/ general. You can do a lot with business and accounting is a pretty good paying profession if i continue on to get my CPA. \n Should i just go in the workforce for a few years and see what happens?

Take you're pathological lying somewhere else. my brother hates you and thinks youre a jerk, but is too nice to tell you to fuck off. Jerk."". I never spread rumors about her! Im in the 11th grade and she's in the 12th. Im really scared that they both believe this. Im close to tears. How can I even talk to them? Please believe me, Im a nice guy. I dont hurt anyone on purpose. My friend has been avoiding me since July. I just that that he was busy.\nSorry for writing so much. I can even imagine going to school now (of course I am going to school). His sister is extremely popular and she's everywhere. \n She said that I was spreading a rumor that I walked in on her while she was having sex.\nI never spread that rumor, nor did I walk in on her. My friend did and he told me about it in 7th grade. Thats why they think it was me. But she thinks I spread the rumor now. I forgot about right after my friend told me.\nI just cant bring up that topic. The fact that they think i spread the rumor makes me not able to even think of looking at them anymore. Im scared of how they'll look at me or act. Should I wait or does that not help"	Best friend and sister think that I spread a rumor about walking in on his sister having sex. I never did.

I posted the following comment elsewhere and was directed to this subreddit - can anyone help me with tips on renegotiating the terms of my relocation benefit? \n I will have to turn this job down with no help with upfront costs, would it be weird to ask to take a lower starting salary in exchange?  Or ask for a pay advance in lieu of the relo bonus?  I dont know where to start and dont want to start off on the wrong foot with missteps. \n It's seems incredibly embarrassing to call and ask for this, I dont really want to explain my crappy financial situation to my new boss. \n Details: \n Good: I was offered my dream job! \n After choosing to pursue my passion, and busting my ass doing election season work, my hard work has been recognized in the form of a good paying, full time year round job with a national organization working to advance progressive interests! At their HQ in a great city 2,000 miles away... \n Bad: I will most likely have to turn it down. \n I wasn't offered an upfront relocation bonus, I have to pay out of pocket and get reimbursed. Because the answer on the offer was postponed multiple times, my funds dwindled during the wait and I don't have the $400 it would cost me to get there. Nor do I have a place to stay. They want me to start on December 1st. \n Ugly: I have no emergency funds/way of taking out a loan to get me through the next 3 weeks. I left my abusive alcoholic husband in the spring, and his financial irresponsibility spiraled out of control. We had to declare bankruptcy a few months ago right before I filed for divorce. (I worked with a financial advisor and it was the only way to stop the bleeding and the fastest way to get untangled from my ex - even living apart any interaction has been emotionally abusive and hard on me.)

Hi, long time lurker, sometime poster here. I need advise on what to do regarding my working situation. I have been working for a private EMT company for about a year, went full time this past fall and have been working consistently for them since. \n The past couple of weeks have been hard for the company because thay have just picked up a new contract with a hospital and my shift has been deemed obsolete while the shift replacing it has me working an extra 2-4 hours and too late for me to get home, 1-3 am. \n I have put in my current availability and have went from a scheduled 40 hrs a week to one shift for 12hrs this week with no notice. I picked up an open 12 hr shift so I'll have 24hrs total but still not enough total time to keep my benefits, or pay my bills. Is this legal for him to do? \n Any advice would be greatly appreciated	I am overreacting to a normal situation... I get it now.	164	11	needadvice
Hi Reddit. \n Following situaton;\nI'm 17 m and usually pretty calm. I don't get furious easily but when i do I tend to sort of 'black out' and basically start behaving like a idiot. I do have a history of 'black outs', most of them in primary school. Sort of had a anger problem back then. Pretty much the same setup as now (see below) \n I don't want to hurt anybody, even if they provoke me, but sometimes the only thing left to do is to just punch the living shit out of them. \n So, two of my classmates at school seem to have a lot of fun provoking me into shouting at them. (Don't get me wrong, i do give my best to just ignore it and deal with my own stuff, but sometimes enough is enough). \nI really hope to either find a way to solve this situation, or a legitimate way to beat them up. Both are a bit shorter then me and I could beat both up simultaniously with easy, but I don't want to deal with the aftermath, because I'm still in school and would probably get into trouble for nothing. \n So Reddit, please show me a way to either calm down in seconds or a legitimate way to beat them up without getting into trouble. (Or anything better) \n If you have any questions, feel free to ask. \n (English isn't my mother tongue, so please be kind grammar Wehrmacht)	Show me a way to either beat somebody up without consequences or keep calm when provoked. \n Thanks a lot.	244	19	needadvice

I'm 21 in college and I have absolutely no will to get a degree. I was sort of put on the college path by growing up in a middle class white area where everyone gets sent off to college (there's a whole pride/shame thing about who goes where). It seems most successful students around me have actual interest in what they study. They aren't here as a chore to get a diploma for an unknown reason, like me. \n So basically I can't fake my way through college with no will or motivation to do the work. I have a terrible work ethic/set of willpower glands and unless I'm truly interested in something I can't bother with it. Maybe I have horrible ADD or something but when I'm actually interested in something I can't get enough of it. I play a few instruments (self taught) to I think a decent skill level and am a competent drawer. \n Perfect example of what happens to my interests. I really like history and when I'm spurred will heavily research certain topics that I just happen to be curious about. If I take a class about early America well, I'm not always interested in early America and when I'm not interested in something I'm incapable of being productive about it. \n So to wrap up the question, I have no idea how I'm going to get through college (if at all) and if I am going to drop out, what the hell am I supposed to do? I play music and video games and draw... I'd really like to do one of those fantasy move out to cali and live on a farm kind of gigs but I'm trying to be realistic about what I'm supposed to do for the rest of my life...(not trying to work at Burger King, no offense) \n This is sort of an existential crisis for me that I'm going to have to sort out but I'd like to hear what anyone thinks. \n I think I'm going to try WWOOF this summer or asap to really get out in the country and just live for at least a little bit	No interest in college, no marketable passions, what do I do?	358	11	needadvice
Hi friends, \n I'm a 25 year old student in Melbourne, Australia studying computer science. I've not had the opportunity to do much travel in my life so far but I decided to book a holiday with some friends to America for EDC in Las Vegas and then continue travelling around the US for until mid July. \n Going off the previous years examination schedule I thought I'd be pretty safe with the date that I chose to book my departing flights. I was wrong. 3 of my 4 exams are after the depart date. My flights and accommodation are all paid for (about $7000 so far). \n My school has some conditions for allowing examination re-sits such as unexpected circumstances outside your control, and which you know well in advance, such as unavoidable family, work, cultural, religious or elite sporting commitments. If I wish to apply to resit my exams when I get back then I need to provide formal documentation to evidence why you are applying for special consideration, for example a reason for your trip (with supporting documentation) and a complete travel itinerary. \n I don't think my application will be approved if I tell them I'm flying to the US to party. What kind of excuse could I use that wouldn't be able to be backtracked? \n <3	I booked & paid for flights and accom for a holiday \n \n 3 of my 4 exams are after that date \n \n I need a really good excuse	217	26	needadvice
Hey, guys. \n First off, an introduction would be nice, I guess! \n I'm a college student. My boyfriend lives about an hour away with his dad and goes to another university nearby. \n We met on Tinder in August and have been dating since then. I recently found out that his dad has cancer so that's why he lives with his dad; so that he can support him during his dad's treatments. \n I've never experienced a loss in my family before so I feel very awkward when talking to my boyfriend about his dad and how treatment is going. \n So, I'm wondering if anyone could give me some advice so that I can better comfort my boyfriend during this extremely difficult time in his and his dad's life? \n (Sorry for any formatting problems as I am on my phone!)

Hi all, \n Basically after leaving school I moved to a new friend group that had more relevant interests etc, after a while these friend started turing to dangerous past times e.g. Drugs, illegal street racing etc so I decided to up and leave them as I did not want to get involved with all that stuff. \n This has now left me with the problem of having no real friends that I can spend time with. I have 1 'close' friend but he has a girlfriend and also part of this old group. \n My question is: How does someone who has left school find other people to become friends with?

"If it's relevant (probably isn't), I'm a 25-year old male living in the southeastern United States. \n I have ADD and a pretty terrible short-term memory.  This has caused problems at every job I've ever had... the feedback from my bosses has been almost identical from one job to the next.  Basically it's ""You work really hard, but why the fuck do I have to tell you something 6 times?  Why can't you just pay attention and remember things?""  I recently got a script for Adderall and it's made a HUGE difference, but I still struggle with handling all the details that get thrown at me.  I put in a lot of effort with things like making lists, writing down everything, repeating things back to people so that it sticks in my mind, etc. \n I'm also INCREDIBLY bad at math.  Bad, as in my mental math skills are at a 2nd grade level.  This seems to throw people because my reading/writing skills have always been way above level, I have a bachelor's degree, I'm great at drafting and mechanical skills, etc etc, but I can't do basic arithmetic other than what I memorized in elementary school (single-digit addition, basic times tables... but just the ones that rhyme).  For example, 124 + 47 is completely out of the question without a pencil and paper. \n So, between the two of these things I get made fun of pretty frequently at work, mostly by managers.  I don't think that people realize how much I struggle with it... I always get comments like ""oh you must have drank too much last night hurr hurr hurr""  Every time I start a new job, it all goes well for a few weeks and then I know it's just a matter of time before the same comments start rolling in.  I try to shrug it off, but it really cuts me when people say shit like this.  My current job is at a small company (there's no HR dept) and just the idea of pulling someone aside and telling them that I have learning/attention problems is terrifying.  I'm fairly sure the response would either be ""suck it up and quit crying"" or ""clearly you're lying, because you went to college therefore you're smart.""  asdf;lkj;l;df"	I forget things easily and suck at math.  My managers are douchebags and I'm tired of being made to feel like an idiot.

I'm a second semester freshman at a medium size university. I'm about halfway through the semester at this point so dropping classes is out of the question. Recently I've changed directions from being a Information Technology major (CS) to looking at majoring in Journalism (with an yet-to-be-determined dual major or minor). \n The problem is now that I know I'm not going into CS/IT I'm struggling in my classes. I petitioned to drop my programming course because on top of not being interested I was struggling pretty hard to keep up and it was taking up way too much time (away from my other courses).

My grades increased significantly since transferring and I managed to get a job on campus as a lab technician. \n This lab technician job is both an advantage and problematic. It is an advantage because I am gaining valuable work experience for a job that I like to do. It is problematic because I feel that my boss is forcing me to apply for co-op through the college and not giving me an option to work strictly part time during my time in college. This ultimately causing me to take another year in college, as well as taking a semester away from school due to scheduling conflicts during my 2nd year and most importantly delaying my true goal of attaining my BSc. in physics and go into teaching. \n (	I'm unsure if I should confront my boss and discuss the issue of working strictly part time with him (and potentially losing this position) so that I can pursue teaching or bite the bullet and extend my time in college from 2 years to 3 years, apply for co-op and hold off on teaching. \n Thanks for the advice	168	58	needadvice
"Hey everyone, it's late and I've been dying to ask this of someone, so perhaps someone here has some advice - I could really use it right now. \n I'll start by saying that I'm not having an existential crisis, I just need some direction. My life as I know it has always been ""all over the place"". What I mean by that is that I've never really known (1) What I'm really good at. (2) What I should do with my life (when I was younger I pretty much changed 'what I wanted to be when I grew up' every day; although I will admit to knowing that it's not about ""knowing"" or ""growing up"" or even career-choice per se"". Suffice it to say I am now 21, I like art, but not passionate enough to pursue it as a vocation. I'm slightly interested in linguistics. I'm currently taking a course in Sanskrit (although I could not give you a solid answer as to ""WHY""; I'm pretty much taking it because it has aesthetic merit, has a huge linguistic history etc) - the important part is I don't really know what comes after all of this... I feel like I'm just floundering. I'm in my 3rd year of university. My major is Art and I am currently double minoring in English Lit and Philosophy.  I'd really like to know what use the things I'm interested in/currently doing really is. Am I just collecting ""stuff"" I'm into and I'm just not seeing the larger picture? Any advice is appreciated.

"So it's election day, and I'm a young college student of age to vote. The reason that I'm choosing not to vote is because I don't feel that I've done enough research on the candidates to be confident that I'm making the best choice, a choice that aligns with my morals and beliefs. Politics are hard to follow, especially when I feel so busy with school and other things going on in my life, but also, let's face it - it's boring. It's convoluted. It's easy to get overwhelmed. I'm sure most people have heard of the recent discussion on Fox News where the reporter discouraged young women from voting and exercising civic duties because they ""don't get it."" (Obviously if this is true, among young women and the younger generation as a whole, we should be encouraging them to get involved and educating them on how to, not discouraging them, but that's a separate discussion). The problem is, I feel like one of those young women. There's a lot that I don't get, and I want to, but I have no idea where to start. So my main question is:"	How do I begin getting involved and properly informed about US/Global affairs? \n Also, if you have a suggestion for a better subreddit to post this in, do tell.

My only sibling has told me to stay out of his life for something my friend said about his wife. Wow that kinda rhymed! We used to be really close. \n A few months back, my good friend and part-time turd wrote my brother an email telling him that his wife is a self-serving manipulative psycho. Without going too much into it, my friend had some valid points, but I felt that it was pretty uncalled for to just put it out there like that. So my brother decided to go ahead and show her the email and cause some big drama. He called me up all pissed off claiming it was all my fault because I told my friend some information about his wife (still not sure what information he was referring to) that she in turn used as cannon fodder in the email. I tried apologizing for her actions and for whatever I did wrong, but he wouldn't hear it. He just wants nothing to do with me. \n Fast-forward a couple weeks, I get some really messed up texts from an anonymous google voice account (with a little investigation, found out it was from her) saying I was abusive to my daughter and some other really horrible things. She also decided to go ahead and use that same anonymous account to message my friends and tried to stir up more crap by saying that I was cheating on my husband with my friend's fiance. None of it was true, and nobody bought it, thank FSM!\nAnyway, sense I can't exactly prove it was her, I decided to drop it. \n So now I have to look forward to the holidays, where no doubt my mom will want us to both be in the same room (awkward!) and share holiday joy and cinnamon bears and crap. I am kinda not sure how to go about this. Should I try talking to him? I am not sure what I could possibly say to him, but I would really like to make amends if only for my mom's sake. She is really torn up about this. \n A side-note about his wife: she has been known to be violent with other people as well as herself, has been admitted into mental hospitals, and I am sincerely afraid of her.  edit: I got curious, snooped a bit more and proved for sure it was SIL last night. Actually, it was under my brother's username	My brother and his wife hate me for something my friend said, and I am afraid going home for the holidays is going to be awkward at the very least.	409	30	needadvice
Hey Reddit, just getting rid of some excess stress. Advice is welcome. \n I've been afraid of my dad for most of my life. Why? Because he loses his temper easily. We just never know what could set him off or you could describe it as walking on thin ice; you just don't want to be the one to set off the chain. I don't think he'd ever get violent, though. \n He was a lot worse when my brother and I were young but even so, he hasn't improved enough to relieve any stress at home. (Example from Childhood: I remember drawing him a picture of all of us outside our house with a big smiling sun in the background. He was furious because I had used his hi-lighters and wrecked them.) \n There is history of depression in my family (my brother, mother, possibly aunt and possibly myself) and the constant emotional stress my dad causes just makes it worse. He's constantly yelling at my brother and basically calling him a failure since he's 18 and hasn't passed high school or gotten a job. I feel so bad for brother since it seems most of his failure comes from personality traits learned from my family. \n And my poor mother. She's been under my dad's thumb longer than any of us. To sum up her emotional stress? She's overdosed on sleeping pills 2 or 3 times. She's been a lot happier, though, since my aunt moved in and she got a job but, of course, my dad finds something to be angry about. She works at a dollar store and works long hours so she isn't home a lot. My dad doesn't like this. He says she isn't home enough, that she leaves without telling anyone (he usually then rants about how she's being a horrible person during these events) and the house is dirty. \n What infuriates me the most? He's the one who told her to get the job in the first place! Ugh! I'm just tired of his whining about how hard his life is. My mom worked three jobs while he sat at a desk all day. She'd come home burnt out but he would NOT let her quit her second job. (With all of us behind her, we got her to quit her second job. She quit her third on her own :) ) \n Religion has thankfully blown over in my home. My family is Mormon and I'm (secretly!) an atheist who hasn't gone to church in a few years. It used to be a huge issue, my parents resorting to threats (taking my computer away), bribes (Seriously made me wtf), and guilt-trips. I still remember them telling me that (at the time) at my age I can't make decisions like that. Wtf? \n Besides all of this, I feel pretty stable, though I do have things to work on. My social anxiety is minor, in my eyes, and I work on it everyday, I do have some problems with laziness and obsessive picking (probable stress reliever/mental defense) which I could use some advice on. I enjoy psychology, ancient history, ancient religions and photography. I plan on getting away from my family for a while and possibly moving to Winipeg for an emotional breather. \n Huge	My dad's a raging asshole that emotionally stresses my family out and I'm looking for advice on not only standing up to him, but on my laziness and obsessive picking problem as well. \n Dah-yum, did you read all that?	546	39	needadvice
Hey all, I need a bit of advice. My mother-in-law is about to pass away from breast cancer (Doctors give her less than a month, after a 16 year battle) and leave my wife and I quite a bit of money. Problem is, she has a fresh mortgage on her house and owes quite a bit more on it then she is passing on to us. I'd say she owes about 50k more on the house than she's giving to us. My wife and her sisters do not want to keep the house permanently, but won't want to immediately give it up. Plus, it will take a few months to get all the stuff out of it.  I've talked to a number of different people, but I'm not sure who the 'Professionals' (ie. lawyer, accountant, etc) are in this situation and what my options are. So far, here is what I've been told: \n \n I Can refinance the house in our name and pay on it, then try to sell it.  \n I Can 'give' the house back to the mortgage holder, and let them sort it out.  \n I Can pay on the house in the mothers name until we are done with it and then let it go to foreclosure. \n I Can pay on the house in the mothers name and try to sell it whenever.  \n \n My wife is going to be given the house in the will, but is not on the mortgage currently. \n Help me obi-reddit-kenobi, you are my only hope! \n Many Thanks, Sawser\n>	Mom is dying and owes 50k more on the house than life insurance will cover	256	15	needadvice

"Hey guys this is my first post here, First off my name is Mike i'm 18 and I really need help with my mom. So here goes... \n A couple months ago my buddy, Vincent, came back from LA to go to school with all his friends. There's Me, Mike, and my 3 other friends, Andy, Raphael, and Joe. Well Vincent began school in January along with Andy, Rapael and Joe. I didn't make it into school because 1. They made a mistake and I wouldn't have been able to get the classes that I actually needed and 2. The only day I was able to go and fix the mistake, I couldn't because my mom wouldn't let me go, she ""needed to help her with kids she takes care of"". \n In February Vincent had some family problems occur, he had an emotional breakdown and decided that he doesn't want to stay in our hometown anymore. This town is a really shitty town to live in, it's dead, nothing ever happens, the people are scumbags and never want to do anything exciting. \n Well Vincent was originally going to leave on March 9th, but after talking to one of his other friends she convinced him to stay just a little while longer, so he's now leaving in April. Andy told Vincent that he wants to move in with him in LA. I told Andy, but not Vincent, that I would like to go move in with them in LA. Reasons being my town is dull and dead it often depresses me since I do nothing but stay home and sleep all day. Nothing gives me energy to go do something, I had this conversation with my cousin Ricky a year ago and he told me ""It's your town, it's not good for you you need to get out and go somewhere else"". \n Today I asked my mom hypothetically, ""If I wanted to go to LA with Vincent, would you let me?"". She immediately answered ""No, I need you here with me, you do alot of things we can't do without you"" In reality I literally do nothing. My mom takes care of kids and drives other kids to and from school, she needs me to watch the kids that are at my house while she gets the ones at their schools. Even when I tell her to give me my money for the week she tells me ""Why do I have to give you money?!?! you don't do anything but sleep all day!"" but now she's telling me I do things! I want to move to LA with Vincent and Andy to experience something new, have a reason to find a first job (my dad wouldn't let me get one when he was in town), or just get away from my family for a while to have breathing room. \n No matter how much she pisses me off, I respect and cherish my mom to death, but I fear that she is the reason i'm stuck in the rut that i'm currently in.

So I, along with 3 others, rent out a house with a lawn. Here is the situation; Back when we moved into this house, we had a lawn with decently kept grass. The landlord would have a person come over weekly that would mow the lawn, pick weeds, trim plants etc. Last summer, we had a pretty rough heat wave. On top of that we had the city send out letters to every house saying if we watered our lawn and were caught, we would be fined $500 every time. Unfortunately, the lawn died over about four months of us sneaking in watering the lawn late late at night so we weren't caught. So now that we had a decent winter with plenty of rain, the majority of the lawn has grown grass back, patchy if best. So now the landlord wants to put in a fake lawn. From what the landlord has told us, to get government help, we have to have a lawn that looks passable. He now expects us to weed, till, and completely reseed the lawn so he can tear it up and put in the fake lawn. The question I have to you, Reddit, is who is responsible for the lawn, the landlord or the renters? (us)	Who should be responsible for lawn upkeep and maintenance?

"I have always been a very non-confrontational person. I grew up rather shy. We moved a lot throughout the midwest and I was never able to form any real friendships. As I grew older, I was in the habit of being alone, so it never got better. Ive never really had any real friends. I would have temporary groups of friends, and after a while when I didn't fit in, they all kind of just faded me out of the group and the pattern continues year after year. \n When people meet me, they say I have a very genuine happiness to me. I am a bartender, and customers time and time again have told me that I ""glow"" and that my genuine smile draws people to me. I do agree, when I am around people, I feel great. Because I have no friends, being around my customers slightly fills that hole. As a decently attractive young female, I do get a good amount of attention from guys at the restaurant.. but unfortunately, this is solely based on my looks and they only want me physically, so this ends up with me feeling even more lonely too. \n This past week, another bartender had a fit and went to the back and broke some things. It was embarrassing and rude, and I had to tell my manager the next day because I was left to pick up the slack, it was unprofessional, and I was mad. He got fired for his actions. This bartender texts me yesterday and tells me I was manipulative and that I was a genuinely bad person. He tells me that I was devious and that I wishes bad on people and that I probably enjoyed to see him fired. This guy just a few months ago was the first and only friend I had in my town and I was so hurt by this. All I did was tell my manager what happened that night. \n Just a few days prior I walked out of work to overhear another girl yelling about how much she hated me and cant stand to be around me. I walked in to confront her, and she went awol about how I ""stole"" her customers from her (I served someone at the bar who she was already serving?). Mind you, I have only spoken to her maybe 3 times ever but she has always been, I hate to use this word, but jealous of me. Some guy she had a crush on rejected her because he liked me. And apparently I was new to the restaurant when I started 3 months ago, scored higher on our bartending test, and got the job she wanted for months. But like I said, I've never really even spoken to her. \n I don't understand. I go to work and I do my job. I go home and I watch some tv. I don't have any support here and I by no means have done anything to deserve the type of bullying I have dealt with recently. I have no one to comfort me or to be there for me when this stuff happens. I think that New Jersey might not be the place for me. I don't want to run away again and move like I am comfortable doing, but I think that there is just too much pain left here for me in this town. :("	Have dealt with some bullying from coworkers at my recent job.

Okay guys, I need help. And, I pre-apologize for the long explanation. \n I\u2019ve had a job since I was fifteen years old. (My mother needed help taking care of my sister and I.)  Right out of high school, I tried to take college courses full-time and work part-time in retail. My grades suffered, badly. I ended up dropping the classes halfway through the semester. My gpa as a college student is probably somewhere around a 1 or 2 something. Please note that I graduated high school with a 3.9 and did really well on my ACT. So these bad grades hurt me emotionally. It\u2019s been a while and I\u2019ve tried to brush it away. \n Then, I got a full-time job with the company I work with now. In the seven years I\u2019ve been with the company, I\u2019ve made connections, friendships, and plenty of raises. I now make 3 times the minimum wage in my state. I\u2019m not a manager or anything. Still a worker-bee. But, to make any more money, I would need a degree. \n Going for a degree worries me. My husband and I bought a house this year. We\u2019re both in our twenties. We\u2019ve got a plan to pay it off in ten years instead of thirty years. Also, I hate working an office job, anyway. So, I\u2019ve been trying to make a plan to retire in the next fifteen to twenty years. But if I went back to college, because of my low gpa, I would have to pay for classes out of pocket. This would interfere with our financial and retirement goals. \n My reasons not to go to college: \n \n I don\u2019t see the point. College would help me progress in my current job but I don\u2019t want to be here anyway. I plan to retire within the next twenty years. \n I have friends that went and they have $60K+ in debt (not including interest) and work minimum wage jobs. So, paying the debt back would take decades. \n We want to pay off our house early and enjoy not having a mortgage payment. Paying for college courses out of pocket would throw off our plans and we wouldn\u2019t be able to pay off our mortgage as soon as we would like.  \n \n My question is this: Would the time and money spent going to college pay off? (My definition of  \u201cpay off\u201d  being the ability to make more money at work, avoid and/or eliminate any student debt, and still be able to pay off the mortgage and retire within the next twenty years.)

First of all, thanks for reading this. It feels good to let it out. \n A few months ago, my wife and I got the best news of our lives. We are going to be parents! We were both elated. Of course, there are financial considerations, which are not insignificant, but both of us work (until my wife goes out on maternity leave), so we thought we would just about manage. \n Last week, my wife and I were getting ready to go out to celebrate her birthday at a restaurant out of town. 15 minutes before we were ready to leave, a guy with a fucking Porsche crashes into my wife's parked car. The damages exceed several thousand euros. \n The guy's insurance company has put the car as being a write off, as it is beyond economical repair. They are now obliged, by law, to either offer to take the car and pay the market value (appx 4,700 euros), or pay the difference between the market value and the 'wreck value', which may or may not help us to repair the car ourselves. \n The problem is, my wife's car is a Peugot 307, which was a decent family car. Repairing it is going to be difficult (and is dependant on their compensation offer) and hopefully not cost much more than what they offer us. There aren't many cars in the local market which are half as good for the market value. \n I can't take a loan because I only just got a car for myself in January on which I had to take a bank loan (my old car was over 10 years old, and was beginning to break down at least once a month). \n Given that my wife will not be working for a minimum of eight months (there's a 3.5 month maternity leave entitlement in my country), the baby on the way, and my wife and I having jobs which are not necessarily that close to each other (and ridiculously difficult to get by with one car, given that if I'm at work, she would need a way to get around to get errands and baby-related stuff done), it's been an enormous pain in the ass. \n Basically, I'm just looking for some advice. Not legal advice, since that's outside of the scope of this conversation and difficult given that no one is probably from my country (Malta). But just practical solutions to a dad-to-be who is trying to get his house ready for a baby, supporting his wife, whilst dealing with insurance companies, mechanics and ever increasing bills. \n Thanks for hearing me out, guys :)	Having our first baby, rich guy crashed into wife's car, don't know if his insurances' compensation will be enough to either buy another decent car or repair our current one.

Having a hard time pulling the trigger on spending ANY money \n I am an over analyzer first and foremost. I know that I spend far too much time thinking about things than doing things.  I am trying to change this, or at least try things differently in order to shake some things up in my life. \n I currently work as an airplane mechanic; it\u2019s an ok gig, and am debating learning to fly getting my private pilot\u2019s license.  The catch, probably about 8 grand to do it, this is 33% of my yearly salary.  The logical side of me SCREAMS this is insane there is no way this is a good idea,  the wild hair wanting change by trying new things says, what\u2019s the worst that can happen, you run out of money and have to stop?  I sit here and weigh pros and cons all day.  Sure it may be tax deductible to a point, but good god, will I be able to afford to eat? \n Then I think of what I could do with money instead.  I could buy a new electric guitar, I could save for a down payment, save for a trip, etc.  All awesome ideas, and I boil it down to what do I really want, and of course the answer is I don\u2019t know; to which I retort if you don\u2019t know you need to try things to figure it out, and the cycle repeats. \n I guess I\u2019m paralyzed by the fear of having no money, and I feel liked I've always played it safe financially as well, so part of me wants to just go for all of these things then figure it out.  Ugh	Afraid to spend money \n Thoughts?	282	5	needadvice

Costing me ~$200.\nThe NEXT day (Friday) my ""check engine light"" came on, so I went back to the mechanic since its obviously not good my light came on. They sent me away, ensuring me that it was ""minor"", and they didn't have time to look at it. The next day, now Saturday, I had plans to meet family in a nearby city, and start driving on the interstate, and once again, my car overheats; I cancel my trip and have my vehicle towed back to the mechanic. Today, they called me quoting a ~$1400 repair due to a ""blown head gasket"", AND they still can't find a leak. My question is are my mechanics just lazy? or did they figure that if they waited a few days, my car would inevitably get worse, and the cost of my repair would go up exponentially? Just need help deciding what to do/ how I can afford now $1400 for my car/ if I can get the mechanic to lower their price"	"Took car to shop, they ""couldn't find a leak""/ problem with car, got convinced to repair minor things.

So im almost 9 weeks into good workout program. It's SL 5x5 and its getting tough, my body is starting to get sore in different places and I know its just going to get worse. I'm actually getting stronger compared to all the other stuff I've done and its great. \n Ive wanted to get into jiu-jitsu for a while, I did a few months of it a couple years ago and loved it but just couldn't commit to training 3+ times a week which I think is necessary if you actually want to improve in that martial art. \n In some ways the jiu jitsu is more important to me because I strongly need something like that in my life. I've been sorta down in the dumps, kind of alienated my friends to the point of not talking to them. I stopped playing hockey because I didn't really wanna be in the dressing room with a bunch of solid dudes who are enjoying their lives and who have an easy time bullshitting with other people. \n Anyway, I got some time off at the moment and in a month or two il be back working as an electrician and I'll probably be a lot more busy and may be reluctant to start up jiu-jitsu then. \n I may get back into hockey sometime in the future, but really I've been a fan of MMA for a long time and have naturally kept up with that scene and in jiu jitsu its just me showing up and training, don't really got to fit in as much as I would in a dressing room/on a hockey team. \n Also I for sure got some anxiety and depression and there's something nice about being able to go to the morning classes to get my foot in the door. There is a class around 5pm which I could go to while I'm working but there's so many more people there and its just not the same to me. Plus I'll be drained from work since I'm not used to 8hr days at the moment. \n Some of my questions are... \n Any advice on how to make sure I don't destroy my body where I screw up some of the most important weeks of SL 5x5 and as well can't train jiu jitsu? Maybe I should take some more supplements to recover faster? \n This seems kinda like a dumb post, maybe it's my anxiety kicking in and I'm just taking forever to start jiu jitsu, I probably should have started already, however, now I'm actually a little concerned about how strenuous the SL 5x5 is getting and also starting up jiu-jitsu, I'll probably get too sore to do anything at all at some point soon	Im getting to the most strenuous part of a workout program, SL 5x5. Want to start jiu jitsu because I REALLY need something like that in my life.

"I will try to make this story as short as possible (because if I list every interaction with AT&T it's going to be a long one).  I wasn't sure if this was the right place to submit to Reddit, but hopefully one of you guys can help me! \n My husband gave my sister his old AT&T iphone 5 approximately 4-5 months ago.  Last Thursday my sister's service to her phone was turned off.  She logged on to the AT&T website, and reinstated it. This occurred 3-4 times over the course of the day before she called someone. The AT&T rep wasn't sure what was happening, but told my sister it shouldn't turn off again.  Friday, it turns off again, so she goes into the store to talk to a person and they state that someone has reported the phone as stolen and that the original owner of the phone needs to confirm it wasn't stolen.  My sister tells my husband and I what's going on, and after work on Friday my husband and I ended up calling AT&T. After waiting for over an hour for the ""fraud"" department to pick up, the rep tells me that it looks like the department is done for the week and I will get a call back first thing Monday morning.  No, no call ever came. \n This is the part where I am skipping the 3 different 1 hour phone calls my husband had with different reps over the course of Monday, and the countless calls my sister has had over Friday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  Now my mom gets involved (its a family account - even though we are all adults), and confirms with an Apple rep that it looks like the phone may be hacked (since my husband did not register it as stolen and they have NO IDEA why it's been reported as stolen since there is no record of it being reported as stolen), and the only way that AT&T will lift the lock (he three-wayed the call with my sister and AT&T) is if the original owner has the receipt showing the phone purchase. \n My husband bought the phone from an AT&T STORE shortly after the phones came out in September 2012.  He dropped his AT&T account two years ago because of this type of customer service and typical AT&T bullshit.  Every time he tries to talk to someone about his account they say he cant have access to it because it's closed. \n Does anyone know what to do at this point?  Any help would be appreciated, and no, the phone is definitely not stolen. :)"	AT&T randomly marked my sisters phone as stolen, wont turn it back on, and wont help us find a reasonable solution.	437	21	needadvice
Hey guys! I am having a bit of trouble deciding how to organize my phone. As you know, smartphones are a must-have for everyday life and with my phone and a pair of headphones, I'm ready to face the world! But alas, this comfort has its limits. I am now facing a nail-biting dilemma. I have only 2GB left in my phone. I can either remove my N64 and NDS roms with my flac radio head and beastie boys collection, or I can keep my beloved and forever nostalgic roms. I don't know what to do, both sacrifices are equally great and I simply cannot remove any of the other files I have on my phone. (Note - My phone has an internal of 64GB and external of 128GB.)

"My girlfriend was in a pretty serious car accident a few months ago. She had minor brain damage, but not a scratch on her. She made a miraculous recovery in less than a month, bypassing every doctors recovery rate by miles. She still has minor issues such as balance, and she obviously isn't cleared to drive yet. The problem is her parents constantly threaten to send her back to the rehibilitation facility she stayed at if she breaks any rules at home. She is currently 17 and turns 18 in less than a month. Her parents tell her she can't move out because of ""medical reasons"" and they will be her guardian and basically put her on medication to be more compliant. Is this legal? Is there a law that allows this?\n(Currently live in Maryland, if that helps)"	Girlfriend wrecked her car, minor brain damage, overcontrolling parents refuse to let her leave the house and overmedicate her.

I am a 21 year old male, looking for some tips on style/fashion. All my life, I've never fully understood the concept of 'style'. I saw it, my friends had it, but I could never grasp it for myself. To this day, my average outfit is usually quick and easy to throw on. For example, here's what I wore today: Green-cargo shorts, a Target brand NASA T-shirt, and a pair of cheap Chaco Sandals that I scored on sale last summer (they're starting to rip). \n You might be wondering why I don't ask a guy friend this question, but I have more than once: We'll go out 'shopping', and then it slowly drifts to what they want for themselves. I'll pick up an article of clothing that catches my eye, and they will sort of chuckle at my choice as they go to checkout (boohoo, yeah w/e). I've also asked a girl before, too, which was sort of embarrassing for me to do in person. She got really excited, she took me to the Mall, but we ended up getting pretzels and nothing got done lol. But I'm not here to bitch about my lack of knowledge and experience with style for attention. My point being is this: I don't know style, or how to dress, and have never gotten much help from friends. \n I understand there is a much more in-depth psychology to it (relating to personality, etc). But even simple stuff with like, my hair; I don't know how to maintain it in a way that looks attractive. Of course I wash my hair everyday, but do I use product? No, because last time I did I embarrassed the hell out of myself. Why not go out to Urban Outfitters and just buy what I think is attractive? Because I always end up buying something I think fits me nicely and looks good, until I hang out with my friends and realize how awkward/baggy it is compared to their clothing. It looks try hard and bad. I don't know how to match colors, either. I don't know designers, or where I would fit. I'm very basic. It sucks. So if you have any advice, that would be much appreciated. \n Thanks	I don't know how to dress	372	6	needadvice

The job is wonderful, both the boss and supervisor is great, but I'm only planning on taking it for 3 months period.

A few years back, my Grandfather and Uncle sold their business they were partners in. My Grandfather originally started the business and when he retired, made his son (my uncle) a partner in the company and left it for him to run. \n Unfortunately, my Uncle ran the business into the ground, and it was 500k in debt at the time of sale. The company had been in deficit for a few years, however, my piece of shit uncle and his wife decided to take advantage of the company and the fact that my Grandfather was personally funding the company out of his own pocket to try and keep it afloat. \n My uncle was financing his own personal items through the company unbeknownst to my Grandfather at the time. This includes his own truck, car for his wife, car for his daughter, gas cards for his family (unrelated to the business), RV, boat, atv etc. the list goes on. \n At the time of sale, the company 500k in deficit, Once the sale was settled and assets and inventory were sold, the remaining debt is 150k. \n My uncle has completely walked away and left my sick Grandfather to harbour all of the debt, which he is now paying off via line of credit from the bank. My Uncle on the other hand, is completely denying that there is debt, and that he did nothing wrong (I have seen the books). \n Not only, has my Uncle screwed over my Grandfather, he also left many suppliers with unpaid invoices that have now gone to collections. Every time one of the collectors tries to contact my uncle to get paid, he changes his phone number and gives them my Grandfathers phone number, leaving my Grandfather (who is very sick and dealing with my sick grandmother as well) to deal with collections and pay off more debt that isnt his. \n What can legally be done to either make my Uncle pay or take responsibility, or somehow make him legally responsible for all the debt. \n Edit: BTW in Canada	My uncle is a piece of shit, left grandfather with 150k in debt, what can legally be done to my Uncle	342	21	needadvice

Hi Reddit, I've only had 3 or so marijuana experiences, all peer-pressured, and it feels like these have been detrimental to my mental health. \n The first time was when I was 16 and my 'best friend' (who started hanging out with a bunch of lowlifes) pressured me into eating a weed brownie. I tripped so extremely hard and did not like it at all. I immediately ended that friendship, but for months it left me with anxiety... I had never been high before and that feeling of looping-memory and being totally unable to control my consciousness left me self-diagnosing myself (horrible thing to do) and continually questioning my mental health by trying to discern what my mind was like before I tried marijuana, and what it is like after. \n Well, that went away for a few years, and I'm now 23. A little over a month ago I was at a party and my friends girlfriend shoved a weed cookie into my mouth when we were drunk, I ate it, and again I had another bad trip. Since then, the same questions have preoccupied my mind and it's getting frustratingly annoying and causing me to become depressed. I find myself constantly questioning how I felt before I tried weed, and it causes me to overthink existence, consciousness, life, etc. I end up scaring myself by questioning whether I triggered some sort of mental illness, and this has been nothing but bad on my daily life. For instance, even when I'm having a good time with friends, it will dawn on me to question why nobody else I'm with are experiencing these negative thoughts! I have no motivation to do the things I love doing and I constantly just want to sleep. \n Overall it's a hard feeling to explain... to me it feels like the anxiety you feel when you realize what death is and how it is inevitable. I just want to shake all the bad thoughts and just live my life and I realize that this is all being fabricated in my head. Any advice on how to shake it? Seriously replies appreciated :)	hated my marijuana experiences, and overthinking about how it affects my consciousness has made me depressed.	355	16	needadvice
"Just recently came to the realization that I've been depressed for about a month now. I'm a freshman in university and I've always been a happy care-free kid but I've fallen into a terrible terrible cycle of sleeping through most classes for the past weeks and even when I force myself to get up my anxiety over the fact that I've missed so much class scares me into missing more class. \n It finally became ""real"" last night when I ran into a buddy who was complaining about an exam we had last week in a class we shared together. I had no idea what he was talking about. I actually missed an exam in that class because it was so early in the day and I didn't show up to that many classes. \n I haven't told anyone because I'm ashamed of myself for fucking up my grades as much as I have. I know that I'm failing math and I have b's and 2 d's in my other two classes. I'm terrified of failure which only makes my anxiety worse. \n I don't know what to do. I think I need time to work this out by myself but I'm also worried to tell my family that I've basically failed my first semester. I have high expectations because my brother has been in prison for the past 3 years and (part of my depression comes from finding out in the past few weeks that I won't get to see him for another 6 months even though he was supposed to come home)  in that whole situation I've played the role of the ""good little brother that has his shit sorted out"". I'm terrified my mom will compare me to my brother because (while he didn't get into uni and had go to a small community college) he also failed out after about a semester and that downward spiral was what led him to prison in the first place. \n I also think I hate my major. I love all things humanities related like English and comm but I've convinced myself that any kind of major in anything I would ""enjoy"" would never get me a job. So I came into uni as a computer science major and I've hated every minute of it but have told everyone around me I love it because I keep trying to convince myself I do. I'm my own worst enemy in that sense. \n Right now I'm lying in my dorm room bed and I really don't know what my next move is. I want to take time for myself but I also want to return to university next semester because I'm afraid if I actually ""dropped out"" I would never come back. I also don't want to have to explain to my friends I've made (and plan to live with next year) that I can't anymore because I've been depressed and failed out of school. Is my own pride what's holding me back?

"My mom is 58 and is the sole person working at her own title insurance company.    She didn't intend to do it all herself, but her business partner quit very early on and she doesn't make enough money to hire anyone else.   She is forever backed up and overworked, and incredibly stressed over the real estate legal issues that crop up.

After about 8 months of campaigning I was FINALLY able to get her to go see a doctor, but that was only a baby step, she now needs to go back for bloodwork (she very likely has a thyroid issue), then actually follow through with prescriptions, etc.   It will be very hard to even get her to go to the testing.  Simply going to the doctor was so stressful to her that she spent the rest of the day getting drunk.   It seems like she is leaving her medical issues untreated on purpose, but she is also just really bad at looking after herself to begin with. \n She's extremely stressed out and toxic to be around.   She's basically a walking meltdown.  She needs to quit her business, but she claims she ""can't"" because she wouldn't make enough money doing anything else.

I strongly believe my mother has narcissistic personality disorder.

Hey guys so I think I have food poisoning as of this Monday when it started. I think I got it from taquitos for not cooking it long enough (TIFU) . I'm currently taking 2 tylenols every 6-8 hours and getting lots of rest and a good supply of water in me. I Currently have a headache, stomach pains and diarrhea (no blood) and chills and a fever. My task right now is to try to get rid of these stomach pains in order to do that I just have to poop, however only little is producing. I've been eating healthy following BRAT and some bland oatmeal. Any suggestions/recommendations would be appreciated. Thanks	food poisoning (not extreme)	113	4	needadvice
I live on the east coast, I want to join Rotc in college and major in either criminal justice or homeland security. After the army I would love to get a job on the police force, preferably as a k-9 handler, or something similar, swat? I would like to go west, mid west is my border. I feel that the Army programs and majors would be better out there because stereotypically, the west and south is where a lot of military and police programs are boasted up. I also know someone who lives out west who I would like to be closer to. Basically, i would like to know if I wanted to go down that career path, which major would be better (or what other major would be good too) also should I be looking at schools out west rather than east	which major would be better (or what other major would be good too) for me and should I be looking at schools out west rather than east	143	27	needadvice
I basically lost 2 of my best friends in a matter of a few months. \n 1 basically randomly cut me out of her life one day back in April. Randomly. No reason given. No reason why. I've texted her probably 100 times and shes probably returned my texts twice. Some of my texts have been rather desperate too but she hasn't sent me a real text. I miss her and idk whats wrong. \n My other best friend met a guy she works with and shes changed. She's been so rude to me, she refuses to hang out me because the guy doesn't want her hanging out with other guys. The guy wants to keep their relationship a secret and shes fine with it (I'm literally the only one who knows). He's also blown up at her twice in the few weeks they've known each other and she still takes him back. Shes really conservative too, religious, and shes proud of the fact. But he has her sexting and stuff. Furthermore, he's Muslim (she's not) and them even talking is a HUGE taboo in our culture. Her dad would literally disown her. I've tried talking her out of it I've even gone as far as begging her but she won't listen to me. I'm fairly sure she's not gonna talk to me ever again over this. \n To top this all off, my grades are slipping and I've felt really depressed lately. I've had a few minor suicidal thoughts too. No idea what to do anymore and who to talk to	my one best friend cut me out of her life unexpectedly, my other best friend chose a guy shes known for less than 4 weeks over her best friend of 4 years and I'm lost about it.	259	37	needadvice
Reddit lurker for several years, first post.  You guys crack me up.  Hopefully this is the best place to put this. \n I am starting my Senior year for a BS in Software Engineering.  Ever since I started my core classes, I have been dissatisfied with the education I was getting.  Staying patient and trusting the higher-education machine, I stuck through to where I am now.  Currently I am looking for an Internship to satisfy my degree, but come up with work that is hardly relevant. \n The corny: I am so very excited to get into the software development industry.  I feel as I progress to graduation, I become less prepared for this dream.  I feel I learned so much doing this stuff on my own since 14, and this curriculum has made me rusty.  I am very humble and just wish to be given a chance at an Internship that will sharpen me up.  Even better would be an employment opportunity. \n A quick fix to satisfy my Internship is doing a couple web coding jobs for some business owners I know.  But it seems more of the same in going solo and not getting any experience in the development process.  I am humble in knowing that I have much to learn.  I am 29 years old and have made a living all across the US as a Gymnastics Coach and Sports Performance Trainer since graduating high school.  This isn't my first rodeo.  But this career switch is proving to be difficult. \n In my emotionally charged state, I have made this plan:  decide to continue with my schooling or not, and whore myself out to anyone in the United States that is willing to give me a shot as an intern (figured I'd post it on Craigslist?).  I will offer up to 30 hours a week unpaid (so I can use 10 somewhere else to pay the bills) and will be there in a few days if something blows my skirt up.  Just me and my dog. Let me get my hands dirty and I will work my ass off. \n I am a clean cut farm boy that enjoys skiing, surfing, bodybuilding, and rock n' roll.  Any advice or questions, have at it. \n Fun fact: I once took a chainsaw to the face. \n Love you guys,	in  bold	385	2	needadvice
earlier this year, my[22] younger brother[18] dropped out of college. he's been living at home/working at CVS ever since. he doesn't have any friends, and when he gets home from work he goes straight to his room and is on his computer all day. he barely talks to anyone in the family. when called to dinner, he won't even answer or eat, and will eat separately later from everyone else. \n the thing is that he used to be a normal, happy kid through middle school. then high school happened, where he didn't have a lot of friends, his confidence dropped, and his grades fell. family noticed this and tried multiple times to tell him this was a problem, which probably came across as lecturing. in doing so, and in our frustration, we yelled at him, which caused him to shut us off more and more. my dad in particular burned all bridges. we even took him to a psychiatrist a few times, but he said that it probably wasn't depression. he withdrew more and more into himself and started locking himself in his room and ignoring everyone. he did get into college, and we thought things could start new from there, but stuff happened and then he dropped out. he's been living at home for about 5 months now, and he's better now in terms of not shutting family members out than he was throughout high school, but he is still by himself a lot of the time, which is worrying, and i don't know if this can continue forever. is this a problem that needs addressing? is shutting yourself off from other people a warning sign of depression/other mental issues? as bad as this sounds, i don't want to one day find that he's shot up a school as a result of spending so much time alone	my brother spends all of his time alone and withdrawn, not sure if this is a sign of depression or something more serious. he used to not be this way, but for the past 3-4 years he's been alone and doesn't have any friends.	308	44	needadvice

"I honestly find no point in continued education. After 2 years in a university and several dropped classes and wasted money both on my end and my parents end. I find continued education something I don't need in my life. It feels like all these things I'm learning contribute nothing to my future. Who deemed we need further education for better jobs in the future in the first place? \n The things I'm contemplating (Idk if it's the right word >.>) is either \n \n Drop out \n Pursue a trade skill \n join the navy/af/marine/etc \n \n Obviously, knowing that I have dropped at least 7 classes in 2 years, dropping out is already on my list for consideration. I just don't know what to do if I drop out. Should i give education another chance? Or should I drop out and pursue something I enjoy doing? \n What do I enjoy doing? Besides the last 2 years of my life wasted in gaming, socializing with friends, and just being a lazy ass, I have nothing I enjoy doing. I do however, have a moderate knack for building legos or anything that requires the brain. Like solving puzzles, I've always had a knack for these things, but what can you apply this too in real life situations? Being a cop? Being a detective? But last I check, you need education, at least a BS degree in criminology for that. \n Pursuing a trade skill, hmm, I've always enjoyed cooking. I love to experiment and make my own food, but my parents would never approve of that. The old Chinese discipline is good grades and a great graduation. That's what they pursue in their kids, and hell, I'm all for that, but when you realize further education doesn't prove jack shit for you and benefit you in the slightest, you sort of give up hope on that too. \n Of the courses I've taken at my university, Math, English, Chemistry, Bio, Trig, and other boring general ed classes. I've learned and remember nothing. I got average grades, like ""C"" ""B"" but I never get A's. I never got A's in high school either. I graduated HS with a 2.8GPA. Hell if I know what I was heading into life with. But it's definitely not further education. \n What are my choices guys? I know it's a desperate call when you have to point to Reddit for answers to this. Why not just go talk to a counselor you say? Because the last time I tried talking to a counselor, she kicked me out of her office because I didn't ""try"" in school. Hell lady, I did, and you know what? It didn't work for me. So I can't go to a counselor, because of that incident. I know there are many people on Reddit that took many different routes in life and they are still doing fine, the question is, how did you manage? \n If you had read all of that, I deeply appreciated it, but if you haven't"	i feel further education in college is a waste of my life, drop out? pursue trade skill? join navy/af/army/marine/etc?

"My old roommate is really unstable.  He's on a daily regimen of klonopin.  He'll get a prescription for it and go through it well before the refill date.  Oh, and he drinks.  A lot.  He loves to drink.  The semester before I moved out he had to drop all of his classes and go clear his head (through more drugs and alcohol). \n He's not very intelligent and prone to violence.  While in drunken, drug-induced rages he broke a few walls, obliterated his laptop, etc.  I managed to not get into any serious altercations with him while I lived there for two years. \n About the ""rages"" I mentioned earlier:  More times than I can count on one hand, my roommate went into psychotic-type rages in the middle of the night.  These would last for hours.  One culminated in the aforementioned dropping out of school for a few weeks.  The others didn't really go anywhere because the upstairs roommate (whom we rented from) liked him, despite my objections.  These times were strange.  I've never seen someone act so strangely.  That's the easiest way to put it.  He would wake up in the middle of the night after being asleep for about an hour, and just go on godzilla-like rampages throughout the house, while I locked my door and tried to sleep because I had class in the morning. \n At one point, the upstairs roomie actually did kick him out because of this.  I was there and I recorded it on my phone.  But then, he magically didn't get kicked out.  That's life, I suppose. \n I just waited for the school year to end and finally got the fuck out of there.  Moved in with some people I actually like being around now.  It's nice.  And while I was cleaning my room, my crazy roommate was incredibly nice.  He even offered to patch up the nail holes in my walls after I had moved everything out! \n Now, after no word from him for a month, he sends me a few (3) messages: \n >I am so glad that johntdowney is out of our place... What a terrible roommate and I wouldn't suggest anyone living with that pot smokin, dirty dish leavin, bottle stealin, klonopin stealin, oxycodone girlfriend fiend stealin pieces of garabage... Downsworth I'm glad you're out and I hope you and your ugly girlfriend find a place where the drugs come cheep cause mine aren't for sale you low life piece of garabage \n He seems to think we stole his klonopin.  He's set on this, despite having no evidence (there is none). \n >Fuck you johntdowney, I hate you and your ugly ass sweatpant wearing ugly girfriend of yours.... I \n Ope, looks like he pressed send too early.  Here's the third: \n >I'm still gonna kick your ass one day for that you fucking note leavin faggot, say it to my face you fucking pussy... I fucking hate you, you pot smoking faggot.... go sit in your car some more you fucking car you friendless douche \n I'd leave him notes like, ""hey, stop using [insert various items here].  it's mine, not yours.""  That's been dwelling inside of him, apparently.  Also, for the record, I don't smoke pot ^_- \n I guess the advice I'm looking for is how to deal with this.  These messages look like he's either coming down or flying high.  The first one was a message and a public post, though.  It had one 'Like,' a distant relative through my brother's marriage.  Not sure how to take that, lol.  He's posted stupid shit about me on facebook before, but he usually deletes it the next day. \n Oh, did I mention he attacked one of my new roommates in a bar because he, too, stole his klonopin?

I'm going to be in grade 12 next year. I am under so much stress to decide what I want to do. University, community college, I just...have no idea. That combined with the fact that the economy in Alberta is absolute  shit  right now makes me ambivalent to decide on anything. \n I have posted a question on here a long time ago and got  some  advice, but I haven't settled on any programs I want to go into. I was first considering psychology for a long time, but then I found out it includes a lot of statistics and I don't have the math for that. (I actually took that level of math last semester and failed.) \n I'm wondering if there might be an in-depth online quiz or test that might help? I know it won't be completely accurate to something I might want to do but I would find it easier to get started if I had something like a test to gauge my personality and stuff. (As for Myers-Briggs, I am INFJ) \n It's also pretty hard for me to come up with my interests on the spot. The only one that has always been there with me is Japan, and learning Japanese. I'm actually in Japanese 20 right now, and loving it. My dream is to go to Japan. But I'm not sure if I would make a good English teacher, since I have high levels of anxiety. \n This is a huge wall, I'm sorry. \n I guess	can't decide on what to do for the rest of my life, would like some help?? \n xx	249	17	needadvice
Using a throwaway as some friends and co-workers know my username and I want to keep this private for the moment. \n My girlfriend (I'll call her Claire for the sake of this) told me she was pregnant a few days ago but that her nurse told her it won't go to term. She is currently on a contraceptive injection and due to this fact we don't use condoms \n Claire basically told me that she got a positive pregnancy test but that because of her contraceptive injection(she doesn't know the name of the one she is using) her nurse told her the fertilised egg won't develop. However the majority of thing I have read about the injections tell me this wouldn't be the case \n Claire said her appointment went like this: \n She goes to her nurse for the injection and as normal they ask her to take a pregnancy test before being given the injection, she does so and it comes back negative. Claire is then told that because we have had sex a few days prior to the appointment she will have to take another test in two weeks. She is then asked if she still wants the injection, she says yes. \n Fast forward two weeks and claire's second pregnancy test comes back positive, she calls her nurse who tells her 'you won't be able to have the baby'. This is where the confusion arises as Claire is under the impression that she doesn't need to do anything, that the pregnancy will just not go to term. \nMy understanding is that the injection won't stop the pregnancy (only thing I have read is that explains this is that the injection stops the egg from receiving nutrients from the uterus wall) \n She won't talk to me about is as she is 'too upset' so I'm struggling to get any information from her plus the fact the last couple of weeks things haven't been great between us \n I'm posting as I need somebody to explain this properly to me as it doesn't add up and I'm not sure if There is a child on the way or not	girlfriend has positive pregnancy test but child won't develop, won't explain the situation properly to me, leaving me stressed and not knowing if I'm going to be having a child	356	30	needadvice

I injured my knee over the summer (ruptured ACL) and am currently doing physiotherapy to see if I can get the knee stable enough to avoid surgery. In the months before the injury, I had started on a fitness regime to try to get fit and lose some weight (working out at a women's gym + some swimming, biking, running). I'm reasonably mobile again and can walk 3-4 miles in a day with a knee brace, and I'm trying to control my diet as well as possible, but my weight is starting to creep back up. My BMI is 29, and my long term goal is to get it back down below 25, which means losing ~30 lbs. For now my priorities are to stay as fit as possible, avoid getting fatter and maybe lose a modest amount of weight. Any suggestions? (obviously I'm going to speak with the physiotherapist about this next week, just wanted to see what folks here could suggest in the meantime)	ruptured ACL, BMI 29, don't want to get fatter.

"So Ill try to keep this as simple as possible. \n I have a car financed through Honda and have been paying on it for about 4 out of the 5 year term so I'm pretty much down to just finishing off the interest. \n I decided to cash out a mutual fund and use the cash to ease some monthly bill by paying down debts... also maybe buy a few toys and take a vacation but thats not really the point. \n Last few months Ive been a little slow in paying on the car so I imagine there could be some ""30 day late"" marks on my credit report. \n buyout on the car is about $7000 right now. \n So that's the background... here's the question: \n Should I \n a) put all the money to cover future payments in a new checking account and just do 2x auto pay for a few months to add some ""on time"" payments to my credit report and then pay it off in one lump sum after that's happened for a while? \n or \n b) just pay the whole thing off right now and be done with it as soon as I get the check from my banker dude? \n I dont know which would look better on the credit report, showing the ability to make payments on time after a while of being late or paying the whole thing off early. \n Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated. I have a few days before the check gets here (and my next payment is due) so I have some time to think about it. \n somebody told me to refinance it because that's another ""acceptance"" to add to the credit report but I don't wanna refinance when all I have left to pay is interest from the first loan. \n Thanks :)"	which is better for paying off a loan: string of on-time payments or lump sum early pay off?	301	18	needadvice
I have been stressing a lot over this decision for the past few months and I finally actually have to make a decision. I just cannot decide for the life of me. \nI would rather go to this school that costs 13k that is one state away from me in Wisconsin. I would rather go there because I like the feel of the school better and I like the major more at that school. Also, if I went there my girlfriend would also which would be great. \nThe other school I would commute to and would only be 2k a year because I have a ton of scholarships there. This school is actually more well-known than the other school also, which is cool. I just do not really like the school much because it's a Christian school and even though I am Christian, I don't want to take the Bible classes and I also want to have a bit more fun during college than being at a Christian school where no drinking or anything is allowed. \nI simply just do not know how worth it it is saving the 11k going to the school I wouldn't want to go to as much.. I think I would have to work while going to school whereas the cheaper school I wouldn't need to, so that sounds kind of shitty to me. Anyways, even if nobody replies to this it feels good to just write out all my thoughts. If anyone has any advice to give on how worth it is spending the extra money on a college you would prefer, I would appreciate any replies. \nEdit:	cheaper school, or one I would prefer?	274	7	needadvice
So it's my 20th birthday in two weeks but I'm too afraid to invite anyone, anywhere to celebrate/party. \n Here's the backstory, as an introvert/poor social skills, when I was still in high school I didn't have many friends maybe 3? I'm not sure if they actually were my friends since they were what triggered my depression two years later. \n Anyway I had this birthday party for my 16th and from the 40 people I invited only about 8 attended. Heartbreaking as FUCK since a lot of those people pretended to be my friends. Anyway fuck it acted like I was ok still talked to almost everyone maybe less, but still. \n At 17 I just didn't do anything was in fear that what happened last year would happen again. Also was slightly depressed because of the assholes I mentioned earlier. Fuck yeah \n Next year I make more friends, slightly more popular, met new people, slightly less depressed. What the hell I'm gonna party this year. It didn't go that bad out of around 40-50 about 16 came. Everyone had a great time but I was still disappointed so many people told me they'd come and just didn't \n First world problems lol \n Anyway this year i know way more people than I ever thought I would but I'm not sure if I should do anything, I want to but I'm afraid to. I don't know who to invite/who would come.

We are best friends since almost forever. We've been together at the primary school, high school, graduated on different universities but remained friends all along. ME 26F - HIM - 26M. \n He was always an introvert while I was an extrovert. I am the one who always makes him laugh, and try to cheer us up, and tell stupid things while he's more quiet - except when he is really excited or happy about something. but in general he is like that. \n the other thing is that he does not seem to care so much about showing affection. i mean i know he loves me (at least I knew until now because now I don't know what to think anymore), but he barely does something about reminding me about it. while i am the contrary. i do everything i can to let him know how much i love him. \n the thing that bothers me the most is that he seems to act differently around other people. i mean - it feels like he is only kind to those who don't care about him as much as i do. one example. I know facebook is not a relevant data or anything but to be honest, all of us are living virtual lives as well right? so virtual life can also say something. I can write on his wall and post photos with him and everything and he never even likes them or replies to the posts i make on his wall. and when i ask him WHY, he starts explaining how facebook is bullshit and bla blah blah. ok. i totally agree. but then why does he reply to everyone else? likes the photos of other people but not of his best friend? THIS IS RIDICULOUS and i can't believe i even brought it up. but reddit I am almost desperate. I love this guy to the moon. he is for me like the brother i never had. and i don't wanna lose him. \n but if things continue like this i may give up on him. \n the last update is that before couple of weeks we kinda made out one night. we always had this agreement saying that one day we would kiss. and yeah we kissed and fooled around a bit but that was it. no harsh feelings no nothing. we talked about it. we were both okay to leave it with that and that's it. he moved on with his gf and me with my bf and yeah. but from then on I THINK he is avoiding me. he hasn't called me in days. and i am quite sure that if i don't call him - he won't even bother to. \n i mean we have planned to have so much fun this summer and now we're barely seeing each other. why is this happening to us? what the hell is going on? why can't he just understand that i need him to act like a friend? i have tried to talk with him about it but he just doesn't want to listen. or maybe he doesn't get it. \n it can also be possible that he doesn't love me anylonger and just wants to part ways with me. \n I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK ANYMORE. I only know that I have promised myself to wait until he calls. and if he doesn't bother to call me at all, if he doesn't miss me at all - I guess I will have to give up on him. as much as it would hurt. i know it would kill me but I cannot go on like this anymore. \n redditors any advice is more than welcome. bring them on :)	my best friend of 10 years is showing no signs of being a friend. anymore. i have talked this with him but he doesn't get it. if the situation continues like this i am willing to give up on him. tell me your opinion. should i? shouldn't i?	617	48	needadvice
THis is a bit of a complicated web, so I'll try to make it simple. For a year and a half, I have been adjunct teaching art classes at my alma mader while working part time at a bookstore (which I absolutely love and am not prepared to leave). This had worked out great until low enrollment forced me to stop adjuncting at that school and take up full hours at the bookstore. I have missed out on a semester of teaching and applied for some other adjuncts around the area  with no luck, until I got offered a last minute class at a school I haven't taught at before in a subject I am not so confident in. I took the job because I was desperate for some teaching experience (especially at a new school which looks really good).  I have verbally confirmed this job but have not signed any papers yet  and have moved around my schedule at the bookstore to accommodate. Meanwhile, the pervious school needs me for TWO classes (both of which I have already taught and am extremely comfortable with) on days that I don't work at the bookstore. This would be more money, and easier on my schedule. But, IM feeling like I have an obligation to stick with the first school? Im in a position where money an experience are key, so I really don't want to screw this up with either burned bridges or not enough money to pay the bills. Technically I could teach all three classes as they do not pose a time conflict, but I am worried about how this would impact my bookstore job, which has been such a great cushion and opened up a lot of doors for me. \nWHAT DO I DO? (I kinda just wanna say screw it to the first job and take the later 2, but I know that that could look bad, and add more monotony to my resume)	have 2 job offers, took the first verbally but signed no papers, would rather take the 2nd offer as I have more experience/would earn more money/would fit better into my schedule.

hi reddit, SECOND post here (first one i posted in the wrong subreddit). i live in socal and received a speeding ticket (83mph) in april of this year. in ca you can do traffic school to hide the point on your license. i requested traffic school and due to work and school had to extend the date to 8/25/2011 (last week) those of you familiar with ca law, might know that recently the law was changed so that the dmv now reports tickets to insurance companies. i received my insurance quote today and it went up hundreds of dollars. i sent in the certificate of completion for traffic school before 8/25. my father believes that because i did not complete my traffic school before the ca law changed, that i am subject to it as well; arguing that it was still an open case until i completed traffic school. i have not been able to find any information on this new law, at least on google (my father says it was put into effect 1 month ago). my opinion is that my insurance renewal period occurred before the dmv was able to process my traffic school. please help reddit! i can't afford to pay so much for traffic school! thanks! (ps, i know that not all of you are lawyers but i would appreciate any advice/help/insight!)	need info on the new CA law requiring the dmv to report traffic citations to insurance companies.	226	17	needadvice
This has been a seriously shitty week. I feel like I'm about to snap. I wrecked my car yesterday, which was 1000000-0o9000p0090o90ppo0o90i90o90% the other asshole's fault but my insurance is being a little fucking bitch about it because the cops couldn't find fault, I hate my job and all the retards I have to deal with, and soon I won't have a way to get to my shitty job because my car needs work to get street legal and nobody can give me a ride because they're working or too far away so it looks like I get to walk five miles to work. \n I left to go get milk today because all I want to eat is pancakes and some fucking missionary stopped me and I told him to shove his shitty bible fanfic up his ass which he probably didn't understand but fuck it. I was seeing red in a fucking grocery store. It's just fucking milk man. I feel like I'm going to fucking lose it if anyone even looks at me right now. \n fuck me	i hate my job, my car, my apartment, and apparently my shopping list and i  probably  for sure have an anger problem and I don't know what to do anymore man	179	31	needadvice

so my nan died a week ago tomorrow, my dad immediatly went up north to sort out funeral arrangments, he also went up because there is a problem with the inheritance, his sisters want a share of the inhritance and got my nan to sign a new will while she was in hospital, the original will (made by my long deseased grandfather left everything in my fathers name when my nan died). He also told my dad to look after his sisters and his mum when he had gone, he did this as best he could, one by staying home until he was 36 to support his mum and be there for her, two by remortgaging our house for a largesome of money to keep one of his sisters from losing her house after her divorce, his other sister has married well and has a large house and another in cyprus (not all paid for). this is where i get upset because after all he did for them, come up when they rang him for anything etc... they take 2/3 f his inheritance and my parents now hve to work until they are 70 just so they can retire and not leave me with debt when they die. one of my aunties wants her share to pay off her house in cyprus and the other hasno need for as her house is paid for and she only works 3 days a wekk as this pays all her bills (oh she may use some of it to pay off the rest of what she owes my dad from the money he gave her for the house). so when he went up i think he wanted to sort it out and maybe convince that he is in greate need of this inheritance as they have pretty nice lives. but hey just flat refused and laughed at him, he just went to her wake said good bye to his mother and i dont think he will ever peak to his family again, he said i can go to the funeral and i will to say goodbye to my nan but i dont know how i shoul act towards the people who have fucked my family financially, any opinions on this situation is welcome and if need be replied to \n thank you for your time	cant really be summed up sorry :/	391	7	needadvice

Recently one of my good friends went psychotic. He used to be very intelligent, quick-witted, and open-minded. Now he is unable to think logically or even to self-scrutinize. He has become a completely different person. We (my small circle of friends) think it was triggered mainly by LSD. He hasn't used it a lot, but it did trigger something in him. \n I myself have been noticing some strange and new things just from smoking weed, but I trip a lot too. I'm afraid I'm going to trigger schizophrenia. The thing is, the weed really helps my anxiety and depression, which are symptoms of my Asperger's. So I'm also a social mess. I'm terrified of medication. \n I can't manage to keep myself out of trouble. I was evicted from residence after the first month of university. I went back to the building last night to get help with a math problem from one of my old floormates, and my old RA called the campus cops on me. When I saw them coming I ran (bad past experiences with cops) but of course they caught me. \n I am suicidal, reckless, impulsive, severely lacking social skills, lacking motivation to the point where I am no longer motivated to move, my friends are all suicidal and now one is going through some sort of psychosis, and my psychologist is doing CBT with me to treat anxiety. He knows nothing of these other things because I've just started seeing him. I suppose I could tell him, but I plan on killing myself very soon so I don't see the point. \n This is a last-ditch attempt at something. You are all going to tell me to stop smoking pot and get my shit together. Weed is the only thing keeping me sane right now (lol but it may prove to cause my insanity, how ironic). It is the only thing I look forward to, it is the only thing that causes me to experience any sort of happy thoughts or feelings. Now even that is occasional with weed. My highs are increasingly punctuated with paranoid thoughts, scary thoughts. \n It's all very scary and big and I'm ready to die but at the same time something is keeping me alive. Just... Idek	just read it, okay? \n Also, I'm aware that I could be posting in mental health or wherever, but I want the largest amount of responses, the greatest variety of answers. I just want some help guys.	375	36	needadvice
Hi all hoping to get some advice. \n I recently went to purchase car that I thought was a fantastic deal. Got there drove it, excellent and at a great price. \n 85k on the OD \n I did a carfax report later that night and it showed 240k \n Like and idiot I should of done the car fax prior to meeting him. \n I gave the guy a 200 dollar deposit so I could return the next day to pay him the full amount. The next day I met him at his house (I have his address, name lic vin etc etc) Showed him the carfax asking for my deposit back, at least till it gets sorted. I mean his car did look immaculate. He claims it is false. I call up 3 of the companies on the list on carfax and all report over 200k on the car. \n Seller refuses to return the deposit. I am screwed. \n I don't know what I can do if anything. I'm out 200 (which I really need) but I think it will cost me more to pursue this in small claims. \n If I can't get the money back so be it. \nBut there should be some justice some where right? \n Thanks for listening to my rant	car seller reported false mileage will not return deposit. \n Edit: Thanking the seller for the invaluable lesson, one sample product at a time.	210	23	needadvice
over the past couple of months I've been seeing one of my friends less and less. he initially stated he was dating a girl / seeing his girlfriend and never really wanted to hang around any more. after a while this started to get a bit odd because neither me nor any of my friends had ever seen his girlfriend. (note that he needed to travel for an hour or so to see 'her' so it was logical that he didn't introduce us really early on) at that point we kinda started joking he might be gay. now recently he confessed to another friend of mine that he was actually gay after he was asking him about it. now if that wasn't awkward enough, he is dating somebody a lot older then him. my friend is in his early 20's and by the pictures i have seen of his friend i estimate him in his early 40's. when he confessed to my friend he told him that he really hated himself for being this way and he was really afraid of losing us as friends because of it. \n now i have zero problems with him being gay and i hate that he's scared of talking about it. i do find it really weird that he's seeing an older man. somehow i don't really understand why their together because it doesn't really strike as normal behavior for my friend. now i haven't talked about anything of this too him yet and i'm hoping you guys can give me some advice on how to deal with this situation and hopefully not make it too awkward	friend of mine is gay and dating an older man. how can i best be supportive for him	273	18	needadvice
Some background - I live in the UK and I'm doing Maths, Chemistry, Biology and English Literature for A level. I have no idea what career I want to go into. \n My parents are doctors so I spent a lot of my life thinking that I wanted to be a doctor; it seems so strange to even tentatively want anything else. I still think it would be an absolute privilege to be a doctor and neurology is one of my passions (unashamedly Ode to the Brain by melodysheep is my ring tone). I think that maybe I am good with people - I volunteer with a charity for women and with autistic children. I was voted vice president of our science club and I run chess club, so I really enjoy working with people. \n Here's the problem. Last year I took part in this competition called bar mock trial as a barrister and I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would. We ended up coming second in NI, so that added to my confusion a little bit. I also came third in NI for religious education and additional maths which makes me think that my aptitude lies elsewhere than medicine. I'm going to my school's prize day for English Lit, a subject I enjoy immensely, so would I would be better at law because I'm better at expressing myself? \n Also, seeing the effects that medicine has had on my parents makes me a little wary. They're both constantly stressed and it has really done a number on their health. On the other hand, law scares me a little because I don't consider myself as very ruthless, but then again maybe that's just an unfair idea I have about being a lawyer :) \n I guess I just need some outside opinions :) I'm sorry if I come across as being arrogant or boastful, I just wanted to add some information that could help :)	do I go into Law or Medicine? I think that my skills lie in law but neurology is a passion of mine :)	326	23	needadvice

my net capped today, so my mother blamed me, which resulted in an argument which got me kicked out while i was doing uni work thats due tomorrow. \n so my family keeps on capping the internet, my mother blames me because i am the most tech savvy and oldest, my 12yo brother streams stuff and plays games all the time, but he occasionally connects to the neighbours wifi so he usually has an alibi. \n and no one has hacked into our internet i'm pretty sure, iv'e tried showing her my torrent schedules and making sure my computer is off during the day, but she is adamant i can boot up wirelessly and change all these settings (i can but i choose not too) so she never even hears my side. and shuts me down every time we discuss it (there was a time where she blamed me while i was gone the entire week)	how would i be able to show my mother that im not capping our bandwith?\nand how can i get her to listen? \n also the amount we downloaded this month was 180gb (100 on peak which capped it, 80 off, HOW THE FUCK DOES THAT EVEN HAPPEN)	154	47	needadvice
Hi reddit! \n I recently called my little sister (only 14 years old) to find that she's experiencing a bunch of health issues. Her symptoms include joint pain, chest pain, difficulty breathing, short term memory loss, and difficulty concentrating in school. She also gets rashes when she goes outside sometimes. \n I'm in college and don't live at home so I only found this out today. I asked her a bunch of questions, and she said that these symptoms have been around since January but were MUCH more mild. I AM VERY VERY WORRIED. \n She has seen a bunch of doctors (cardiologist, dermatologist, therapist etc). They ran a bunch of tests which won't be ready for a couple days. Until I find out what's going on with her, I am probably going to let this freak me out. I can't stop thinking about it. \n I'm not looking for a diagnosis, just some comfort on this situation. Should I be worrying so much?? Any stores of anyone experiencing similar symptoms...PLEASE SHARE. \n Thank you guys	little sister is experiencing some weird symptoms (joint pain, chest pain, memory loss)...how can I cope with this? \n Edit: thanks for the responses! I am still worried but hopefully things will get better	171	33	needadvice
I need some support and advice from you all, this has been playing on my mind all weekend, I just can't digest the situation. \n Last month my whole department was called into a meeting, our boss and the Head of HR announced that there is to be a restructure and unfortunately there could be redundancies. As a group we were shocked, our department has not grown inline with other departments in the last few years, we have major projects to deliver as well as the usual tasks, so we had thought we needed to expand not contract. \n Our team has been together for many years, we are friends as well as trusted colleagues, this has made the situation very stressful for us all. \n The boss who has delivered this has only been with the company for six months. I had thought that we had all found a good working relationship within the team, now I'm not so sure. \n At this point our most junior member has been told their role is no longer required to meet the business goals. She has been offered a role in another department at a different location at a serious pay cut. This is still to be confirmed in writing. \n I have been told my role is safe and have also received a generous bonus. I have mixed feelings over this, happy/relieved to be safe, glad that i have some extra money but both are consumed by a sense of guilt at the situation. \n We also have a new employee, at manager level, an ex colleague of our boss. The role was not advertised and no one else was interviewed. \n I don't know what the rest of the department are going to do, one thing is certain our moral is very low. I am aware of people having interviews in their lunch hour. I don't want to lose anyone else from the team. I feel powerless to turn this around, is beginning to feel like an end of days. \n I love my job, I feel really lucky. I had respected my management but now I have questions about ethics and morality. Do I want to work for a company that behaves like this? I'm really struggling to come to terms with this. \n Part of me wants to discuss this in the open with the whole group, to get everything out in the open, this would probably be my career suicide, I just don't know what to do! \n I have thought over this for too long so Reddit please give me some good advice. \n Thank you in advance	new boss makes junior employee redundant and brings in ex colleague in new role. I'm questioning my bosses morals and ethics. How do I come to terms with this? \n I'm using a throwaway for anonymity \n Edited for typos	432	38	needadvice
"Ok so backstory- My friend, lets call him Tim, is the smartest kid in our grade. We're in grade 11 And me and Tim have been friends since beginning of last year sort of. We've become super good friends and we hang out all the time and all that teenage stuff (I'm a guy he's a guy btw(nohomo)). So anyways he's super smart like corrects the teachers and stuff like that. You see him and think ""man this kids going places"". So then you get to his home life. He lives In a trailer park with his mom and his abusive, wheelchair ridden dad. They both have cancer. Doctors are saying that they'll both be dead within the year because they think its terminal. This worries me. Tim will bring it up in like ""let's see who has the saddest story"" conversations and the whole place goes quiet but he sort of jokes about it. He's gonna get put in a foster home if they both die. Me and my other friend really don't want to see this happen. We've been saying if this does happen, one of us wants to take him in (although we haven't ran it by our parents yet) but I just don't know what to do. If this does happen, do we just let him get put in a home? My family has 3 kids and two dogs so were pretty full but the other kids an only child. So is Tim. The other kid will bring Tim into his home. Idk reddit. Do we just let this all happen and do nothing?

I am currently 19 yrs old, i have done the hsc but didn't get into any university. I've also went to do a cert IV in a course but failed badly. So i decided on my own to find a job, went through the interview state and confess to my parents about the situation. They didn't like the fact that i was applying for this kind of this which is commission sales. My parents have stated that these kind of company will rip you off and such as well as they'll lure you into selling drugs and other non-sense, as well as saying that one of my uncles friend did this and they got caught selling(what i just explained previously) as well as that i should focus on study even though they wanted me to either work or go study. \n What should i do?

What I am: I'm a university party guy, so confident that I could be wearing lingerie ;). \n What I'm stuck with: People seem to get frustrated talking to me. I'm deaf.

Be able to remember well and make people laugh and feel awesome. (Not trying to be a douche btw) \n What happens: I dance, people talk to me, we can't seem to communicate well. I make social blunders (a friend said I was acting creepy/weird that I'm too nice in that I want something?).

"I've always been smart, the home I was brought up in I had a dad that was a tutor of philosophy, psychology, sociology, critical thinking, and another I forgot. With a mum who was also very smart, and myself always reading (I wasn't a loner, I was very popular). In school I was also the chatty, disruptive kid (The work was easy and boring for me) but then at that time I could coast by on natural intelligence. That changed slowly and eventually I wasn't talking because the work was easy, but because it was hard. I still managed to coast through though.

In an effort to keep my story short, I'll write it in bullet point form. \n \n I am a graduating undergrad with a BS in Economics \n I breezed through college doing nothing more than playing video games, occasionally partying, learning guitar, making (awesome) friends, and working pointless part-time jobs which imparted me with no skills \n I have been depressed for the past 8 years and have foolishly never sought help for it, despite my parents both being on antidepressants.  \n However, this past year I have felt better than I ever have been due to meeting great new people, having a much more active social life, focusing on my studies, ditching video games, and working out a lot \n Unfortunately, I still don't know what I want to do with my life. I graduated high school with good grades and a great resume, but had no focus, rushed into college, and ultimately went from a top tier student to an uninspired, middle of the road one.  \n I'm flirting with the idea of biting the bullet and pursuing a MS in computer science (which my brother is doing) just so that I can have a guaranteed future. I know it will be a ton of work, but I am mature enough to handle it this time.  \n I don't have a job lined up, and every posting I look at requires experience and technical skills I don't have. At the moment, I've been applying to entry-level jobs at companies  that work in education technology (Blackboard and IXL so far, I'd love to hear about others). This field vaguely interests me and it is all I have to go on right now. I've had several tutoring gigs and loved them. I don't see much of a future in teaching, though. \n I've started studying some CS on the side, but only for the past month. I have almost completed an intro python class via MIT online and am slowly working my way through another intro python textbook. Eventually, I want to study HTML and Javascript, too, and get into mobile app development \n \n So that's my	"story. I ask this: am I on the right track?

"Hi /r/needadvice, \n I came to the realization just recently that I am a sufferer of agoraphobia.  I don't think I fit the clinical definition of it since I don't fear leaving my house.  If I need to go to either of my 2 jobs, no problem.  If I need to go to school, no problem.  If I need to take a short drive around town to do some errands like picking up groceries, no problem. \n I don't start suffering from it until I have some free time and somebody I know is interested in going out to see a movie, see a concert, go out to a bar, go out to a party, and even a casual get together, like a Super Bowl gathering.  99% of my friends live 30 minutes away from me or more.  The drive up to my friends' places that are this far from me feels super stressful, when it doesn't need to be at all.  I am a timid person and never host anything near where I live.  That's probably a whole different story, though. \n If it's an evening activity planned on any given night, my dinner appetite will curb as my stomach starts bothering me due to the anxiety of knowing what I'll be doing later.  Leisure activities are supposed to be fun, right?  Not in my case.  It's quite sad for me to even think about it, how others can go out and have fun and I sit home and worry about everything. \n I don't feel safe around anyone unless it's an immediate family member.  I'm not a trusting person either, so I have 0 close friends.  Hell, I'm lucky I have at least 1 friend at all with how distant and closed off of a person I am.  I like being nice to people and knowing good people, but I don't know how the whole ""two way street"" thing works to make a friendship. \n I take no medication for it and never will take any medication for it because it won't help me. \n So as my title indicates, tell me your personal experiences of going through agoraphobia and the recovery process. \n Thank you to everyone in advance who replies and I appreciate you all taking the time to read my case.  Hopefully I don't get any """	"s"" from you! Hah!"	385	4	needadvice

I got polio in my left leg when I was 3....had the leg braces, had to do some intense leg exercises till I was about 11. Around the age of 9 I could walk unsupported again but my left leg will never catch up with my right leg and that's ok. \n I obviously had a great deal of adjusting to do. I grew up ashamed of my legs...did stupid shit like wearing extra pants under my school uniform...I was convinced it was all people saw. I got bullied a lot growing up, fuck those people. My first relationship really helped me overcome this. He told me I had nice legs the first time we got intimate, I hadn't told him I had/have polio, so it wasn't a pity thing. After that I started wearing only one pair of pants...oh I do feel silly remembering that but thankfully, over time I developed self confidence. There is just so much more to me than that. I love my long legs. \n People can't tell they just think I have a odd way of walking. I had to learn to walk all over again. I don't quite remember if it's thanks to the physiotherapist or my mum but the way I walk is extremely feminine, covers up my limp slightly. Most people think I'm vain other people know why. Some people do ask why I walk like that and if I tell them they seem shocked...hell most people don't know what polio is. \n Now to my question, I'm 23 years old now and I've started to notice it more....that my left leg is shorter and a lot weaker, I get tired very quickly and it just feels like my muscles are weaker in general. I recently read about the post polio syndrome....so even after all that shit there is apparently a 66% chance I will get it again, maybe I'm just freaking myself out because of that maybe it's all in my head? \n I've always done yoga but I've become more active lately. I'm unsure weather I should keep pushing myself or just accept I have weaker muscles and stick to mild exercises and I'd just really like to hear from someone who has had it. \n I developed it in Nigeria migrated to the England when I was 9. I've never really met or spoken to anyone who had or has polio.\nThis also helps me get this off my chest	had polio when I was 3 starting to feel weaker, want to hear from anyone who has had it.	407	19	needadvice
Long story short, my mom is probably kicking me out of my grandpas house (power of attorney) and my lease with my universities housing ends June 15th. I currently have ~$2,500 in my bank account and I've been applying for jobs without much luck. I've already asked the university if they could extend the lease and I doubt they're going to do it. \n However, I just signed up with a professional staffing firm called RobertHalf and someone emailed me (an alumni at my university, actually) and tried to call me but I was grocery shopping at the time.

My brother is not a particularly troubled kid, but he has been messing up a lot due to lack of motivation and possible depression. My parents have asked if I would let him come live with me in a nearby city (5 hrs from home) to try and get him to change. \n Background: \n I am the oldest of 4 (three girls, one boy)  with my brother being the youngest. We are all very close in age and although my parents try not to compare us, my brother has expressed that it was very hard to grow up in the shadow of my fairly overachieving siblings. \n He has just graduated high school, where he got good grades (As/Bs) in classes he enjoys, and failed those which he didn't find interesting because he chose to not complete his homework or study for exams. This behavior resulted in his expulsion from one private school and nearly kept him from graduating this spring. \n He is supposed to be starting college in the fall but he refuses to sign up for orientation, look at his course catalog or register for classes. If my parents try to talk to him about it, he completely shuts down. He often stays locked up in his room until the early evening and only comes out when he gets hungry. My mother is a therapist herself and has tried many times to get him to speak to a professional but he refuses and even has gotten violent. Normally, he is a very sweet, albeit lazy kid who is your typical nonathletic, video-game obsessed teen boy, but he was also generally extroverted and had a lot of friends. Now he seems to be alone too much but he insists nothing has changed. \n Problem:  I don't know if him coming to live with me (temporarily) will help. I only graduated college a couple of years ago and finally am in a position where I have the space and time to try and help, but to be perfectly honest, I don't know how to get through to him. At his age I was a bit of a slacker, but I always worked part time (something he also refuses to do), and got good enough grades to earn a spot in a great school. I just want the best for him and his behavior is not only negatively impacting his own life but it has also caused my parents to fight constantly about how to deal with him. I just want to know what other people have done to get a confused teen back on track. Do you think I can help? What suggestions do you have to get him motivated? \n I would really appreciate anyone's insight or opinions.	little brother is completely unmotivated and in a very negative place.

"Really wasn't too sure where to go with this question so if anyone could redirect me to a sub that would better suit my question that would be great! \n Anyhow, quick note: I'm a college student working as a summer camp counselor for kids ages 5-12. \n Today, we had a new camper: an 11 year old boy, who presented more issues for the other counselors and I than I had ever experienced. After shoving and hitting multiple kids, telling me he hated summer camp and hated me, talking about depression and dying and presenting a HUGE attitude problem, I sat down to talk with him. \n When I tried to talk to him at first, I tried being stern and assertive with him because I thought that may combat his major attitude. After he continued to act out and matched my assertive tone with an assertive tone of his own, telling me he wasn't afraid of me, I tried a new technique. \n I sat down and asked him what issues he had with camp and what I could do to help him have a good day. I went on to tell him if there was anything going on outside of camp that he wanted to talk about, that he could trust me and that I would try my best to help him out. He repeatedly said he wanted to go home to do ""better things"" that are ""none of my business"" and that he ""despised"" being around little kids. At this point I told my supervisor who then contacted his mom. \n The child's mom told my supervisor that her son has Oppositional Defiant Disorder and basically that there was nothing we could do. Of course, as a counselor, I want to help this boy out and try to make his summer at camp one that he can enjoy but I really don't know how or what else to do. Any advice would be extremely appreciated! Thanks so much."	11 year old at summer camp has oppositional defiant disorder and I need advice on how to handle it!	327	19	AskParents
"My grandson just turned 7 and his annual physical is coming up. \n He asked his parents if he could see a male doctor this time instead of his usual female pediatrician - essentially because he feels more comfortable discussing his health and discussing more private symptoms like constipation with someone of his same gender. They also check his testicles etc. every year, and in this same discussion he made it very clear he did not want a woman down there. \n His parents are resisting because they said they want to teach their son that female doctors are just as competent as male doctors. \n I don't think that has anything to do with their son's request. He isn't saying  she  isn't competent he's saying  he  isn't comfortable. It's about him, not the doctor. I feel very strongly that his wishes should be respected, and I told them so (politely and tactfully). They said ""Why support negative gender stereotypes that society has impressed on our son to make him think he'd be better off with a male doctor? At his age there isn't a difference between the sexes."" Well... if he's saying he's uncomfortable then he's picked up on a difference. \n To me gender politics are totally irrelevant here. He has no problem with his female dentist, or his female teacher, or his female basketball coach! But he wants to discuss his bowel movements, rashes, and gas, with somebody he can more closely identify with. \n I support gender equality across the board and don't think it's necessary to default to having a doctor who shares your gender (my own GP is a man), but if you're uncomfortable you should be able to choose, regardless of age. For example, I still won't see a male gynecologist. Not because I think men aren't as capable at gynecology as women, but because it just makes me uncomfortable. I'm not required to explain myself, and I don't think my grandson should be either. \n I hate how they're trying to make this about politics when it's supposed to be about their son. If he said he was uncomfortable with a male doctor and wanted to switch to a female, would they be protesting? I doubt it. \n I don't want him to have any more of a negative connotation about going to the doctor than kids already do, and as he gets a little older and begins to go through puberty then his feelings of discomfort will only intensify. \n How can I advocate for him without making the parents feel as though I'm trying to come between them and their child or contradict their decision making on some sort of political grounds? They usually don't like input on their parenting tactics, but I feel they are really doing wrong by my grandson. I need them to see that we're on the same team in that we both just want what's best for him. \n Any suggestions on how to broach this subject with them would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

"Every year I go home to California from NY to visit friends and family.\nFor the past 5 or 6 years i've stayed with my best friend so I can see her more. Her lifestyle didn't include a lot of going out, even before the baby. She said her husband needed her there or else he wont prepare nutritious food, and will eat fast food and have health problems (he is not disabled.) \n Everything stayed pretty much the same when she was pregnant, and when the baby was a few months old. We would catch up during breakfast while she fed the baby, or I played with him, and it was cool because I got to see her without interfering with her life or dragging her to things she didn't wanna do. \n This last visit was different. I came over, her house was a wreck, the carpet was covered in crumbs, and piles of things were everywhere. She came in w her husband, the baby was sleeping in the car (in the garage which was nearby so we can hear him wake up) I asked if she wanted to get food, and it would be like 30 minutes, her husband said sure w/e ill watch him. She said no, ""he'll wake up and need me."" \n I was hungry and had to be somewhere else so I left and she said we can do it later, or go to the beach. We tried to do those things, but every time she would say the baby had to nap between 10-11 and again at 2-3, but the baby would over nap and the whole schedule would be shifted, or he would throw a fit, and she would be unable to leave. One day, they did manage to make it to the beach for a couple minutes, but as soon as they got there the baby started to cry so they took him home. \n I tried to see her again when her mom was watching the baby, but before she got home she called me and said the baby had to sleep, and sorry she'll see me later. That was cool, she was probably tired. \n The next day I came for a few minutes, it would have been longer but the baby wasn't awake yet so I couldn't come. She cant have people over when he's napping because he only likes to nap on her and she doesn't want him woken up. \n She did try to make an effort, and text me her schedule. The baby's schedule, and temperament however, kept getting in the way so I stopped making it a priority. \n I am sad that I didn't see her as much, but totally okay because she's busy and I don't wanna starve in her house while I watch the baby cry. I think I put in the right amount of effort considering I was staying 40 minutes away, and I was only around for a week, but she seems hurt that we weren't able to do anything. \n I don't know how to apologize, or explain why we didn't see each other, without sounding like I wanted to do more fun things, and not drive out of the way to watch a baby yell, and then have to leave.

"I've never asked for parenting advice before and I am not 100% sure if I should have asked here or on /r/parenting. \n We have a happy healthy 20 month old little girl and we always planned on having just two children due to our financial situation we knew that we would be able to give two children a lot more and do a lot more with them. We tried for just one more and when we found out we were pregnant via pregnancy test we immediately ran out to get a blood test to be certian. \n We made an appointment with the midwives that delivered our first daughter and we went for our first appointment the very next week and they scheduled an ultrasound for us since the midwives don't do their ultrasounds in-house. We went for our ultrasound the next day and at this point my wife tells me that she thinks there may be twins instead of just one. To our surprise and the surprise of our ultrasound tech, as soon as she laid the wand down on my wife's abdomen two fetuses were visible on the screen. My wife started to cry asking about twins. The ultrasound tech started to freak out a little bit more and ask if we had InVitro and we told her no. At that point in time there were four. Natural quadruplets. \n The ultrasound place sent the results to the midwives and they were blowing up my wife's phone the next day freaking out saying that they couldn't see us and we needed to find another doctor. We ended up doing some research on various high risk OB's in the area and found one who specializes in multiples. We made an appointment and went. He ended up being a fantastic doctor and really calmed our nerves about the whole multiple situation. \n At 12 weeks we found out that the fetus closest to my wife's cervix's heart stopped beating and was most likely unviable. Our Doctor believes it had genetic abnormalities related to a partial molar pregnancy because of the Cystic placenta. At 13 weeks he preformed a transvaginal cerclage on my wife to help her carry as long as possible and we went for our most recent ultrasound a few days ago at 15 weeks. \n All three viable babies are growing normally and are very active. They don't seem to show any signs of abnormalities and their NT Scans all looked normal. The Cystic placenta and the unviable fetus are still there but they are the same size they were at 12 weeks. The babies were 3oz, 4oz, and 3oz with heartbeats of 145, 148, and 143. \n Now to thw real meat of my problem. Nobody in my family or my wife's family has ANY expierence with multiples even though twins ""run in her family"" nobody that has had twins is still living. My family is mostly a child light family with people either having 1-2 children or none at all so they have no expierence either. \n Getting ready for our first was easy and it stopped being that scary first time parent expierence fast. Triplets terrify me and I have no idea how we should prepare or what we should look forward to or expect once they actually get home. I'm nowhere near as knowledgeable this time as I was last time because with our first my little sister was 13 years younger than me so I remembered how to deal with a baby fairly well.

We talked about having kids before getting married and were both on the same page for definitely one and probably two and then see what life is like from there.

Hello, /r/Parenting , I'm actually not a parent, I'm only 15, and I've got two little sisters who are turning 4 and 5 and love to watch videos on my android phone and tablet. However, I don't think it's healthy to let them keep watching them for a long time. I think I'm going to use the feature that allows me to set the limit on how long they can watch the videos. The kind of videos they watch are mostly: roleplays, toy reviews, and other How should I approach them and tell them about this? I watch allot of YouTube, but the videos are typically about Tech, programming, or video games, and are typically more educational. It's difficult to get them to recognize me as an authority figure and I can understand that, as I'm their brother rather than a parent, but I'd like to understand my reasoning and come off as little of a hypocrite to them as possible. My mom has advised me to give them other alternatives. I know it's biased but I don't mind if they play games that require real interaction. Anything that can train their reflexes or require them to think or be creative is, find with me. My goal isn't to substitute real human interactive experiences with these games, but to give them something more to do rather than watch YTKids. If this is a good idea, please let me know what games I should get them to challenge their minds. They can't quite read yet, but they are very intelligent.

People just enjoy relating to each other over current events. It makes them feel like they aren't alone. If you don't like the content then ignore it or contribute something else.

I think you certainly have a point about the need to dress up in certain environments and on certain occasions. As you said, there are issues of respect and etiquette involved, and while I'm personally a lover of casual clothing, and generally hold a distaste for formal wear, I wouldn't be caught dead in anything remotely casual if i were offered an invite to an opera performance. I'd go to my battlestation, do my hair/makeup as well as I possibly could, wear my best dress and heels, and try to focus on the performance instead of how uncomfortable I was through the event, because I really enjoy opera, concerts, plays, etc. The formal wear is always a burden for me, but it's a necessary one, I feel. \n Though admittedly, as a student, I'm not going to wear anything formal to class. Mostly because my professors generally wear business casual at most, and that means I can get away with wearing something that's casual, but looks nice on me. I'll make sure my hair is down or in a neat bun, too. I won't go to school in pajamas and bunny slippers like some in my school do, but I'm not about to wear a bunch of business casual stuff when I need to take public transport to school, and often take a nature trail as a shortcut to campus. I'm not about to walk 15 minutes in heels in snowy/rainy weather across uneven paved paths full of people on bikes and walking their dogs. Some weatherproofed boots or sneakers will do the job better and make sure I won't roll my ankle. \n In general, I know I personally dress down. I have such a low amount of funds it's ridiculous, so getting things that are comfy and fashionable? That's rare, especially with my city's temps fluctuating from hot as hell to frigid at hell throughout the year. Getting more expensive stuff usually is a twice annually thing that might happen on my birthday/Christmas. Unless higher end shops like Nordstroms (at least, Nordstroms is higher end for me, but I'm poor, so...) drop their prices and have assistants help me pick stuff out that will flatter my oddly shaped body, I'll stick with thrift shop finds and cheap black friday/boxing day deals that'll replace articles in my wardrobe that have seen better days. I can try to make myself look somewhat fancy with what I have if I spend an hour and a bit on my makeup and by sacrificing my hair for the rest of the week (or condemning me to a 40-50 minute wash later on if I decide to take that plunge) if I want to style it one day. That's a lot of prep for 6-8 hours of class, an hour on transit, and maybe 30 minutes out if I need to get groceries or go to work (where my hair length means it's put in a ponytail or bun). \n I mean, effort is great, but it's the appearance of effort that matters to people. One of my good friends tosses on a suit every day of the week. Spends a few minutes at night ironing. Gets up in the morning and is dressed in 3 minutes, max. Looks nice, but it's no effort for him to do that. It was an effort to afford his wardrobe, but it's no effort to 'dress up' and make sure his hair is alright. I think there's a pattern of equating effort with upscale clothing, which can rule out people of lower socioeconomic status, making them work harder to be seen as making the same 'effort'. \n So...my	is that there are definitely environments and situations where we, in general, dress down, but I don't think doing so in everyday situations is a bad thing at all.	607	29	other
"Hi guys,\nI'm 26M and she's 23F. \n So I've recently started ""hanging out"" (We haven't called them dates even though we both like each but she was initially ""scared"" to call it a date) with a girl I've known for a while.... We have been out 3 times together in a 1 on 1 situation, so far things have been pretty good and got along well. \n However last time there were a few awkward silences and patches of silence where both us seemed to run out of things to talk about, I'm guessing that's a little common when getting to know someone though. Despite the few awkward silences she still seemed to really really enjoy herself and said she would like to go out again soon. \n So my main question is what can I do and what kind of questions can I ask to keep the conversations going and flowing easier during those awkward silences? This is the first girl I've been interested in since my long term relationship of 7 years ended last year, so I'm not too experienced with ""wooing"" women."	How can I keep conversations flowing?

"So I get a 'wink' from a girl on match.com. Cool. I go check out her profile and 'wink' back at her, but thats all either of us can really do because neither of us have full paid accounts (or so I assume this of her). however in her ""about me"" section she says she owns a specific type of business in town. Being a small town I knew there couldn't be many of those types of business and sure enough after a quick google search I found a name, googled it, and found her myspace page which she hasn't been on in over 2 years (just like most people). I now know her first middle and last name, her business name, address, and phone number. What I couldn't find is a Facebook profile or Email address. \n I'm hesitant to contact via her business info because that to me at least would rate pretty high on the creep scale.

"So here it goes. I'm a 26 male that has completely been out of the dating game for the last 6 or so years. 3 of which I was in a relationship (funny enough, it started on facebook, when it was when first came out). Beyond that for the last 3 years I've done nothing with the other sex. \n I went on a float trip 2 or 3 weeks ago and there were a ton of 21 somethings there, obviously new to drinking and what have you. I tried to strike up conversation with a girl there that I found attractive and it was just small talk, which didn't go anywhere. \n This float trip was with a group of close friends and then me and another friend went along. I had a good time and participated in group activities and was not an outcast. People knew my name and drinking games helped :p. \n Long story short I gathered up the courage to send a message to this girl on facebook after the trip. No response for 2 weeks and 4 days and then today I got this: \n Sorry! Wasn't a great week at that time. How are you holding up? Happy late forth of July! \n The last girl I had a long term relationship with I also met on facebook but after the last 6 years I think the game has changed. Back then all I had to do was act dumbfounded that we were already friends and keep the dialog going for it go somewhere. All the while I already knew we were friends on facebook because of me drunk adding pretty girls. \n I want to try a little bit with this girl because she seems ""hip"" in the video games and nerd way which is cool and she looks to be a 6 or 7ish on my radar. \n How can I keep the dialog going and expect a return dialog with not knowing much about the girl? Acting dumbfounded at 26 about facebook i don't think will work as its been around too long now. It was out for maybe a year back then. \n Thanks in advance."

"I see a lot of people in here talking about exercise and a lot of other ideas. Yes, exercise is great for strength and health, but when it comes to weight loss, the only thing that really matters is diet. That extra 200 calories you burned after that hour on the tread mill ain't doing nothing if you eat an extra portion at dinner because you're more hungry because you worked out. \n Adding to this a lot of ""healthy"" foods are still calorie dense, (whole grain, avocado, nuts, fruit) and while fine and even needed in small amounts, (got to have the good fats and vitamins,) they should be consumed sparingly. Basically you're looking to eat foods that are as calorie poor as possible. When I'm cutting weight, I alternate mainly between chicken and broccoli and spinach and tuna."

I dated my college sweetheart again in our late 20s, after she'd racked up a divorce and a kid.  Because of her attitudes, there was a point a few months in where I realized that I'd never - NEVER - be anything but 3rd fiddle after her child, and herself.  Furthermore, even when we were engaged to be married, I came to realize that I would never be seen as/allowed to be/or respected as a real father and stakeholder in the kid's life.  Fortunately, she dumped me because I was drawing unemployment benefits (seriously, not because I was unemployed during the housing crisis, but because I drew my available unemployment benefits from the state, which irked her Republican sensibilities.), and a man with her idea of a good education passed through her life for a night... \n I should have left the moment I realized that she would never be a real partner; known that the partner-ship had sailed (ba-dum-tss) for her, and she was out to get what she could for her and her child.  When she finally dumped me, she went from seriously planning a wedding (for the second time in our 3-ish year relationship) to dating the new guy in less than a month.

As someone who handles auditing resumes, setting up interviews etc for the department director I will say it would take A LOT more then 5 minutes to reply to every applicant. I'm talking floods of resumes and a serious time waster. I can understand the frustration / disappointment of not hearing back but you need to understand our jobs encompass a lot more then just looking through resumes so yea I honestly don't have the time to reply to every single one. \n Couple that with the fact that a good 75% of resumes are completely non-applicable or show the person simply didn't read the job post (I ask people to write the answer to a SIMPLE math problem.to show they actually read the post) you will realize that the vast majority of applicants are just spamming their resume out there and have no respect for the process either.

"I've been known to criticizing that the norm is to keep your mouth shut when shit goes down in a bad neighborhood. Although I admit that I am somewhat sheltered compared to some claims in the comments, I have formed an opinion over several discussions with friends and family. \n Not snitching has worse consequences in the long run for the entire community. \nbecause that's when police stop taking the whole neighborhood seriously, therefore stamping the whole community sub-human/not worth the effort, and any criminal can get away with almost anything they want, and the hood-mentality spreads, the problems pile up, the next generation of young men learn to survive under this mentality and eventually become criminals themselves, and it creates a vicious cycle. \n The root of the problem seems to be, that the collective frustration of the community, is molding the individuals to what most of us would deem negative behavior. And the financial situation pushes young men to doing illegal business that start out small and at some point they clash into other criminals and you have no other choice than to exert dominance. Resulting in a situation whereas an innocent bystander is subjected to a murder or gun-violence etc. in a neighborhood that has little chance of being taken seriously by the police. \n This premise of ""Da PoLiz AintZ gonG ProteKses mA ass ManG"", and the premise of eye-witnesses not willing to talk, because they're scared for their own life, is way too embedded in the system to be stopped now. \n So my conclusion is:\nIf you want to be safe, don't snitch."

So basically, I've been dating a girl for about 6 weeks. Last sunday out of nowhere she stopped texting me. At first, I thought she must just be busy. then two days passed I figured a wild couple of days. Then 3 days passed and I started thinking the worst with the possibility that she may have a genuine excuse like a lost or broken phone. Then four days and I was just plain upset. \n So I texted her again basically saying what the hell. I said if shes not interested then that was entirely her perogative, but I told her my feelings. I told her that the not knowing is like torture. \n I eventually get a reply at 3.45 am saying that she just needed some space to think. which is fine. I'm fine with that. she apologised for being an arsehole and said she wants to meet up in person to talk about stuff shes been thinking recently. I texted back saying thats fine. I told her I adore her too much to hold a grudge but also asked if this talk is just stuff thats been bothering her or if its the kind of talk that I'm going to go away feeling crushed from. No answer (I didn't expect one till 2ish as she sleeps late and works late). \n Got to quitting time and I told her I was leaving work and ready to talk whenever she wants to... \n Over 13 hours since the text I sent this morning, I've not heard anything back yet. I appreciate she might have alot on her plate at the moment that I don't know about.. but I don't know what to do about the fact that right now, I'm sat here feeling miserable. fearing the worst, trying to decipher what talking about stuff would entail. I feel lonelier now than what I did before I met her.. I mean, I've been lonely my entire life. I've never really been popular .. I'm a nice guy but I don't have much practice with girls. I know 13 hours isn't in reality all that long. but I really dont like this feeling. I really really quite like this girl. from the way she holds herself to the random facial hairs she's embarrassed by. But right now I feel shit, and i feel its a pretty dick move from her making me feel like this...

Hi Reddit, \n My grandfather passed away a few years ago and my aunt, who had Power of Attorney during his last few years, has repeatedly refused to sell his home and other property and distribute all the inheritance between herself and the 3 remaining children, including my mother. This aunt has been lucky enough to earn a college degree, work a nice job until retirement and has her own retirement fund, along with her husband and his retirement they live a pretty easy life. My mom hasn't had the same opportunities and lacks security. I live overseas and would love to have her visit, but she never can because she worries about funds and job security. \n Anyway, my mother and sisters suspect my aunt is using my grandfather's money for her own personal use and she will not discuss the inheritance with them, they are almost not on speaking terms over it and this has never happened. Any advice on what my mom and her sisters can do to make sure they get their fair share before my aunt spends more than what's due to her?

r/legaladvice, \n this is my first time coming here, but I'm hoping someone can steer me in the proper direction.  I guess this is actually more to do with my fiancee, but I'm trying to help her figure out what to do - I'll try to keep it concise. \n We live in a city in south-western, Pennsylvania (I don't want to get her in trouble), and she works for a large company.  She's been employed there as a salaried employee for approximately a a year and eight months, but for the last year she's had far greater responsibilities than her pay grade and position warrants.  She now regularly works long hours, and almost every month she has to take a three day trip to New York City where she's working 13 hour days with little to no break. \n She's kept her head down and worked hard with an understanding from her supervisor and manager that she's on the short list for a promotion and a raise, but there's been a lot of talk and no action.  Recently there has been a string of promotions in different departments and with executives, despite there being a freeze on promotions.  It has left her irked and asking her superiors if there is something that she should be doing that will help her situation, but it is always the same answer. \n There has also been a recent issue with overtime pay with a large group of employees that forced the company to switch them to hourly and cut them off once they would reach overtime.  Certain employees like my fiancee were told they were exempt because of their responsibilities, so they were continued to be worked at the same amount at the same pay.  Looking through her contract it lists her salary but also lists her as a non-exempt employee.  If the company is able to reclassify her as exempt does this mean the terms of her employment has changed and her original contract is void?  If the original contract holds, does this mean that she is entitled to back pay?  Sorry if this is long winded, she's just been having trouble getting anywhere with her superiors, seemingly because their hands are tied, and we're trying to figure out if there is something she can do.  Any advice before taking this to the next level would be appreciated.

I really can't even believe how ignorant you are to this subject. Obama_Christ even gave you black and white proof with the numbers all there and you still act like it's just because he's a lazy freeloader.

"I met a girl outside of a club last weekend and we ended up making out and fooling around all night long. No sex, she's a virgin, which is good and bad. It was really romantic and we cuddled and stayed up all night talking and joking around in between really hot topless fun. \n So we've hung out every chance we've had since then and it's the same thing: we can't keep our hands off each other and when I drop her off at her apartment it takes 30 minutes for us to stop kissing before she leaves. It's awesome, she's beautiful, she's everything I've ever wanted in a girl, but I don't know how to feel about a couple of comments that she made last night. \n She talked about how she gets bored really fast with guys and was honestly a little afraid she was going to do that with me. I told her I had pretty much done the same thing lately (I had like 5 ""girlfriends"" over the summer) and we laughed about how flakey we both were. Then she told me I was allowed to do whatever I wanted with other girls for now, she knows I like sex and that she couldn't give me that so she claims to have no issue with me having sluts on the side. This threw me for a loop and I said I wasn't really like that. But obviously then I had to say that she was also free to do whatever she wanted with other guys, and she was like yeah I know I am. \n So after we had sat in her parking lot for about an hour and a half fooling around the moment seemed really romantic and I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend. It got awkwardly quiet and I said, sorry I know its too soon, and she was like yeah it really is. So now I don't know what to do. Should I not pursue more than this right now with her? Should I give her some space and let her pursue whatever other options she may have, and spend some more time banging slutty girls, as per her comments?

I've been in a relationship with this girl for a month and a half now. I should begin by saying that this is my first relationship, my first everything. \n I don't have a problem talking with girls, flirting and the usual stuff. The problem is that I get attached too quickly, and when things go bad , I start to over think. \n We've been talking for four months now, didn't start with a relationship in mind, but we've really connected and we got here. She's not the first girl I talked to, not the first I asked out, but I definitely feel like she's the one I with whom I've had the best connection. \nAbout 1-2 weeks ago, she really changed. She became cold, direct, and doesn't really care if what she says affects us. She's been having some issues with her roommate, with the city we live in(we're in college away from home), basically she hates it. She asked me for some space after things started to go bad with her mood. She said she wanted to be alone, to get her thoughts in order, just a few days, and to stop thinking about it, as it has nothing to do with me, and I'm hurting myself by doing it. The things is, she still goes out a lot with a girlfriend from college, almost daily, and sometimes with friends of that girl as well. We kind of talked about this, and she blamed it on her problem. I decided to give her some space, but we still talk. \n The problem is, I have a problem with anxiety, and over thinking. I think about how she goes out with this girl more than she does with me, I think about stuff that I know is in no way true, and sometimes I don't think about anything and I still feel like shit.  I knew I had this problem, and it was something I was hoping to work on before I got into a relationship. Now, for the past few days, I've been having trouble falling asleep, eating, I have this weird feeling in my chest most of the time.

I've been looking for ways to improve my self confidence, to control my mind better(meditation).I realise that they are just in my mind. I know that clearing my mind it's not an immediate process, but they keep coming back day after day. \n Right now I don't want to break up with her , as almost all the problems are in my mind, and I believe that the girl I like will come back soon. If not, I will do what's best for me. For now, I know tons of people have been in my shoes, can I get some advice on how to cope and control my mind better? Thank you!

After consulting with two such supervisors who refused to take on the case due to Mother's behavior, we were referred to Current Supervisor (""CS"") who agreed. \n Problem : Current supervisor has supervised visits for one year. She has not maintained neutrality and has demonstrated clear bias in favor of Mother. She does not enforce the rules of visitation as delineated in the contract Mother and Father signed. She has accused Father of being ""hostile, cruel, slanderous, a threat to the emotional well-being of Mother and children."" She made it clear she intends to move Mother towards unsupervised visits and partial custody. By court order, Current Supervisor is responsible for verifying that Mother is obtaining court ordered therapy and psychiatric care. Care only sporadically attended; CS overlooks this. CS denies Mother's drug use, as she has ""never witnessed"" it, despite a drug test in August 2012 that was positive for prescription drugs.  CS allows mother to engage in activities that, in the past, were abusive to the children. CS has ""lowered"" supervision level and now allows mother to be alone with children in another room. CS has advised Mother to volunteer at older boy's school, despite the civil R.O. that prohibits this. Mother is attempting to do this. (Civil R.O. expires in April.) \n Partner recently retained a lawyer (via loan), who has no useful input on this subject. Lawyer contacted CS and Mother's attorney in order to meet and discuss the custody issues, CS refuses to meet as she ""can see no reason to do this."" Father's lawyer hopes to get Mother to agree to change supervisors, but it seems unlikely. Current Supervisor has no direct authority to whom she reports.  She is an independent contractor and works full-time as a Family Court Mediator in a neighboring county.  Family Court Services in our county has been contacted several times and refuses to help. Judge said he would not appoint an advocate for the child."	Therapeutic Supervisor is biased against custodial parent (Father). Negligent behavior, hostility, advising Mother to violate civil restraining order by going to child's school. Intends to help Mother get custody, thereby placing them in the care of a known drug addict with severe mental illness, who perpetrated domestic violence.  Who can Father report her to if she has no direct supervisor?	465	60	other
Grad school graduate here.  Like the BA, the most important part of going to graduate school is your ultimate employment goal (no one does this). \n MANY people, right now, are in graduate school for no reason.  They are avoiding getting a real job, or for some reason think they will be more qualified for.... something... if they have an MA/PhD.  The PhD market, by the way, is severely glutted in most fields.  In my field we have 150+ applicants for an associate professor opening (however working in academia is essentially the only thing that can be done with a doctorate in this field). \n So my advice is that before you waste 3-5 years in a program have an explicit and precise goal, actually  find jobs right now that you would be qualified for and would enjoy and would pay what you would expect after 9 years of education.   I could not tell you how many people quit grad programs because they find out the median pay in their field is $40k.  You could do that in sales with a BA in anything. \n As for your PI: that's pretty typical.  They're dicks and treat assistants (and even post-grads) like dirt.  They're all just sitting on the gravy train hoping no one ever realizes that US academia (and to a large extent research science) is a load of horse shit.	Goals!  Grad school may not fit your real goals and that does not make you a failure.	228	17	other
Early last year I went from a state mailroom job to a wireless phone tech support agent. That might be one of the larger mistakes that I've made in recent memory. The job's benefits are surprisingly good. But I burn through most of my paid time off on mental health days (I took one today). \n Multiple times a day I'm screamed and cursed at for problems that other agents have created or situations that I literally cannot solve (no same day delivery, no free phones, can't improve cell coverage and even if the account credit is warranted it probably won't be approved). But I have to keep a pleasant tone demeanor so that the failed survey that's soon to follow the call can possibly be challenged. I have 30-60 seconds between calls and I'm expected to modify customer accounts and do other tasks during that short period of time. Due to the slowness of the system that is impossible so I do those tasks during my breaks and lunch. I feel like I'm terrible at my job but I somehow ended up in the top 10 tech agents in my center. In my opinion the job is hell. \n I say all of that to ask will I be putting myself in a worse position by taking a contract IT position? I'm hoping to get a desktop support or field technician job. I know that my prospects are limited by only having a one computer certification and I'm only just getting started on my BS. But I feel that I will blow a gasket if I stay at my current job. \n How bad of an idea is it to leave a permanent job for a contract one?	I have a hellish call center job and I want to leave so badly that I'm thinking about taking a contract position.	286	22	other
"I moved to the West Coast from a foreign country. My home country isn't bad at all - I believe it's one of the richest countries in Asia - but I must say that the US really doesn't get enough credit for how fantastic its people are. \n Almost everyone I've met here have been polite, friendly, and open-minded (or at least courteous enough to not pass rude remarks out loud). \n There seems to be a strong culture of ""you can do whatever you want as long as you're not harming someone else"" here. I really enjoy that kind of general attitude. I've broadened my mind for sure, and I've become acquainted with people I'd never have befriended otherwise had I stayed in my home country. \n Yes, the US has its own set of flaws, but which country doesn't? Still, let's not discount the good things about the country."	I love you 'Murica.	148	4	other
"Obligatory: ""First post; sorry if bad formatting."" \n I am new at a school technically; it's my first year here.  The school is small, in fact, everyone who goes to that school grew up together.  That means that dating is a big 'no' unless you're an outsider, like me!  :) \n So there is this girl (let's call her Mindy).  At the start of the year, dumb ol' me was into Mindy's friend-- needless to say, that never worked out.  So, roughly Halloween, my school was doing some sort of carnival thing where I was required to help out at (like running booths, ticket managing, etc.).  The clown I am purchased a horse-head mask and pranced around the school like a fool while wearing it.   Sigh   Porbably my biggest mistake lol.  Mindy saw me doing it and got annoyed.  :P  Later on, I sorta IDK apologized for it I guess, and she said, ""Wow, I can't even believe you remember my name!""  Or somethin' similar to that. \n Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I was walking down the hall and Mindy and her friend bumped into me.  I swear for a good 5-10 seconds Mindy stared right into my eyes and didn't move!  That was the beginning!  xD \n After that, I catch her staring at me everywhere!  Mindy is one grade lower than me, so I can't exactly see her often, but when I do, it was really magical. \n HERE IS THE BIG THING:  One day in Health Class, Mindy's friend said aloud, ""I have a friend who is really 'boy-crazy' right now.   whispers   It's Mindy.""  :O  So I check the chart of everyone who is in Mindy's grade.  There are 2 boys in Mindy's grade, but one is nerdy and the other is a chubby slob.  There is another dude in MY grade, but I know for a fact that Mindy hates this guy.  The logical option is me of course.  xD  Or at least that is what you'd think. \n So confidence strikes me and I start making conversation with this girl.  Usually it's just a 'Hi', 'Bye' situation.  :(  I sent her a friend request on Facebook and she accepted literally as soon as she could.  In fact, she even messaged me right away, but it was short because she didn't have wi-fi and was using data. \n Fast forward to recently...  :(  She doesn't look at me anymore.  None of that.  I sent her a message asking her about Finals at 5:44 PM and I got was the dreaded ""Seen at 11:07 PM.""  On one hand I say 'Well, it was late and it was a bad idea for her to message me that late', on the other hand I say 'Why no she respond!?'  In fact, recently I've noticed her whole attitude has changed around me.  Also, I have a music gig to play at during a basketball game on Thurs.  She'll more than likely be there. \n WHAT DO I DO, REDDIT? \n EDIT:"	A girl showed interest in me, so I showed interest back.  Now she doesn't notice me. \n UPDATE:  I messaged the girl, but she only replied with poopy 1 word messages.  :/  Also, she avoided me today...  Reddit, why am I a lady-repellant???	495	42	other
"Hi, everyone. I've been a lurker here for awhile, and this is my first actual post. \n Throughout high school and my first years of college. I've acquired several pieces which I would consider falling into the category of preppy or traditional. I'm not in a fraternity or Ivy League university, and preppy style has been my personal choice. Today, a friend said upon seeing me, ""Well, you look preppy today."" \n My wardrobe consists of a LOT of Ralph Lauren OCBDs, J. Crew pocket tees, and Charles Tyrwhitt dress shirts. I own a few pairs of Levi's 514s and a variety of chinos. For the feet, I have a few Allen Edmonds oxfords, loafers, drivers, and boat shoes. For the cherry on top, I even own two needlepoint belts and a Kiel James Patrick anchor bracelet. I am happy with how these items fit, and I've visited a tailor several times (shout-out to Gonzales Tailors in New Orleans). \n However, I've seen a lot of interesting outfits lately which I would assume fall into the category of modern/streetwear/etc (I'm not good at naming these things). The Rick Owens stuff is interesting as well. What kinds of pieces could best combine modern elements with a basic preppy/trad wardrobe?"

"It is quite heavy with theology.  The point I was trying to make is that you can't talk about this stuff in simple dialog.  It requires a lot of time, effort and work because when you interpret simple words such as ""believe"" as different depending on your point of view and context you can't say something like ""Christians must believe in the bible"" and have it be accurate, yet at the same time, given specific situations and usage of the word, it is completely accurate. \n So, yeah, I understand.  It is a lot of thinking, and if you're not in the mood to think I will not be offended if you don't read it.  As a matter of fact, if you don't want to think, don't read it because it is a little bit of a mind fuck and not exactly easy to follow at times.  As is the nature of theology in general."

I saw this on my way to a restaurant to meet a friend and at first I thought oh they are just having a reasonable argument. Then on my way back from Dinner I saw them again and it had escalated and they were now in the town square.

"I'm in my Sophomore year of college at a university currently living in the dorms. I have a good social life with tons of friends but I'm getting really overwhelmed with classes and other things. Last year went great and so did the beginning of this last semester but mid-way everything started to go downhill. I screwed up and had to withdraw from two courses and my other two weren't very good. I'm absolutely miserable with my classes and have been incredibly stressed out. I'm currently studying Business CIS but I don't even know if that's what I want to do, I liked my business classes initially but the thought of having more classes gives me really bad anxiety (I've never had any anxiety issues in my life.) I just know if I take any more classes I'm going to do terrible in them and kill my GPA even more, right now I'm at like a 2.6 or something awful. \n In mid-november I had the police called on my dorm due to marijuana-smell (had walked in after smoking past an RA), I'm a medical patient and it's nothing I haven't dealt with before but the school has now deemed me a ""problem resident"" and any RAs or police can just come in my room without knocking if they suspect it smells (I don't even smoke in the dorms, but tons of people in my side of the hall do and I get blamed now). It's happened twice from then until mid-december when break started even without smell because the RA's were just mistaken and I live in fear of constantly having people barging in my room which made the last few weeks even worse. It isn't that big of a deal but it really makes me feel insecure living there. I've filed complaints with the dean and such but I've pretty much been told it's my own fault and to deal with it. \n To make matters worse I just found out today that I've lost my on-campus IT job because I never re-applied for the winter semester which I had no idea I had to do. I was so caught up with finals and everything that I somehow missed the information on this. What kind of job even makes you re-apply for your own job that you've been working? So this next semester I'll be even more broke than I was the last... \n I'm down home for break right now where I have a full-time IT internship which I love doing and I couldn't be happier and I make decent money. The thought of spending another few months in classes and the dorms broke just sounds awful. My parents are highly against taking any time off and I haven't brought it up to them yet but I really think if I spent the next semester working down here it'll help me figure out what I want to do and get back into the mindset for college.\nI could even spend the next few months working on some IT certifications which I've been wanting to do for awhile but haven't had time, my job has a ton of resources and will even pay for any certs I want to get. \n I could really use some advice here. \n Thanks"	Burnt out from college and need time.	547	7	other
i dont think it has lost meaning, i dont consider them to be hip in any way, its just the cookie cutter they fit into. \n what i would consider fashion is wearing something with a combination of textures more so than colours or a standard colour palette. something when explained to you, you think, lol you are fucking retarded that will look stupid, and when it is pulled off well, you see others start to do it. \n id say a straight male wearing something femanine just because it goes with the outfit.

In fact, I'd be willing to bet more people put aside the political beliefs about the military when it comes to how to treat/honor our vets.

All right, there are two issues to be debated: 1) is it morally acceptable to deny access to the country? And 2) is it economically realistic to allow a low bar of entrance? \n The answer to both is no, and the simple fact is that you cannot allow every poverty striken person into the nation. We should focus on making things better in Mexico before making it easier for people to gain entrance, because honestly: if you've never been to a border town you will never believe what it is like. Most of the people live in poverty, doing small time crappy jobs because they can't do anything else. Their children (citizens in most cases though many undocumented due to the parents not going to/ being able to afford a doctor) go to public schools which are paid for by taxes their parents do not pay. \n At the same time you have the entire southern borders of Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico as war zones. Drug cartels have no trouble getting in and once in they use a mixture of immigrants with no other options and drug addicts to seize control if small towns. Each year there are massacres and you can't travel south farther than San Antonio without having checkpoints that you must stop at. Saying that unchecked immigration is the solution is incorrect, because Mexico is a third world country over run by crime with a small echelon of rich. This same culture follows the immigrants and the massive influx of people make jobs scarce. \n Your argument is based around an entirely moral standpoint and I agree with the sentimentality, but it is unrealistic to ignore the current economic realities of the nation. Immigration is such a big deal down here not because of race, but because of the impact that it has on the economy and crime level. Whether this could be fixed via harsher laws or more lenient laws is not something I am entirely sure of, but I am confident that, were Mexico more stable and the majority of immigrants legal, the problem would be almost completely gone. \n I'm on my phone right now, so I don't know if this came across as I meant it, and I apologize for any grammatical errors.	Illegal immigrants destroy the area into which they move, bringing crime and economic instability. Serious reforms to the current laws must be made and we must try to bring some semblance of stability to Mexico.	378	35	other

We both shared similar music tastes and consequently, we began to talk. Eventually, we were talking every single day through apps like Kik or Skype. At the time, I was 13 years old and he was 12 (very young, I know). I was then being homeschooled and I was desperately lonely as well as significantly depressed. I needed friends and the internet was the only place I could get them, as my family sheltered me. He became my best friend. I told him everything about myself, my family, my secrets, etc. He did the same. We live in different countries, more than halfway across the world from each other, but we were inseparable. In 2013, I quit homeschooling and went back to public school. In 2014, we admitted we had deeper feelings for each other and began ""dating"" long distance. Things were great for the first year, we were each other's first significant other and we made each other incredibly happy, despite the distance. \nAfter about a year of ""dating,"" I became unhappy again. We constantly fought and we began to grow apart. He felt as if I no longer needed him because of my new friends from public school. I felt like he never tried for me anymore. After one particularly nasty fight, a guy  friend  of mine (that I had met online as well) tried to comfort me. He asked me to send him nudes and I did. However, my face was NOT showing and I was wearing a bra and underwear in them. Immediately after it happened, I felt horrible. I told Caleb right away and apologized tremendously. He viewed what I did as ""cheating."" We fought for the next five months about it, constantly breaking up and getting back together until eventually, we ended it for good. \nAfter we broke up, Caleb went and supposedly lost his virginity to another girl. He sent me pictures of his hickies and it hurt me deeply. I lied about sexual experiences that I've had to get back at him. We stopped talking after that despite the fact that I tried SO hard to maintain some type of relationship with him. \n I have a new boyfriend now (who I did not meet online) and I've moved on. The last time Caleb and I spoke, he supposedly moved on as well. However, Caleb and I knew each other for four years, he was my best friend and we basically grew up together.

Afternoon everyone, I'm 18 years old and I still haven't gotten a drivers license or a job. I've realized that I don't have any  responsibilities because of this. I want to drive and I want to get money so I can help myself and my family pay for my education. The problem is... I have a fear of screwing up. I also want to mention that it's not a fear of failure. Failure would be trying your hardest to do something and being unsuccessful. I'm okay with failure. \n What I mean by screwing up is accidentally causing harm/damage to something or someone. Why don't I want to drive? Because I honestly feel I would be a hazard on the road and might get some people hurt or killed. Why don't I want a job? Because I might destroy some valuable equipment or harm a co-worker. \n This is something I've been dealing with for awhile ever since the age of 15/16. The transitional period between childhood and adulthood. I avoided these responsibilities, and now I feel sort of worthless. \n How do I get past this fear? What can I do about it?

"You know, the first time I felt old was actually the 10 year anniversary release of Toy Story. It came out when I was still kind of a kid--I was about 12.

I should start out by saying I feel like I did the right thing, but its becoming increasingly difficult for me to justify it. A little bit of background on this: I moved from Michigan to Colorado in 2011, things were ok, I missed my family, but I managed to find a job out there. My wife whom I had known for 10 years (we worked at the same place in high school) had moved out there, and we had kindled a little relationship that was really awesome. We decided to wait and get married in June 2012. \n Things were going pretty awesome for us for a while, until May 2012 rolled around then shit hit the fan. We rented a little home in a canyon about 30 mins outside of Denver, it was cheap by the rent standards in Denver of course, but the landlord was a huge dick, and kicked us out for helping him improve the property, so we quickly had to find a house to rent. The options were pretty slim, with all of the people that move out there on a consistent basis the rents are high no matter where you go. So we rent a house for $1500 a month. We have two australian cattle dogs that definitely need a backyard to romp around in. My wife is working, we can afford the bills and have some going out money, so I think we are good to go. \n Fast forward to August I lose my job, we are now married, and we also have a baby on the way. I spend most of the last half of the year going through interviews for positions. I am in IT and the market is really competitive out there. If you don't fit a mold they don't want you.  I go on about 20 to 30 interviews, and nothing seems to be going my way.  So I get the money for a plane ticket to Detroit and come back for an interview with a huge automotive supplier in December, I immediately get offered the position. My wife is pretty upset, but her mother says that she's going to go out to Colorado and help her out. My wife still has her job and wants to wait til we have the money to move her back to Michigan (she's originally from here too). \n Its been hard to say the least on both of us. She doesn't get along with her Mom at all and her Mom isn't the best caretaker, she's the type that will throw money at a problem to let someone else handle it. I have been in Michigan, trying to get caught up on my bills. Almost 6 months of unemployment put me in a real bad way and I have been trying to go see my wife whenever I get the money and the chance. Yes my job pays pretty well, but I am still behind. My wife has been distancing herself from me due to the fact that she doesn't want to get hurt, and her already OAG nature has gone full force since the hormones have started kicking in.  She's on the verge of losing her job, due to performance issues, one of our dogs is sick, and she's convinced that I can't support us, nor will we have the money to move when the time comes. \n What do you do? I mean if you are in this position, what are you supposed to do? Am I doing the right thing?

Your girlfriend is 22, and you haven't mentioned any developmental deficiencies, so I assume she's OK. \n Like a lot of things I see in /r/legaladvice it's really a relationship/psychology question. \n She needs to have a talk with her dad, and keep talking until she understands why he's doing what he's doing, and what exactly he's doing. \n I'm not a lawyer, but I'd be concerned about IRS interest in possible tax evasion and in shifting of liability in case of injury at the house. If he's had her sign random documents she didn't read, she may be liable for loans or other stuff too.	ELI5, daddy.	103	2	other
Hello My ex boyfriend of one year broke up with me out of the blue and I'm don't understand his reasoning or thought process. (we are in our mid 20's)\nAbout two months ago my ex moved for a job to a different state that is 8 hours away. I was planning on moving down there after I graduate this semester. I have always been very supportive of everything that he does. I am currently student teaching while working two jobs so its been crazy for both of us but I wasn't worried. We still talked daily and called each other when we could. He even drove back two or three times to see me and his friends and family. This is his first time on his own. \n A few weeks ago he broke up with me on the phone. His reasons: his family apparently does not like me. According to them I have made rude or backhanded comments. No one has said, 'Hey, that actually hurt my feelings.' If they had I would have apologized! I honestly am a very kind person. However, to give you some back ground the family I grew up are incredibly rude and aren't friendly people. I have done my best to break away from my family's poisonous attitude. \n Second reason: We were moving too fast. However this falls on him some. He was the one pushing the engagement and living together and I was falling along with it. I knew it was a little fast but he really wanted it and I did also. I figured once we were engaged he would see we would have to slow down and it would be a long engagement. \n Third: According to him I can be hotheaded, stubborn and lack empathy. Which I agree with however, since we started dating, all those problems have lessen (back ground knowledge, my last relationship was horrible and I built up some walls). Also, those problems listed, he struggles with them also. And we have both worked on them. \n Fourth: the past few weeks before breaking up with me he mentioned that sometimes he wouldn't think of me or miss me and other times he would be sooo excited to come home and see me. He also compared me to some other girl down there and asked himself why his girlfriend could not be more happy. Which hurt. I am a happy person however my last semester is very stressful and it's I don't have time (or money) to be social or time for myself. \n I don't know what to do. I'm worried his family has a lot of sway of what he says or does. I'm worried that he won't be able to make his own decision that he will listen to them. I am also worried that he is not as mature as I thought he was and I'm worried he's not ready for engagement or to even take me back. He plans on talking to me next week to discuss our relationship and see if its fixable to even get back together. We have done the no contact rule for about two weeks now. \n Any advice would be useful. All the reasons listed above are able to be fixed! He just...gave up I guess.

I don't think things are going too badly so far. Honestly, when my girlfriend and I started dating, it took her a while to feel comfortable dancing with me out at clubs, even with the kissing and the staying over; she seemed more comfortable just dancing with her girlfriends and occasionally me for a little bit at a time. Even now she doesn't get like freaky or anything; not everyone's into that. \n > she texted me saying she was sorry she was boring, that she felt shy when I was there. \n Honestly, I'd take this at face value, especially if she's apologizing for something minor like that. \n Texting can be slow. Sometimes people don't get messages right away, or forget their notifications, or they're busy when they get them. Long as she's still texting, frequency isn't a huge issue. As for turning her down, there's nothing she can do about that, so maybe she just took the pragmatic approach and accepted it without guilting you about it.	you're still in good shape.

Hey guys. I know I just asked another question this morning, but I have a second hypothetical... \n I make minimum wage plus tips. The owners play this out as being generous to us. So we collect tips, and they disperse it to us through our bi-weekly paychecks. \n I put in my two weeks notice after a very tense discussion with my boss, and I'm wondering... if he collects tips from customers, is he obligated to disperse them to workers, or is he allowed to say fuck you to someone he doesn't like, and exclude them from receiving any tips on their last paycheck?

"Just moved out 3 weeks ago after living in a rental for 5 years. Landlord is now claiming damages of $1500 against our $1000 deposit and threatening to sue for the damages. The damage was caused by our dog. I do not disagree with the claims of damage but rather the amounts being estimated for the repairs. For example, $36 for window pins + installation and $140 for 4 sets of shitty mini blinds. $650 to repair dog scratches to ""vintage"" wooden doors to match the patina. \n In addition my landlord has stated in that the costs are merely estimates and that she will adjust (ask for additional money) as actual receipts come in. MI law only states that an itemized list of damages needs to be sent to the tenant within 30 days and that I must respond with agreement or disagreement within 7; there is no discussion of landlord rights to adjust for damages past 30 days. Can she keep coming after me for more money as estimates turn to receipts? \n I totally have the money and would almost just rather pay her to get it over with. But I just can't bring myself to do it without fighting a little bit after she sent a very passive aggressive letter along with the list of damages. \n Thank you for your help!"	landlord wants to collect for damages on estimates and the estimates are too damn high	223	15	other
A little background:\nI've been dealing with depression for several years and recently moved from my parents basement in Colorado to Chicago. Lately I've been really interested in physiology and I often find myself jumping from page to page on Wikipedia learning about different chemicals and anatomical functions and whatnot. One day I somehow stumbled onto MS and found (as I often do) that many of the symptoms coincided with things I experience. I am fully aware of my hypochondriac tendencies, but one symptom that really stood out to me was the MS Hug. It perfectly described the pain I was plagued by when I was about 12 or 13 and still experience infrequently to this day (I'm 22 now). The further I dug into MS the more plausible it seemed to me. Now it's gotten to the point where I am essentially convinced I have it and can't stop thinking about it. I feel my depression and anxiety returning and I really just want to put it to rest. \n Unfortunately, right before I moved I got crappy Colorado medicaid which they don't accept here in Chicago. I have a job that provides healthcare but I won't be eligible for it until September. I know I should wait and I'm just being crazy but the possibility of having MS is killing me. I'm definitely going to start therapy (for my depression) come September, but I want to see a neurologist ASAP. I'm just worried that I might not even make it until September at the rate it's affecting me. Yesterday I broke down crying out of no where and hid in the bathroom on a different floor so that I could bawl my eyes out. I've lost a job before due to my depression and I don't want to lose this one. \n What should I do? I'm really terrible at taking care of myself. Also if you have any experience with MS what do you think? I'll post a comment detailing why I think I have it and the symptoms I have.	I'm driving myself crazy because I think I have MS. I can't confirm or deny it because I have no insurance. What do?	342	23	other
"I can't help but feel that it's a lot of assumptions from someone very distanced from the circumstances, and that if I was in a similar position I would be very suspicious of anything that portrayed poor people as ""just lazy"". \n I believe you may also be doing one of the fatal mistakes of looking at poorer people as ""you, but poorer"" - they do not have the education, time and knowledge that you have. They cannot do ""the things you would do in their position"", because they do not know of them. They cannot bring a lawsuit if someone steals from them or treats them unfairly, because such things cost money and time, and often they are extremely short on both. \n And by what I've seen so far, the US system makes it VERY likely to put things outside your control. The 8000/year is about $650 a month, which will be mostly eaten by rent in many places, not to speak of  electricity, heating, food and insurance. \n Also used to think ""why don't they just"" about a lot of things regarding poor people, then actually met some and talked with them and discovered that there often are a bunch of reasons why they can't ""just"" do things like change house (such things cost money and you would probably lose your job), ""just"" change jobs (some state reports say there are hundreds if not thousands of applications for even entry-level jobs and they often require multi-year experience, not to speak of ruthless business tactics where they are not allowed to do things like NOT working a shit-ton of overtime for free, raise complaints, unionize or report abuses), ""just"" get a bike and bike to the ""hundreds"" of  available  (that part is important) minimum wage jobs nearby or ""just"" be more careful with their economy. \n It's important to remember that an anecdote does not make a set of data, and I have suspicions of special circumstances for your friend who does not appear to be paying bills over 600$ if not more - making me question how inflated it could possibly be. \n There's also the point that minimum wage is closely related to good results in general - virtually all states with high minimum wages do better than ones with the federal minimum wage. Even if it was laziness, it's unquestionably true that higher minimum wages are deeply correlated by a better economy in general."

I am currently 32 years old, raised in Canada, living and working in the United States.  I am making approx $85000 US + bonus in an IT gig that I'm not particularly passionate about, but I've become very experienced and knowledgeable in when it comes to my company in particular.  I should be happy with this, but I am starting to hit walls in my corporate career at this company. \n The reason for this is that I dropped out of university.   If I really wanted to move ahead in my company I would need to go back to grad school and I simply cannot do that because I don't have an undergraduate. \n I went to university for a number of things... Psychology, Comp Sci, Communications... but did not settle on anything and my lack of interest and general lack of discipline at that age led to me not completing my degree and leaving university without graduating. \n I still put that I have a university degree on my resume.  People rarely verify this information it seems, but I know at some point a company I apply to work for would do their due diligence and deny me a job or fire me.  If I don't put that I have a degree, I'm unlikely to get the interview. That's the reality, regardless of my experience. \n I hide all of this from most friends and family, though my immediate family are well aware.  I haven't told girlfriends in the past.  Many co-workers believe that I've graduated university, as I'm embarrassed to say otherwise. It's kind of a huge weight that I walk around with. \n I don't like the idea of going back to university so I've considered attempting to complete my degree online, but I have no idea where to go or how the process of transferring credits can work, especially with me working in the US right now.   I also am not sure what I should go back to school for.  I was working towards a Communications degree, so should I just finish that or should I put my credits towards a general arts degree?  That would be the fastest way for me to complete my degree, as opposed to starting fresh in something I'm more passionate about. \n I'm confused.  I'm sorry if I'm all over the place.  Just typing all of this out feels good. \n Some advice from someone who has had experience in this area or a has been in a similar situation would be great.

"Given that the rightwing Christian aspect of SB has been up front for a while (holy COW, just check out how many owner vids on Youtube include a bible in the EDC), it seems that most of the backlash is just backlash for backlash's sake. I don't even think the leather change (see below) explains this much weird hipster rage. What I see on Reddit is mostly just sniping about ""lesser quality,"" but with no actual explanation as to what, exactly, is objectively worse. \n Now, about the leather thing: In the Before, SB was like most other leather good manufacturers in that they discarded portions of the hide with obvious visual imperfections like brands, scars, etc. The assertion that I haven't seen refuted is that these imperfections don't impact the actual strength and durability of the leather; they're just aesthetic issues. \n SB has recently announced they'll stop discarding those portions of the hide, since they ""tell a story"" or whatever. As SB's whole image is ""super-rugged bags suitable for people whose professional lives make Indiana Jones look like a pansy,"" this seems like a reasonable position to me. I'm sure SB has been under pressure to meet demand, so increased efficiency is desirable. Wasting less material should help them, and is preferable to steps that would actually screw up quality at a fundamental level, which I've seen happen as small companies try to accommodate increased demand. \n By the way, the site notes that not all bags get the imperfections, and that some finishes end up with almost none b/c in their judgement they don't look as good in that color, or they just don't show as much, so it's absolutely still possible to buy a bag without a giant brand or scar; see: \n >Not all cows live hard lives and so not all hides have a lot of scars. If you order Carbon or Coffee, the thin or small scars won\u2019t stand out much. They show up nicely on Tobacco though. People who like the Chestnut color (red/brown) seem to like more perfect leather and we\u2019re very aware of that. It\u2019s not right or wrong; just a preference. Generally, we cut the big scars out of the chestnut leather, but there will always be a few here and there.

EMT here. You are NOT stupid or fucked up for having panic attacks. Panic attacks are real, organic events to happen to people whether or not they have anxiety issues. Anybody and everybody can have a panic attack if they get overwhelmed. \n That being said, recurring panic attacks over simple things combined with unusual, seeming unmotivated anxiety CAN be a sign that someone may be suffering from an anxiety disorder, depression, or other mental illnesses, which does not say ANYTHING about the other person except that they have a medical issue. I would recommend that anybody who might feel that they truly resonant with something like this seek advice from a medical professional. \n Having panic or anxiety issues doesn't make somebody a bad or a good person. It says nothing about the nature identity of a person except that they might have a medical issue, nothing more, and having one is completely OK. No one can a blame a person for having a medical problem.	Having anxiety issues doesn't make anybody good or bad or wrong or right, but if it's a pervasive problem in a person's lifetime, it might be a good idea to talk to a medical professional about it.	165	37	other

"Over the past week, I have met two women who are very different but who I both like quite a bit. I've now gone out with each and have plans to see them each again this coming weekend. One of them (N) will be a second date; the other, (C), will be a third. C and I had sex after our second date and she is going out of town for two weeks soon. I don't necessarily expect anything physical with N, but it's possible. \n Since both ""relationships"" are brand new, I don't feel like I'm leading anyone on or cheating or being a player. It makes sense that I would want to meet different kinds of women and see who I feel the best mutual connection with. While I know that bringing sex into the situation complicates things, I am more concerned that I currently feel like each woman really compliments certain parts of my personality that the other, so far, hasn't. \n Keeping in mind that either one of these could show a new side that makes my choice obvious or that either (or both) could decide they are not interested in dating me... how long does it seem reasonable for me to continue to see both of them? I would like to keep seeing N while C is out of town, but I'm also disappointed that it'll be two weeks without the chance to see C again. \n Other posts I've read/people I've talked to have discussed the obvious need to be honest, especially if I end up being sexual with both (and, it goes without saying, practicing safe sex).

I love this stock answer I've been saving: \n \n Two things mainly. They are very popular because of a large online following and the structure of their business model which keeps costs down also means they have small amounts of clothing in stock compared to competitor brands. \n > Uniqlo's parent company,  Fast Retailing , is Japan's biggest clothing company, with sales of $9 billion forecast this year. \n .... \n > Fast Retailing is still smaller than its global peers. Its revenue is around two-thirds that of America's Gap, Sweden's Hennes & Mauritz (H&M) and Spain's Inditex, which runs the Zara chain. \n .... \n > ...Fast Retailing also has a distinctive business model. Zara and H&M bring the latest fashions to the masses quickly, ordering new lines many times a year.  Fast Retailing, by contrast, sells only around 1,000 items, far fewer than its rivals , and keeps them on the shelves longer. \u201cWe don't want to chase after \u2018fast-fashion' trends,\u201d explains Mr Yanai. This lets Fast Retailing strike lower-priced, higher-volume deals with suppliers (most products cost $10-20) and makes managing inventory a much simpler and cheaper affair. \n Source: [Economist online article, 2010]( \n Additionally with the comparatively lower number of garments produced to keep the costs down further Uniqlo gets clothing made in the same factories as it's competitors. But in the off-season period or when the production of it's competitors cease. This means lower costs which are passed onto the consumer, but of course it means a delayed production and shipping cycle.

Actually, the RIAA has backed off of suing individual downloaders recently.

Instead, they're now focusing on shutting down sites, like the Megaupload case.	It's actually less scary now if you're so inclined to download music illegally.

Ok. Going to try and take the non snobbish way to explain this one, just so you understand why they are shit.\nThe big 3, miller, colors and Budweiser, are behemoths in the market, as a craft beer store owner, we see the antiquated laws and regulations that were put in to place after prohibition only help big beer because they are the larger distributors and control the market and Libby like megafucks to keep the ever increasing share of the craft seen at a minimum.  It's just scumbaggery to the max.  That all aside, they're beers are made with terrible ingredients to cut costs down and are generally not good pilsners.  People love them because it's what we start out drinking because it's heavily available, it's what was in our dads fridge and it's what we were able to pallet the easiest.  Imagine trying to get down a porter or stout as your first beer, or funneling that same beer at a tailgate.  Don't think so.  It is more for enjoyment. \nSomebody said the ABV doesn't matter, completely wrong.  It's like saying vodka and bud light are the same if you drink the same volume, they're not. \n So enjoy your bud light or miller, I still drink them when I'm out tailgating all day, but I recommend a good session ale or even a Pilsner from a decent smaller brewery, they aren't as common because they aren't rich in flavor profile, but it's better to buy local and help your own community than help out the juggernauts in this unfair fight.

This entire summer has been very rough for me (20male). My summer job has been employed by numerous rude thirty to forty year olds, my group of friends that has been very close for nearly five years is breaking up and my girlfriend and I (of over 2 years) broke up very early on into the season. \n Yet somehow between the midst of all this, I find myself happy most nights. \n I work at Lowes during my breaks from school, and can't stand it for the most part. And it may sound a bit ridiculous, but this new girl (20female) works in a department next to mine and just talking to her for minutes leaves me with a smile for days. \n I would consider myself fairly nerdy and really into art. I'm very tame and live somewhat of a boring life but I have many interests and dreams. One thing about me is i've never really dated (or had any interest) in someone who was different than me. \n But the girl I work with is about as redneck as it gets. She talks to me about four wheeling until 3am, drinking every weekend in sandpits, and basically living recklessly. All behaviors I have no interests in myself, yet somehow love hearing her talk about them. \n She is the type of girl I normally never thought about. I don't think i'm better than people like that or anything, i'm just not like that myself. Although now I spend most of my time thinking about her and wishing I could do something to improve our relationship. \n All summer i've taken every chance i've gotten to talk to her. Whether it was taking my lunch minutes after I started my day, or staying on lunch for twice the amount of time we're given to hear stories about her flabongo. I've even been stoping by her department to offer help after being told not to from bosses. \n But unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. \n It's really messed up for me to think this much about her, and even go as far as to post this, all about a girl who is already in a relationship. I just wish I could tell her how much merely talking to her has made this summer okay for me. Although she'd be creeped about it. I'm only working for two more weeks before school starts up and i'm desperate to get her number or anything to let her know I feel!

"24M here. Don't listen to waterwaterh2o. Don't tell her how you feel. More specifically, don't tell her ""I have feelings for you."" That would put her on the spot and make her feel uncomfortable. She probably doesn't want to make a choice right there. Instead, build it up which sounds like you're already doing. Telling her that you have feelings would only work if you know 100% she is 100% into you. \n Instead of asking for a date, tell her ""Hey, I want to take you to this restaurant/pier/fair/whatever"" It shows that you're taking charge like a real man. Movie is a shitty date idea. The date should have you guys talking and doing stuff with each other. When you're talking and looking at her, don't give her  puppy love eyes. Give her the eye contact that you're communicating a hint of sexual desire. You want to be convey to her that you're partner-material, not ""nice guy/friend."" Don't look at her like you want to rape her though. \n I don't know where your relationship/friendship is at now but just in case, I'll mention this - be comfortable in your own skin and she'll be comfortable with you. If both of you guys are comfortable, then there's no awkwardness. Don't be afraid of silence. Embrace it. Don't feel like you guys need to blabber nonstop. \n One way where you can escalate things is while you guys are out walking, just grab and hold her hand and keep walking. Don't say anything about it. Continue whatever conversation. She wouldn't mention it if she's really comfortable with you. Or she might say ""what are you doing?"" If that happens, play it off like it's no big deal. Explain it to her while still holding her hand ""I just want to hold your hand."" \n Who_needs_College got it right as well but I disagree with the awkwardness part (see 3rd paragraph)."

I (29F) just started dating this new guy (30M) that I met online.  We had our first date a few days ago, but before that I had pretty much given up on us actually meeting because of how frustrating he is to communicate with over text.  To give context. When setting up the first date he's the one that said he wanted to go out with me. I asked him out for a specific day, and he said that wouldn't work, but the weekend should.  I follow up asking if a specific day on the weekend works, and I get no response.  Ok, fine.  I can date, and have been dating, other guys, and I'm not going to chase after this one. \n I hear nothing for over a week when he texts asking me out for that night.  I tell him I already have plans, but I suggest another day later in the week.  He asks me if it's another date, and since it was I wasn't going to lie and tell him that it is a date.  He asks me to meet him for a drink after that date, and I tell him that's not going to happen, but I'll go out later in the week.  I also tell him that he could have gone out with me earlier when I had asked, but he stopped responding, so he should have no problem being patient for me to be free.  He apologizes and says that he got sick and swamped with work.  We set up plans for the following week; I text to confirm, and we go out. \n The date itself was actually great, and we have a ton in common.  He expressed that he wants to see me again and referenced things we can do on the next date, but the horrible communication is starting again.  I texted him the other day to see how he was doing, and we talked a bit with him responding.  He again mentioned things we should do when we go out, so I asked him when he's free to plan the next date.  I got no response. \n I don't expect or need to talk everyday between dates.  And, I definitely don't want long texting conversations.  But, I'm frustrated that he will just stop responding when I ask a question like that.  I know with online dating he's likely dating others (so am I), but based on conversation we had on the first date I don't think that I'm just a placeholder to explain this behavior. \n Part of me wants to tell him next time he texts me that I don't like him ignoring a question and find it frustrating and as if he has no interest. But, another part of me wonders if that's me being too overbearing already and should just let it go.  I don't want to be seen as this demanding girl expecting responses and things from him already, but I don't want to be a pushover when it comes to expecting common courtesy. \n Do I even bother saying anything to him?  Or do I just see if/when he texts and asks me out and go from there?	Dating new guy that has bad habit of not answering questions on text regarding going out.  I'm finding it rude and want to say something. But not sure if I should let it go so I don't come across as demanding of things from him already.	529	46	other
Hey Reddit. \n Yesterday my roommates came home with a woman, her child and her dog, who are now crashing in the living room until she gets back on her feet. This wasn't discussed with me at all. \n We all had a house discussion and I was told that no matter the amount of time my rent won't be lowered. I currently pay 400 a month -- I also am not on a lease because one of my roommate's parents owns the home and refuses to write a lease because his federal benefits will be cut. Moving into this home cut my SSA to only 480 dollars. Go figure. Also I cannot obtain a job due to my equina. \n In addition, the woman has no job. She said the only compensation she can provide is cleaning the home and purchasing food with her EBT card -- 320 dollars a month. Currently she has no food stamps and doesn't receive them until the 8th of November. The only food in the home is what I've purchased within the last week -- of which the woman and her child invited themselves to. \n I discussed with my roommates, prior to not consume my food without asking. I also have stated to the strange lady to not consume the food either. I haven't made my rounds yet to assess if or what has been eaten today. \n The dog is another issue. I have a very small dog and her dog is perma kept outside because he's very aggressive. I'm unable to take my dog out on a leash due to my disability, however, this is now expected of me because it was clearly stated to me that my dog isn't allowed in the backyard until this lady's dog leaves. \n I expressed my concerns with rent -- in addition, my roommates are in debt and also have a baby. They're taking on the addition of a fully grown woman, a child and a dog. The entire reason I had moved in was to lessen their financial burden, and now I'm in a predicament where I have no money to even possibly find another roommate situation and its not like I want to either. They're good people but this is thus far the only hiccough I've experienced with them. \n I personally feel as if I had no say in anything. I expressed every concern I had and even said I don't trust the woman and I don't know her and I don't appreciate the massive amount of inconvenience and burden this puts on me. Stressed already about my personal financial situation, I can't help but also be stressed with added people in the house making the bills increase.	strange woman, her kid and dog moved in for indeterminate amount of time without consult.

"So here is the deal. I'll lay it out in pretty objective terms. I'm 18M she is 18. \n She broke up from a 3 yr relationship with a guy about 4 months ago. Over the last few months she and I have come to be much closer. But from the very start I was clear where I wanted this to go. There was never any doubt in her head about my feelings for her, and she returned the favor by being open with me. We have gone on a few dates, and talk on the phone most days, often spending hours on the phone. I enjoy her company, and she has stated that the enjoys spending time with me. She also has stated on multiple occasions recently that, and I quote, ""You are the person I feel most comfortable with."" \n Sounds like an awesome situation, right? Wrong. And I'll tell you why... \n I am a nice guy. Always been that way. Haven't pressured her, just been there, while making sure she knows I haven't lost interest. She continues to mention things like, ""oh, you haven't seen this movie? We'll watch it."" She keeps suggesting things we can do. Just in an offhand manner. \n Now, the issue. A former friend, who seems really genuine and nice, but is actually deep down, a dramatic person who has a history of drugs, and alcohol. (She is super against drugs/alcohol and that kind of stuff. I have no history of that) As well as the fact that he has some rather unsavory friends. And he got involved about a month ago. He just...made things complicated for her. ""Which guy do I choose."" \n So. Things are beginning to come to a head, and today I said to her, I am just really tired of this. This whole situation. And she responded with, essentially, ""me too."" She spent some time talking to the other guy today, and when I asked about it, she said they were just talking about stuff, not relationship things,  as friends . She gazed straight into my eyes as she said this. And later tonight we will work out the details for us hanging out tomorrow. \n So. Thoughts? And sorry for the wall of text."

"What a dope.  ""Living within your means"" assumes rational action by students. This is fine, assuming that they have access to reliable, accurate information.  They do not. \n Let's take a typical law student.  Law schools have been busted publishing outright fraudulent, misleading information about employment prospects and earning potential in an attempt to attract students.  [Source 1]( [see also Source 2](  They're claiming 95%+ employed at graduation rates without mentioning that they are employing almost 40% of their graduating classes in part-time positions for $15 an hour. [Source 3](  They then exclude the $15 / hr salary data from their ""median salary"" information and claim salaries in excess of $100k are common. \n The typical applicant sees this and thinks something along these lines: 95% of graduates are employed at graduation / 9 months.  The median salary is $100k.  It's safe to assume that I'll be employed at graduation.  I'll be safe and assume that I earn $75k / yr, far below the median.  I can totally afford to pay off the $XXX / mo student loan. \n The problem is that the median isn't $100k and 95% of graduates are not employed in legal jobs / jobs requiring education at graduation.  [Proof 4]( (note especially: ""Whittier, with annual tuition of about $39,000, reported that 17% of its 2011 graduates were in full-time long-term legal jobs nine months out, among the lowest in the nation. Forty-one percent of the school's graduates were unemployed and seeking jobs, the data show. \n Compare that to its class of 2010 figures in U.S. News & World Report's annual law-school rankings, which are widely followed. The school reported to the magazine that 85.5% of its 2010 grads were employed nine months after commencement and 4.3% were unemployed."") \n It's patently absurd to look beyond what is consumer fraud in any other industry and blame the consumer for not being rational when relying in good faith on fraudulent data. \n Finally, it makes zero sense to base recommendations on what  you think people did during spring break.  For all you know, those ""peers"" are back home visiting family / working at family businesses / or they can afford to go on vacation."	shut the fuck up.	362	4	other
One time, years back while I was unemployed, the Bank of Mom gave me a loan to buy some groceries. Upon arriving home and unloading my bounty and storing the grocery sacks for later use as bin liners I realized my precious cheese slices were nowhere to be found. I called the Bank to inquire as to whether I simply left them in her vehicle, or if they had never actually made it out of the store. While they weren't with her they were listed on the receipt. As I was determined to enjoy the processed cheese stuffs I had paid for I went back to the store and demanded satisfaction. After a brief conversation with customer service I was given free reign to select a new package of cheese. Several days later while retrieving one of my saved grocery sacks to replace the liner in the bathroom waste basket I find a lonely, room temperature package of sliced cheese. I had absent mindedly abandoned, and quickly replaced my cheese friends, thinking only of my own selfish hunger.	Lost my cheese, got new cheese, found old cheese.	178	9	other

"Honestly, as someone who has been clinically diagnosed with depression for 10 years, getting past it and coming out a new person. Looking back I feel it wasn't a real thing either in the way most of humanity takes it. I feel like it's more of a brought on thing by your own interaction with life than a ""disease"" one suffers from. The state I was in was brought in by my reaction to multiple stimulus that constantly left me feeling like I had a ball of death in my chest always and a never ending emotional pain that severely crippled my day to day existence. \n After self medicating and having multiple self therapy sessions using LSD and Mushrooms I have conquered the humps that depression put into my face and realized it wasn't something I was ""born"" with but it was more of an affliction brought on by my mind and nothing more and getting past it was something that required me to really sort through myself and my very day to day life. I never took anti-depressants and constantly felt like I was withering away to nothing, but I saw what the pills did to my other friends and I just felt like feeling shitty was better than being medicated like that but since my self medication the feeling has not returned since my month long session. \n If you're interested in details feel free to message me, it's a bit of a personal experience I don't feel like writing out here but I'd be happy to share in private."

"I am a 27 F and also just getting back into dating after getting out of a long-term relationship a few months ago, too!! \n I would be considered ""post-university"" too, but I don't live in a big city. \n I was also raised in a more traditional culture, and for me, sex and love are inextricably intertwined. That's just the way I am. I don't think your expectations are unrealistic, and I've learned that the only way to go through life is to be happy and confident in yourself, to know who you are and what you want from life. For me, I've experienced a happy, loving relationship where sex and love was present, and I know I want that again. It helps to know why you are dating, so that you can weed out the kind of partner you don't want, from the kind of partner you do want. For example, the reason why I'm dating is to find love.

Humans aren't robots.  We aren't practical beings who strive for practicality.  We have vast cultures and differences that should be studied and known.  We should know how we as a society came to be.  History and literature are a facet for that.  Without history, we would forget everything that humanity has strove for, paid for.  Without literature, we wouldn't have such great works as Shakespeare or some of the old epics such as the Iliad or the Odyssey. \n Doesn't matter if they're directly practical or not.  They give us a facet for shaping us into who we are.  They're indirectly useful and practical.  They give us a clue into how our culture came to be.  That's why they're important and should be taught in school.  Though I think physical activity should also be mandatory in schools too. \n Otherwise you end up with a bunch of people who have terrible grammar and don't know anything about the past except the most recent. \n Not teaching history would mean not teaching about the Founding Fathers, how nations were formed, how our political process came to be, and to an extent, why we need to defend our rights.  No one would know of George Washington, Alexander the Great, Abraham Lincoln, and etc.  We wouldn't be taught how WWII or WWI came about, about appeasement and the consequences of peace at any cost, we wouldn't be taught about the Holocaust or the Cold War and McCarthyism.  We wouldn't be taught of Mans' great achievements such as the Pyramids, the Great Wall, or Apollo 11 and what got us to the moon. You'd end up with a lot more ignorant people than we have today. \n And the thing about grammar; I'm guessing you came from a pretty well off school/area since you don't seem to have met many adults who have poor grammatical skills.  I'd make it a requirement in college if I could with the amount of people I meet who don't quite have a full grasp on grammar.

In order to get a passport you need both sole physical and legal custody.  Not just legal.  If you have physical and legal custody you won't have a problem.  I don't know what it would take, to get sole physical and legal custody, but I would imagine that the fact that she's completely abandoned him would hold weight.  It would be easiest and best to get this, because even if you somehow convinced her to sign off on the passport, you would then have to convince her to sign off every time you wanted to leave the country.  With official documents proving your situation you don't have to deal with any of that.  In the long run, it would be best. \n Note:  There is a form for special circumstances, in order to get a passport for a child without the permission of one parent.  This will likely not work in your situation.  I worked in passports for several years and handled thousands of applications.  I never saw a passport approved for a child if this form was used and the non-agreeing parent was alive and residing in the United States.  They will expect you to find her and receive her permission and will not issue the child a passport without that.  In the few cases where this form is approved generally the other parent has left the country and there is literally no way to find them, they're unreachable (like if they're in the military and deployed somewhere remote), or there's some sort of protective order.	If you want to get your abandoned child a passport, get sole PHYSICAL and LEGAL custody first.  It's the easiest and quickest way.	256	23	other

Hello, I am 28 and completely clueless when it comes to fashion, even more clueless when it comes to hair.  I read the sidebar on hairstyles, but it didn't seem to help me much. \n I have been shaving my head since I was 15 (mostly with clippers w/o attachment, but the last few years I just used a razor).  Since about the middle of October I decided it was time for a change and started growing out my hair.

I have actually received some compliments, which is not something I am used to at all, so that is a pretty good ego boost. \n At this point I feel really awkward with it, though.  It sometimes seems like it sticks straight out into some awful looking mini afro (especially right after a shower).  I feel like I should do something with it (like get it cut somehow), but if I went somewhere I wouldn't even know what to ask for.  Then again, maybe it is just going to look silly for a while until it grows out more. \n I was thinking of growing it out longer, so I could part it somehow... but really I have no idea what will look good.  So I am open to all suggestions, really. \n So, what do you think I should do?

"During the Reagan era, a huge amount of prisons were built while violent crimes actually were decreasing. The reason incarceration rates were still rising is because the U.S. government began criminalizing small-time possession of drug as well as other non-violent activities that were made ""crimes"" due to new laws being passed. \n Now, call me a conspiracy theorist but in my opinion there were a lot of people profiting from keeping incarceration rates up (higher occupancy in private prison = more profit for owner. Think of a hotel... low vacancy is ideal). This basically started a sort of prison industrial complex that criminalized certain crimes specific to certain demographics (i.e. small amounts of crack could lock someone up for awhile, while it took a significantly larger amount of cocaine by law to get locked up as long. The difference is low income minorities  tended  to use crack more than cocaine.) \n At this point, programs focusing on decarceration would be a much more useful approach considering we are locking up a hugely disproportionate amount of minorities and essentially ruining their lives' potentials. I just think too many people are profiting from the prisons that have been established already for us to turn back now. \n There are definitely sources on my claims, I just don't have time to look them up and I don't have my textbooks/notes with me from school that detail this subject. \n Source: I just finished taking a class in sociology that focused a whole unit on prisons and incarceration in the U.S. basically trying to answer your question."	we started targeting certain minorities to lock them up rather than trying to help those groups, which makes money for those running private prisons.

I appreciate you giving your further thoughts on this. Ty :) \n Why no sex? I definitely WAS interested (it had been a few weeks); and we'd both been bringing each other pretty close to orgasm. But... I wasn't totally ready. a) I prefer to only go 'all the way' if the communication  is  really on-point in all areas, and it's clear we've both got a pretty good level of trust in each other (even if it's just a casual thing). I personally need that shit to be totally comfortable- and hence to actually be the best lover/fuck-er I can be (lel). It felt like we both  liked  each other lots but still were building up to that baseline level of trust.

This is really really insensitive and a terrible thing to say. Most people who perform an act such as this have underlying mental health issues, that, if treated correctly, can be fixed with a few months of inpatient.

Or, I could call an ambulance and get him to the hospital, so, I did. He cooperated and came along just fine, we also found out about his family life (a lot of abuse), his self harm issues, his bulimia nervosa, and the fact that his girlfriend sexually assaulted him on a regular basis. This all came as a shock to me, I handed his firearm over to the police, didn't give a name or anything, and now.

Do you see a need for them?  Further German military do use American military bases/installations including on mainland America. \n Ramstein is probably the primary one you are thinking of.

It has military forces from the US, France, UK, German, Belgian, Polish, and a whole host of other NATO nations.  The US nearly fully foots the bill of base upkeep and maintance at the benefit of everyone including the Germans who also use the base.

This happened in New York (Long Island). \n In January my dad was pulling away from a pump at the gas station and accidentally tapped the bumper of the car in front of him.  The lady  comes out of her car screaming at my dad.  He gets out of the car and goes to her car and sees there\u2019s no damage.  He looks at his car and there\u2019s no damage.  The woman is quite angry and demands to see my dad\u2019s license and insurance.  My dad declines (our insurance has always told us to never give our info to anyone except law enforcement in the event of an accident) and tells here there\u2019s no damage but that he\u2019ll wait if she wants to call the police and report the accident.  So she calls and reports it then goes back to yelling at my dad. \n At this point my dad just decides to go back to his car and wait it out figuring it\u2019ll be a quick write up from the police.  So about 45 minutes goes by and no office has come yet.  In the mean time, the woman\u2019s been in and out of her car looking at her rear bumper and talking to someone on her cellphone.  My dad calls 911 again and asks if they have received a report of an accident and if police are on the way.  The dispatcher says a call was received but that it\u2019s low priority since there\u2019s no injury and police will get there as soon as possible. \n Another 30 minutes or so pass and finally an office arrives.  My dad and the woman both give the officer ID and insurance.  The officer goes over to the cars and wipes away the dirt/snow from her bumper and see\u2019s there\u2019s no damage.  He asks why we called police for this since there\u2019s no damage.  My dad replies that the woman was angry and he didn\u2019t want to leave the scene of an accident.  The officer quickly writes up the incident and sternly tells the woman that she\u2019s wasting everyone\u2019s time (not in those words).  My dad gets home and reports the accident to his insurance. \n Come April my dad gets a letter stating that the case has been closed since there was no damage to either vehicle and the other party had not filed any personal injury claims.  Thinking the issue\u2019s done with he forgets all about it.  Come the end of July, he gets a letter from the woman\u2019s attorney stating that my dad needs to contact his insurance company with regards to the accident and injuries caused to the woman.  So my dad sends out the letter to the insurance company and they tell him they\u2019ll take care of it and not to worry.  Well, come December my dad gets served with a summons.  The woman is claiming she was and still is dealing with injuries resulting from the accident. \n So my dad once again forwards the summons to his insurance and they have assigned a law firm to the case.  However, the insurance has also stated that we may want to get our own lawyer at our own expense incase the the judgement is for more than our insurance covers. \n Lawyers/Judges of reddit\u2026is this a frivolous lawsuit?

I'm sure someone is way more knowledgeable on the subject than I am, but here's what I've got. At my job, we ship ocean containers overseas into China, and to do so into certain areas...the red ones... you have to have a Chinese government employee come inspect what you are shipping, and make sure it's being loaded properly, has the right material, isn't freedom etc.etc.etc...So, I'm sure there is a little more to it, but I feel it's a pretty reliable source. The most reliable first hand source I have at least. \n Anyways, I was talking to the inspector one time about it, and his explanation was basically they have no laws on what factories are pumping out. In the USA you have to meet certain requirements as to the amount/strength/volatility of the byproduct coming off your smokestacks. China doesn't have these laws. That along with the massive population, and economy growth give you the glorious photos were you can't see more than a block away! \n I'm sure a lot of these companies have some political weight as well, so that may be a contributing factor since it's insanely expensive to build and install commercial grade air filtration systems.

"That reasoning is called social darwinism. It was a big deal in the late 19th and early 20th century. \n The basic principle was to roughly apply the concept of biological evolution to society. Thus concluding that there is only one culture, and all cultures all just different stages of the same culture, and, therefore, that some cultures were superior. \n This is pretty much what you are asserting here, that all religions follow the same route and undergo the same processes. \n Needless to say, this kind of reasoning, mostly based on popular ""common sense"" was refuted by social sciences many decades ago. Specially after humanity saw that it was the way of thinking that was behind colonialism, racism, eugenics, etc. \n I say, take a look at Edward Burnett Tylor's work if you want a further understanding of this. \n Today, we can say that there are no universal laws that apply to society. Every phenomenon is studied on its own and compared to orders if its required, but we no longer try to find rules that control everything in the way we find them in physics, for instance. \n This way of understanding social events on their own terms is greatly influenced by cultural relativism.

I grew up in a border town next to Mexico in Texas. When I was a senior I was ranked 13th out of over 500 high school seniors. There were not many white kids in my school.

Every single one they worked to get the applications for was for minorities only. While it felt unfair, I had already worked through most of high school. \n So I applied and received Pell Grants, government subsidized loans, and I worked usually 1 to 3 jobs at the same time. I graduated in 4.5 years and now over 10 years later make 6 figures. While I believe with hard work you can achieve your goals. There is no way I would have been as successful if it wasn't for the help of Uncle Sam.	Life isn't fair. Work your ass off with as much help as you can.	199	14	other

"Well ok, but that doesn't mean it still isn't a racial slur.  I'm not saying that individuals who use it are racist, just that people can't ""feign"" ignorance and pretend it's not an issue.  It's still perpetuating a systematic oppression of minorities.  When, say, Native Americans complain about these things we aren't saying ""You're all racist"" it's more like, stop pretending that this isn't a word with roots in racism and one that was designed to hurt and degrade individuals.  I usually say, imagine if there was a team called ""the Cleveland (N-word)'s"" people would go up in arms, and it's the same.  Even if it isn't the same word, that doesn't mean it's not racist.

I've got a 95 camaro i'm about to try and sell, but it definitely needs some work done before it can be sold for a good bit. \n My hood had a hole in the paint and water seeped under it, and caused it to peel away and rust a good bit. I know it's simple to repaint it, but I bought my car with a custom color, rather than a GM original color. \n Car also has fire damage on the drivers side door panel (long story) where the door panel is completely screwed up and window controls are and have been popping out of the door panel since. \n How much do you think these repairs will be, from your opinion?	hood is peeling custom paint, and door panel is screwed.

"He was an asshole and definitely not deserving of a thanks. I had been smoking a cigarette the first thing he told me was the car smelled like ""weed"". I laughed, told him I hadn't smoked pot in years. He asked if he could search the vehicle and I consented, then he declined to anyways. The field sobriety test took about 30 minutes, mostly me standing on the sidewalk while he chatted with another officer.

He then said ""You mean to tell me you really think you are not intoxicated?"" Again I said no, explained I had only had a few drinks after work (about a 90 minute time span). Then he showed me the PBT, .06. Told me I couldn't drive the car, not that I would be charged, and they couldn't tow it since it was legally parked.

A lot of butt hurt white people commenting about the pitfalls of affirmative action. Slavery might have been illegal for a while but the black communities are not the most conducive for a learning environment. I am not saying this was the case with OP but having to take care of your siblings while you are being raised by a single parent who is out at some minimum wage job and you have assignments due the next day are not really going to provide you with the best GPA. Also, I am surprised by the people who complain about college costs. Most schools, public or private actually do not charge you the full cost of your attendance. A large part of it is covered by returns from endowments and such. I went to a school that had a 50k plus cost per year but studies revealed that students paying the full cost were paying less than half their cost of attendance. Also, close to 80% of the students were on some form of financial aid, even those whose parents making 100k+ a year. You cannot expect to go through high school half assing your course work and expect to get to great colleges. And great colleges have a way of making your college experience affordable. I partied through high school, had my share of adventures and misadventures and was actually at a significant disadvantage to most people (even white folks) during the application process, but was serious about things that mattered and ended up at a pretty decent college.\nAlso, this is coming from a minority who is actually at a disadvantage when applying to top schools.

"So, my problem is quite simple to explain: the moment I have any romantic interest in someone and they return it in kind, I rather quickly develop an obsessive fear of them breaking up with me. \n While I'm talking or out with someone, it's not so bad; they're returning my interest in kind with their presence/attention and I'm assured. The moment we get off Skype or I drop them off at home, I become almost certain I did something to offend them and that that thing (usually something small like saying I'll ""probably"" meet them at a board game night) will lead to the ultimate demise of our slowly budding relationship. I'm doing so right now, actually, as I just feel absolutely certain the current (past?) budding relationship has been nipped, as it were. \n It's hurt me romantically already and continues to hurt me romantically today. At first I thought it was self-esteem because my first partner was what I felt then and believe now to be well out of my league. However, presently, the issue doesn't seem to be self-esteem so directly; I just feel like, deserving or not, he will break up with me and I really don't want that to happen, despite only knowing him for a few weeks and never even kissing or any of that fun stuff. \n After the first relationship ended (so, I was right, kind of (that was a joke)), I looked at how it affected me and hoped that, by taking things more slowly in future relationships and not building the other person up in my mind, I would avoid the issue again. Not so. It's just as strong now as it was then."	Pretty much the title.	282	4	other

"One year ago today, I was contacted by my city's drug task force. (I am in Colorado). A detective stated that he ""had a strong case against me for the distribution of a schedule one drug, and would like me to come chat"". I said sure, did not go into the DTF office, and lawyered up instead. The lawyer contacted the detective and tried to set up a meeting. The only info they would give her is that they said they have 2 distribution charges pending and 2 possession charges. She told me they typically double up on charges for leverage (selling two gram bags counts as two offenses). She told me they knew I was a small fish, and wanted me to become a CI. I said I would consider (in order to buy time to save money for a better legal defense), and we tried to meet the detectives for about six months (Jan.). When we finally met, they showed me a contract to consider. I told them I would let them know if I was willing in a few weeks. They threatened to file with the DA within two weeks. I came back and signed the contract within the two weeks. I fell out of contact after 3 months, and not having much success (unwilling to rat out people for a drug crime, more willing to come across someone breaking into houses or cars or assaulting a woman which happens a lot in my college town, they told me these would count towards the contract). It has now been five months since I was last in contact with them, and I received a text from the detective saying he is going to apply for a warrant tomorrow if I do not respond. \n I'm not sure what to think. Part of me thinks they are just fishing for a CI and do not have any hard evidence. I work for the government and they asked if I had my fingerprints on file which I found odd..and I told them I do. I am young (23), and would like to avoid getting a felony. I have parted ways with my lawyer after the CI meeting. I would love to know if this seems like a farce to convince me to narc on someone, or if they were just cold calling me from some kid who gave them my number when he/she was caught. I haven't dealt or been around illegal drugs in over a year, but there could be a chance I am guilty (without saying much), but if I was to be a guilty person, guilty me wouldn't sell over 3-6g's of a substance. I also think it is a bit odd to file for an arrest warrant after sitting on it for a year (I understand a few felonies is no big deal to them, and I would be of more value as a CI, but wouldn't the evidence go down somewhat in value?)"

"I work at a family owned hardware store in Chicago, and as such I see a lot of the same customers in once a week, once a month, twice a day, whatever.

This is a really big issue for me, as someone who has worked in retail for a big corporation and as someone whose parents own a small business. The whole ideal that the customer is always right is corporate spawned slogan aimed at coupon clipper moms who want to be treated right in their shopping experience. \n However, these same people expect this policy to be carried out universally across the business spectrum.

"This whole debate pops up every other month or so on reddit, and for some reason it always makes it pretty far along toward the front page. Having spent the better part of a decade waiting tables in the United States, here are some realities I think the OP and a large portion of commenters aren't exactly comfortable facing, when it comes down to it: \n 1) The extremely shaky definition of ""good"" and ""bad"" service. \n Did your waiter get everything right and provide you with refills, but just wasn't bubbly enough? Did they just not connect with you? Were they imposing on your private conversations? Every customer has a different expectation of what constitutes ""good"" service, and waiters aren't mind readers. \n 2) Very little of your experience is under the waiter's control. \n Did your steak get overcooked? Did the manager refuse to take it off the ticket? Is it too hot or too cold for you to be comfortable? Is there really no gluten-free menu item for your spouse on a fad-diet? The waiter is only able to control the accuracy of your order and the speed of your drink refills. Pretty much everything else is outside their control. \n 3) Tipping is standardized and accepted practice in the United States. \n Social customs and mores vary widely across cultures. If you live in or are visiting the United States, it is expected that you will tip your waiter in the 15-20% range, barring  extremely  bad service. This practice is so established in our society that we don't require waiters to be compensated with a minimum wage (more or less). If you feel that social customs and mores do not apply to you, because you have your own system of doing things, great. That makes you a sociopath (and also an asshole). \n 4) When you don't tip, or tip poorly, you're committing yourself to an extremely petty pyrrhic victory. \n Do you like this restaurant? Do you  ever  want to go back? If you don't, no problem. But if you do, you  will  be remembered. A customer who leaves a shitty tip, or no tip at all, will  not  be forgotten by the waiter, and that waiter points out to other waiters that you're a bad tipper, and those waiters will generally treat you like shit. \n Seriously... I can not emphasize this enough. You will never get good service at that restaurant again. It really doesn't matter whether it was justified or not, because waiters don't forgive that. And when you complain to a manager for that shitty service you're getting, they might apologize to you, but they already know you exist, and why you're being treated the way you are, and usually let it slide. Bad tippers are bad for business; as a manager, they piss off your wait staff and everybody suffers. \n Look, basically, you guys can do whatever you want. I'd guess 90-95% of tables tip in the 15-20% range, and the 1-2% of shitty tippers are evened out by the 2-5% who tip over 25%, and it really doesn't mess up most waiters' nights. But it hurts emotionally, and you better believe they will remember you, and make sure you're known to other waiters, the managers, sometimes even the cooks. Is this whole circle-jerk over 5% of your meal really worth it?"	If you're an asshole, you're gonna have a bad time.	553	10	other
"You're combining a few different evolutionary concepts in a poor way. The best hypothesis I have heard about why some male birds are so colorful is that it costs so much energy and is so dangerous to be colorful and have extra plumage that it shows females that a colorful male is healthy and able to avoid predation and therefore would be a good mate. Generally species that have female choice like that don't have ""dominate males"" who fight each other for females, simply because in that case the energy spent on making all the extra plumage or what have you is wasted. For example elk and deer both have mate selection based on male combat, not female choice, and males have no extra ornamentation beyond large antlers which are used in battles with other males for mates. \n In terms of early humans though most signs point to male combat/competition.

Although I agree. The reason is based in Congress and the Supreme Court. \nIf I recall correctly, there was a Supreme Court decision based on this very question.\nEssentially the Court held that, so long as woman are restricted from combat they should not be subject to the draft. Primarily because the draft is used to acquire soldiers to be placed in immediate combat. They did acknowledge that there are many other military positions that the draft fulfills but not nearly in substantial numbers are a draft would require. \n As Congress sets limitations of draft necessities, as well as is in charge of how we operate our military. the Court ruled that as long as woman weren't allowed in combat, then Congress could restrict them from the draft.\nIt's an odd element of history and the equal protection clause. Theoretically government must treat each citizen equally. but within that the government for very specific and few reasons can justify inequity among the populous.	Congress decides the necessity of the draft. Woman are not allowed in combat. Draft is primarily for combat. Woman cannot be drafted. \n HOPE this hasn't already been stated.

There's 5 of us in a flat, and due to personal issues with one of them, I've decided to move out (basically I tried to help a depressed flatmate and got involved too much, which in turn gave me mental health problems and now I've been advised by a psychiatrist to move or I won't get better.) \n &nbsp; \n Unfortunately the other flatmates didn't take kindly to this, and at first they didn't want me to leave. Then, when they accepted that I was leaving, they didn't want anyone new to replace me. \n &nbsp; \n So they've done the logical thing of sabotaging my viewings by turning people away, smoking weed during viewings, and being generally rude to completely nice people. The situation is beyond bad, all of them for some reason hate me with a passion, and so will be spiteful to the end of time if they have to. \n &nbsp; \n At this point I don't even want to subject the potential flatmate to these awful people I used to call friends, but I know that as soon as someone moves in and they accepted it, they'd go back to being friendly and normal. \n &nbsp; \n Now this is where the legal part comes in, my property manager has stated that for someone new to replace me, all my flatmates would have to send an email stating that they are happy with the new flatmate. \n &nbsp; \n Of course they'll never agree to this because they're literally the worst, and want to cause me as much stress as possible, because I apparently haven't had enough. \n &nbsp; \n I have however read the tenancy agreement and it doesn't state this anywhere. Is there a way I can bypass this and put someone in the flat without their approval? Even better, is there a way I can cancel the tenancy without even replacing myself? \n &nbsp; \n Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you for reading. \n &nbsp;	Leaving flat, finding someone to replace me, flatmates are sabotaging viewings, need some guidance.	336	14	other
Teachers aren't the problem, they're victims of it. The government (federal and state) gives grants to school districts based on performance, which is determined by, usually, graduation rate and standardized test scores. Bad rate of graduation (passing) and money gets cut, same for test scores. Money gets cut and the schools can't afford basic necessities (I.e. Textbooks, computers, buses, etc.). When these things are lost then scores get even lower, more money is withheld from these districts, and faculty are the next thing to go. Shortly thereafter the schools are forced to close, the unemployment in the area rises and the entire community is dragged down into poverty and ultimately incompetence. Now that's just a very brief crash course in what's wrong with one tiny aspect of the education system, but I hope it was informative.	if teachers don't take every possible step to ensure that kids pass then the entire community suffers horribly.	136	18	other
I feel I have some small issues lately. \n I am male, she is the lovely female. I have a small crush one of my best friends exes. Now, he (best friend) is in a very commited relationship for some time now (over a year at least). I talked with him, and he says its cool if I were to try and start something (100% fine with it). They are both still friends, and not awkward around each other at all, they dated about 3 years ago, for about a year. He gave me his blessing in a way, should I think about anything. \n Now, I sometimes feel as if some things happen for a reason, but also, I fall for people to quickly if I spend time with them in certain ways. In terms of friend value, she has been one of those who knows a decent about me, and by association, knows more of my emotional sides and my relationship past (in a nutshell, my last one was 8.5 years, were almost engaged). However, I feel that because she is one an ex of my best friends, it almost puts this unsaid invisible iron curtain up. I know its good from my end, but, I really wonder if she feels the same way. \n I would be happy to fill in details of your feedback should they come. I just don;t know how to fill in the situation. I know she is a great girl, and very special. \n We are now both graduated from college, both 24, involved in different areas of the arts (she is performing, I am digital/fine arts). I have not had a relationship in nearly a year and a half, but I feel as I converse with her more, I feel we seem to want the things we can offer each other.

I broke up with my girlfriend of about 3 months because I was suffering from pretty bad depression and I made some terrible choices like breaking up with her. Since then I've improved my way of thinking and my life immensely and I've realized that the reason I gave to myself about why I should break up with her was completely wrong (I felt like I was dragging her down because of my mental state). I've regained contact with her and it's exactly the same as before we were together, we get along incredibly well we can talk to each other about absolutely nothing for hours and hours on end, we understand and enjoy being in each others company and most of all we can put up with each others shit despite how filthy. We are great together she was the only one that understood what I went through and forgave me for what I did to her (I explained my flawed reasoning recently when we started talking again). We've been having a kind of FWB relationship for the past couple of weeks and it's been great because we're great together. For example I'm the type of person that gets off and enjoys giving other people pleasure and she is very easy to please especially because I know how. I'm sorry for this dragging on but I've had some shitty advice in the past and I want to make sure I have everything out. I think I want to be more than what we are now, however I don't really know how she feels about it and if she feels the same way we're very open with everything together and I think that's what makes us get along with each other so well. \nI don't want to lose the friendship we have now by trying to progress it more especially since we've talked about just accepting whatever might come of it. I want to be something more and I'm confident she's the one I want to be something more with. \n I would greatly appreciate your opinions and advise on this. \n throwaway because she knows my username.	Should I ask her to be something more than whatever we are now?	356	13	other
Speaking from experience, my $0.02 is that maybe it would be in your best interest to take some time off from him as you said it yourself that you two are FWB as far as I have read. If that's the case, I'd say don't bother stressing over him too much and let him deal with his own ordeals while you deal with yours. If you two are together, while it is noble that you want to support him and help him, it is best to support only yourself if you find that you are buckling beneath said issues because with or without him, you will have to worry about your own future. Heartache is hard but it can be overcome much easier than and financially cheaper than (at this stage of a relationship) buckling under pressure in school since it generally sets the precedence to your intended career field. \n As far as his depression goes, it is generally insanely hard to get out of depression because in my experience it takes either forcing and willing yourself through depression and doing things that will make you happy or simply twiddling your thumbs waiting for it to pass. As a person who has dealt with and a person who has had a SO with depression, it is also extremely difficult for the person trying to support them. For one, you get near nothing in return for your efforts from them, that is, they rarely show any signs of improvement or letting you in which mentally and emotionally depletes you. Two, they may lash out at you constantly and/or blame you for their issues usually stating you could never understand what they're going through which again depletes you. Three, it grows onto you and slowly siphons what little hope you have because every step forward is like trying to swim against a rapid current, an exhaustive effort that tends to leave you hopeless despairing at what little gains you've made. I can keep going on but you've probably got the picture.	If FWB do not worry about friend. If not FWB, deal with own situation first. Depression sucks and is soul crushing.	339	21	other

"I have no problems with this as someone who grew up in the restaurant business, but until then, why don't you just add the costs to the price of your meal? Instead of paying 10 dollars for your entree and having a 2 dollar tip, just pretend your entree costs 12 bucks. If restaurants were to pay more, they would raise their prices. \n However, consider that perhaps there's a rationale behind tips? As a recent Berkeley graduate as well as someone who grew up in a busy and successful restaurant business, perhaps I can provide some insight. \n Tips are what keep a server motivated to do their job, and to do it well. Without a tipping system, it'd be hard to get good service. Yes, many jobs require a positive attitude as well as patience when working with customers. If not, then you're fired, and replaced. The difference is that servers are paid minimum wage, and no one wants to be a waiter for that pay when you could get an easier min-wage job. Being on your feet constantly is tiring, and the job itself is actually a skilled position. In fact, I would argue that it, at times, is much more complicated and strenuous than a typical entry level position (I can provide scenarios that show why). It takes a new server an average of 3 months to become ""good"" at their job, competent enough to handle a busy weekend rush. So, in short, you do your job and deal with customers in a positive way because you can be replaced with one of the many college graduates. However, servers are hard to train and there is an extreme dearth of applicants. \n Not saying that it's the best system, but I bet you would receive worse service without one. However, maybe an increase in pay would lead to a greater pool of applicants, thus defeating this problem. \n By the way, here in California we pay min. wage plus tips."	Just add the tip to the price of your meal to adjust for the increase in restaurant overhead. The tip system may be the only thing motivating your server to treat you well, due to the lack of competition for their job.	330	42	other

"After being a customer for nearly a decade I closed my primary checking account with Wells Fargo on May 25th 2012.  I closed it due to them making automatic transfers to different branches of Wells Fargo.(credit card, student loan)  I went in to speak with them about the resulting overdraft charges.  They would not reimburse me for the resulting overdrafts so I closed my account then and there.  They lost a loyal customer of nearly a decade over $70 in overdraft fees.  I have in hand the paper work claiming the account has been closed.  I checked my online banking account and the account was no longer there.  I thought this was the end of it and moved on. \n Nearly three weeks later, June 11th 2012, I received an overdraft notice in the mail for this same account.  I had transferred all recurring bills to a new account except for netflix which was automatically withdrawn via paypal from my now ""closed"" Wells Fargo account.  Wells Fargo reopened my account  without   my   consent  and charged the 7.99 for netflix + their $34 overdraft fee.  Even if I had remembered the netflix charge and wanted to transfer money into the account, it was not possible because it was closed.  I am furious and I am going to Wells Fargo first thing in the morning to make my concerns known.  I am slightly upset that I owe this $42, but I am absolutely irate over the principle of the matter.  I am in the process of writing letters to the BBB as well as congressmen of Colorado.    What other courses of action would others recommend.

Hey, you know, nothing against you, but you probably haven't been in the military and its really easy to have that subjective lying government attitude towards its activities.

"Hey there, looking for some insight. I'm 19 years old, male, and one of my good friends --also male -- just turned 22. We went to school together, but became closer as friends sometime after my own graduation. He's a difficult guy to know on a very personal scale, but from what I've seen he's a genuinely good and down-to-earth guy. \n Recently this summer, after exhausting all ideas for activities, he suggested we go hang out with one of his female friends. So we meet up at a local coffee place, and had a really good time. This was my first time meeting her, yet we got along great; she's a real social butterfly. She's about my age, and we seem to be onto a lot of the same things (e.g. comics, retro gaming, new wave music.) \n After parting ways with her, my friend and I stayed out and got a couple drinks. I questioned him about her, and found out a lot about their history. Apparently she's his ex-gf, from a year and a half long relationship. He was my age at the time, and she left him for another guy --who she's no longer with-- because she didn't agree with how he was conducting his life at that time. My friend confessed that he's still madly in love with her, despite a long period where neither of them were on a good terms with each other. Finally, he's accepted that there's no prospect of a future for them; at least past a very platonic friendship. \n After a couple more hangouts, I ended up trading contact information with her. We typically chat just about comics and stuff, but I noticed she would flirt with me on occasion. I asked her about my friend (not disclosing anything he told me) and she said he's a very passionate dude, but couldn't ever see herself being with him again. I confessed I had a crush on her, and we scheduled another hang out just us two. We ended up making out. \n We had been ""seeing"" each other behind my friend's back for about a month up to this point. He contacted me earlier this week telling me he's aware that there's something going on between his ex and I. The way he talked to me about it was incredibly patient and empathetic, much more than I would have been able to invoke had I been in his shoes. However, since then he's totally ""vanished,"" so to speak. I believe he just decided to block me out for invading on his love life, despite there being no future. Am I wrong?

However, that would be similar to something like eating meat. Some people say that it doesn't make sense (based on some grounding, possibly animal rights or health benefits). Saying that something is just a social norm means that you don't determine whether something is actually consistent with our other views. \n I use the animal rights argument since they mostly base their arguments on being consistent with underlying views.

I am looking to start gathering info/applying to graduate programs soon, and I have this bad habit of being interested ( at least minimally) in almost everything I have studied related to my field (biology). \n Most of my undergrad biology experiences lies in the realm of Cell biology- and I would be happy to continue to make a research career out of that. But that is too wide of an interest for graduate programs. \n I have a few more specific interests related to cell biology ( toxicology and/or physiological effects of substance abuse), but how do I test to find out whether these interests are ones that I could pursue with vigor for the length of my career? I notice that I have an optimistic personality, and really just love science in general( at least so far). This makes me worry that I may not make the best choice for a graduate program, and might unintentionally just apply to places that interest me in that instant.	How does one test whether an interest in a certain topic is just a passing fad or a more substantial interest?	166	21	other
If you want to make sure you'll not regret your tattoo, wait to get it. I thought of my first tattoo when I was about 16. I even picked out the font and decided on the location. Then I waited until I was 19 to get it. I never once questioned if I wanted it because it has a lot of personal significance to me to this day. It's a motto on my upper left arm, really represented a lot of shit for me to this day. I even got one on my right arm which further compliments my original tattoo. It's been several years now, and I still smile every time I see them. I have something that represents a lot of the struggles I faced in high school and undergrad, and at the same time the meaning continues to grow as I grow as a person and learn more about the world and myself.	If you want a tattoo, pick something with a lot of personal significance to you, and wait a while to see if you still want it.	156	26	other
"I have this good friend for about two years. The friendship has always kinda fluctuated due to life and what not. But I feel like we've always been close. We hang out one on one, she shares a lot of life stories with me, and I do her too. When she got locked up last year, she wrote me while she was in jail, and we hung out a lot when she got out. \n I remember not too long ago, when we were hanging out and drinking, she told me that I am one of her best friends and she's glad that I'm apart of her life and that I'm one of the few people that know a lot about her life and her past. \n However, I haven't seen her in over a month, going on 2. The last time we hung out one on one  (just us two) was February. I'm worried that she might have lost interest because I never made a move, despite her dropping subtle hints (Ie: One time she came over to my house, and according to my roomates, was all dolled up just to watch  a movie). \n I really like this girl A LOT. She's one of my best friends and I don't think I can ever find a girl that I click with like her, and I do know how to talk to women. \n Anyway, late last month I sent her a text, she didn't reply to it. 2 weeks later, I went on a vacation and posted some photos, and she ""Liked"" one of them, so at least a minor interaction was a good sign. A week after I got back, I sent her another text. This was last Tuesday. \n Me: Hey. How's everything been. I hope good :) \n[No response for a day] \nMe: Hey, I hate to be annoying, but is everything cool between us? If I did anything wrong, I'd like to know what. \n Her:  Hey! I'm so sorry. I've been meaning to text you. You didn't do anything wrong. \nMe: Word. I was just curious because it's been a minute. How've you been btw? \n Her:  Good. Just working a lot. I finally got my court case settled. I was going to move out of my mom's house, but now I have  2500 of court fees to pay off. \nMe: That sucks about your fees. That's good you at least got your court case behind you. BTW, do you like comedy shows? [Redacted] and I are going to one on Saturday, and I have a few extra tix. \n Her:  I have to work Saturday unfortunately. What time is the show? \nMe: 730 \n Her:  Yeah, I'm probably not going to be able to go.. \nMe: Okay. Well, we should hang out sometime when you're free. \n[Conversation ended] \n I feel like I could have re-established attraction after she mentioned moving out of her mom's house. I probably should have told her about a goal of mine too, but I didn't. \n Anything I can do to salvage everything? This conversation happened 8 days ago btw. I miss her to death. I really miss our conversations, etc. She is one of my best friends, and I'd like to salvage and figure out why we haven't hung out in a while."

I'm in college. I'm the type of person who is pretty wild with people I know, but incredibly filled with social anxiety. Even when I'm in bed watching movies with girls I know, I just don't do anything. I sit there the whole movie trying to think of ways to interact and make my move, but I just sit there frozen. Even with girls I've slept with before and have invited me over just to fool around, I am nervous with. It doesn't help that I hang out with a bunch of smooth talking snake charmers, who could say anything and get any woman.

To make a long story short, my macbook was stolen out of my car a couple weeks ago. I filed a police report and combed through craigslist for weeks trying to find it and eventually gave up. I decided to move on with my life and buy a new one. \n I didn't want to buy a brand new one so I decided to buy one off CL. I found one that I thought was perfect for me but it was located over an hour away. Whatever, I had nothing to do that day so I brought boyfriend with me and we took a little trip. \n We met this guy at a coffee shop and asked a bunch of questions. It seemed legit enough and I purchased the computer. Fast forward two days and I get a hunch to google the serial number of the computer and of course a hit came up on stolen-properties.com. Great, I just bought a stolen computer and I am a huge asshole. \n I read through the stolen-property report and I get to the bottom when I REALIZE THAT I AM READING MY OWN REPORT. I JUST BOUGHT MY OWN GOD DAMN STOLEN COMPUTER FROM THIS ASSHOLE. ARRGGHH!! \n I don't know if I want to cry or laugh. I feel so fucking stupid. I compared the computer serial number to my receipt 50 times just to make sure I wasn't going CRAZY. Like seriously, what the fuck is the probability that I choose to buy MY lap top out of the hundreds floating around the bay area? I feel I got kicked in the stomach and slapped in the face. \n I went to the police department immediately to tell them what I just discovered. The person on duty was super helpful (shockingly) but was honest with me. The chances of them pressing criminal charges on this person was slim to none because this guy would basically have to confess that he was the one to actually steal my computer, or that he knew it was stolen when he bought it. BUT I am free to press civil charges if I want to possibly get my money back. \n So this is where I need help. I KNOW this guy. I AM LOOKING AT HIM ON FACEBOOK RIGHT NOW. I know his full name, where he works, where he LIVES, (his actual address) fuck I know the names of everyone in his immediate family (I <3 the internet). But I don't know how to proceed with him. Do I text his phone? (Which I think might be a burner) Do I like, show up at his work? Send a FB message? Do I plead with him? Do I threaten to sue him? Do I tell his mommy on him? I realize that it's possible that NOTHING could come of this even if I chose the civil route, but I am just SO PISSED that I want to do something. \n This is what I have: \n Original receipt of my Macbook purchase\nPolice report, which includes serial number \nThe post ID of the CL ad (since now has been deleted)\nSeller's phone number, facebook page, home address and place of work. \n What can I do to increase the likelihood of getting this guy to pay me back.

It feels amazing and will probably be legalized at a federal level within the next 20 years. I can't stand when people blame marijuana for laziness. If you started giving a lazy guy coffee everyday you think he'd suddenly become productive? If you're a good student then marijuana won't suddenly make you a bad one. I feel like it's a self-fulfilling prophecy they incept in health class.

Formula for success: \n Phase 1 (Ned Flanders):  spend 30-90 seconds making small talk and being effusively kind; during this phase, document the name/operator ID of the unsuspecting associate \n Phase 2 (make request):  if successful, go no further; if denied, proceed to phase 3 \n Phase 3 (Mugatu):  absolutely LOSE YOUR SHIT at the associate and request a manager (or account closure/retention department); it's important that your outburst is sufficient to cause the associate to indicate to the manager that this call is somehow out of the ordinary (primes the manager that s/he may need to do something extraordinary to fix the situation) \n Phase 4 (blame associate):  become completely reasonable again and explain that the associate's inability/unwillingess to satisfy your request must result from lack of training/understanding, substandard customer service that obviously deviates from the company's usually stellar service, and - when applicable - language barrier (makes the manager feel uniquely qualified to resolve the situation) \n Phase 5 (reinforce):  if successful, ask for contact information of a superior so that you may give feedback about the excellent service you received; if unsuccessful, ask for contact information of a superior so that you may give feedback about why you will NEVER again be a customer (liberally use the associate's name you earlier obtained) and explain that you also plan to detail the interaction on your blog with a readership of over 800,000 people	you actually catch more bees with a honey-shit-honey sandwich than you do with honey alone.	230	15	other

I like this girl, she is cute and sexy and all that.  She asked me to come over and hang out, dinner, wine and all that, which was really nice.  She asked if I wanted to stay over and she said I could take the couch, and she went into her room....okay. \n After she would invite me over and ask when I would invite her to my place and asked me why don't I kiss her or ask her out, (so I'm thinking, okay she likes me at least a little) I would stay at her place and she would sleep on the couch with me, but there isn't any room to mess around, only kiss a little bit.

I was an IT Admin for an organization with 175 employees. We had 3 sites and 1 satellite office. Under me was 1 support desktop tech that worked part time. Between our shifts being staggered i had 4 hours a day where i did not assist employees support tickets. During these hours i generated reports to the government. a few monthly reports, some additional ones quarterly, and a few more at then end of the year. Backups needed to be tested weekly, and updates to the website for news or job postings needed to be made. Along with plenty of other stuff that was all my job. \n When servers act up (and they do) i had to fix them. people would think i was lying when i said a file server was offline when they could still access their files (NFS clustering). Or that an email or database or router was acting up. All of this was my job, not helping with support tickets when the desktop tech was clocked in. If they had to wait because he was helping someone else they would QQ so hard that i wouldn't get up while i was remotely fixing another office's servers and help them with some line they couldn't remove in word that turned out to be a table with all of its cells removed. I remember once i was asked to look at her computer because it was slow after the tech had her restart . A quick look showed it was running its anti-virus as it should when it first boots. She wanted me to turn it off (do you want viruses? cause thats how you get viruses), i refused and she actually told me it was unacceptable and will speak to my direct supervisor (she was under a chief of staff) about having me replaced (which didn't happen). \n When the housing market crashed i was given a new budget that once you take out all of the software and hardware maintenance money, it came to a single FTE at a lower wage then mine. With the budget they gave me i was suppose to get rid of my desk tech support and take a paycut. So i gave my desk tech a small raise and offered him full time and left at the end of the year when my old budget expired. \n later i found he still worked there and they outsource ALL of the stuff i did in house. They pay a web developer, a database reporting agency, MS 360 for about 25 employees. The rest of the staff have no email (which cuts communication down between employees), they have no file servers with backups (only store their files locally). They cannot access the database which i had an intranet site (i spent tons of hours on its PHP) they used it regularly to assist with their work. I left all of this working the day i left but the desktop tech (in which every one except my direct supervisor was happy to have over me when i left) couldn't keep the systems up. Only the intranet website servers were linux. All of the other servers were microsoft technology but the guy struggled to learn AD.	don't bother reading its just a rant from upper IT QQing about having to help with desktop service calls.	539	19	other
"To understand why magazines, advertisers, blogs and popular culture tries to sell us our masculinity back, you have to look for why we need to buy it. Back at the turn of the 20th century, and up u til about the 1970,s a man had a defined role, it was easy to identify as a man. Men worked, women stayed at home. Men drank whiskey, women drank wine. This was reinforced by advertisers of the time, one only needs to link at  things like malboro, and the malboro man campaigns of the 60's vs the Virginia slims campaigns of at the same time. Weather a man worked at an office, or in the factory, a man had their place. At some point during the late 60's and through 70's, the baby boomers began to question things like sexuality, morals and gender roles. While many of these things helped marginalized groups like minorities and women, it displaced the traditional core of gender roles in men, especially white, middle aged suburban men. \n At some point in the 80's and through the90's, it became acceptable for women to assume many of the roles and jobs men used to dominate. Women where more educated and self reliant than ever before. Because of this, many families had two working professionals, sharing what was once the traditional role of the husband as the head of the family.  As time has moved on, and equality has increased, we see the changes in popular culture. For example, a show like Rosanne, back in the 90's would of never made it 20 years, or even 10 years before, but it reflected the reality of the the times. A woman who was an equal to her husband, and a husband who struggled with not always being the provider or decision maker in the family. I essence, over the last 30-40 years, men have lost their traditional gender roles, what it means to be a man no longer fits in to a neat little box, so a whole market has risen to cater to us, who want to define what a man is. \n This market is trying to capitalize on the fact that there is no one definition of what being a man means. Shows like Mad Men portray a time when ""men where men"" and sell us on the idea that maybe things where easier back then. A lot of the products and styles now popular are a result of this. Advertisers and retailers are harking back to a time when we knew what a man was, this is why GQ will tell you how your new skinny suit will make you look manlier, how learning to drink single malt scotch will impress your boss, and how knowing how to cook a steak will solidify your man credentials and make you a man like the ones that no longer are around, a Vagine destroying Machine."	gender roles changed in the last 30 or so years, and retailers and advertisers are trying to sell us on the idea that we can be the men our fathers and grandfathers used to be, because they knew what a man really was, because women knew their place.	485	48	other

So back story first; a year and a half ago I called off a wedding with my fiancee due to infidelity on her part. In the fall out her family was seeking repayment from me to cover the following things: \n \n A non refundable plane ticket for the honeymoon. \n 'Wedding gifts' including a new stove, new cabinets, and a new counter in the kitchen of the condo in my name. \n \n I foolishly said I felt obligated to pay them something back but never officially agreed on a set amount. \n In the past year and a half her cat, which she has repeatedly claimed to be here has remained in my condo and has since destroyed the carpet. I have repeatedly asked them to take their cat, yet I get no response. \n I do not have much surplus income as I have recently switched careers and spent a month unemployeed in the transition. \n Now, I have come to find out that her father has filed a debt collection lawsuit in the amount of 10k dollars. This is far more than any amount I have ever stated was reasonable. \n My questions are as follows: does that family have legal standing to sue me? Can I force the issue of having this cat removed from my residence as she on multiple occasions has claimed the cat as her own. \n I personally am not in the best financial position yet to afford a lawyer myself if I do receive a summons, I have sent them money in the past when I have had, albeit not on a regular basis. \n Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

The best first date formula IMO is having equal parts excitement (distraction from awkwardness, something interest to talk about, sharing a fun experience) and intimacy (close quarters, conversation, getting to know each other). This can be a difficult combination for the introverted, anxious, or socially awkward redditor. \n Problem: The dinner & movie date achieves the equilibrium very easily, which is why it's a popular date idea. But it splits it into two parts, when doing them simultaneously is much more successful. If you're awkward, you probably feel uncomfortable sitting next to someone for hours without speaking, and once you've exhausted the topic of said movie at dinner, conversation can get stale very quickly. \n Solution: Go to a museum, an amusement park, go sledding or hiking, etc. You can be intimate when you want to, you can have excitement when you want to. When conversation lulls, you can do something interesting to keep the atmosphere exciting. When you're tired and want a break, you've have things to talk about and shared experiences to get you out of your shell. \n Outcome: you seem interesting enough to come up with new date ideas, you have successfully entertained your date, and you've gotten to know them.	Don't segregate the excitement and intimacy, let them live together in harmony and have the introvert's perfect date.	202	18	other
"I know that it is supposedly because ""violence is never the answer"" malarkey, but it is completely bullshit from my experience at least. \n I had a kid harassing me at school for awhile. Over several years actually. It sorta just kept escalating, but I never did anything because I was never really bothered. It was all talk. Then one day he somehow gets my phone number and starts talking shit over the phone and facebook. \n Finally when he harassed me in class the next day (I had told my mom and asked if she could do something, guess he found out and decided to give me shit) I just decked him in the nose. I was the aggressor. Didn't even knock em onto the floor, I just really wanted to hit him so I did and he hit back obviously. We both get suspended for three days and... that was it. Neither of us said a word to the other until the next year when he had a class with me. \n Actually, he seemed much more relaxed and I was too. All the problems were gone. Hell, I even got bit more known because he was kinda popular so being the person who punched him gives you at least some reputation. Never abused it though."	Was being bullied, violence solved all the problems and even was rewarding in the end.	215	15	other
Hey guys, quick question about my baby's name. I recently gave birth to a son and during the entire pregnancy my husband and I disagreed on our son's first name. My husband said he wanted to name him after himself and I wanted to give my son his own name. \n In the end, I relented and named my son the same first name as my husband. \n 3 weeks after giving birth my husband decided to inform me he wants a divorce. \n The thing is, hes currently serving overseas and will be there for at least another year and a half before hes back home in the U.S. \n Before he left, he granted me power of attorney over everything. \n I feel as though he waited till after the birth of our son to inform me he wants a divorce because he knows I would never have named him his first name if I knew we were splitting up. \n So my question is this: With my power of attorney, am I able to legally change my son's first name? My son is only 5 weeks old so it's not like he's used to his name by any means.	Changing my son's name with power of attorney.	196	8	other
"Once, I was going over to my friend Derek's house to play some Super Smash Brothers. It was a Saturday and as I went to get my keys my mom stopped me and told me to run by the H.E.B. on my way home to pick up dinner for the family. \n So I went and played SSB at Derek's house until his drunk dad threw the Gamecube and told us to gtfo because I'd been fooling around with Derek's sister and he found out. \n Well anyways I went to H.E.B. and picked up some stuff for spaghetti. On the way out of the parking lot I was thinking about Derek's sister, then saw a sign some kids had vandalized. It said ""Enter Butt"" because the other two words had been scratched off. Thinking back to Derek's sister I smiled knowingly."	Butt	140	1	other
"Ugh. This makes me so upset. Story time. Against my better judgment, I upgraded (at my expense), my now wife's families router (from G to N) in order boost the range. \n After upgrading,  her father INSISTED I ""broke the internet"" because internet explorer would not load any web pages. After trying to explain (to no avail. Even after showing him that data was  transfering through windows) that the browser is not the internet, I managed to trouble shoot the issue. Turns out, it was one of the 20 or so toolbars he installed, which crashed IE. \n I then got bitched out by her sister because the password I choose didn't meat her wacky criteria (2 upper case letters, 2 lower, 3 symbols, 3 numbers, and 15 digits, all random). This was for a house, the only one on the street, in the middle of nowhere."	upgraded router, got blamed for breaking the internet because IE would not load. \n shudder  never again...never ever again	145	18	other

This means that we vote for our leaders, and our leaders vote for actual movements. By voting for our leaders, we DID give them permission to go to war without our direct consent.

One time I had just parked my truck at walmart on a very windy day. The wind was howling louder than those wolf motherfuckers that wanted to eat Liam Neeson. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a maverick cart/buggy on an impact course with a Nissan Altima. I thought to myself, this is my moment. I quickly but carefully opened the door as to not hit the door of the adjacent car. I ran around the front of my truck and ran towards the car. Coming down the isle was a moped driven by a man who can only be described as looking like Father Time. I had no time to wait for this clown. I somersaulted over that old bastard and continued my blitz maneuver towards the cart/buggy. By the time I got there I wasn't able to stop it so I had to put myself between the cart/buggy and the car. It hurt like a motherfucker. The woman who owns the car rushed toward me to thank me. She was kind of flirting with me and I got all nervous and punched her in her face and ran toward the walmart door stopping to donate a dollar to whatever the fuck they had a charity for. Taking a breath, I calmly walked to my isle of choice and grabbed the tomatoes I needed for taco night.	I needed tomatoes for taco night.	231	6	other
"BACKGROUND: I live at the bottom of a cul-de-sac where the angle is about 20 degrees.  I work nights and just went to bed at 09:00 oclock in my bedroom ( I don't usually sleep in my bedroom I like to crash on my couch and THAT DAY decided I wanted to sleep in my bed instead ). At about 9:30AM I heard a loud ""CRASH"".  I went downstairs completely zoned out and there was a commercial Ford 250 heavy duty in my diningroom and partially in my livingroom.  The front bumper of the Ford completely destroyed the place where I sleep.   Supposedly the workers parked the truck up the street, they heard a POP and the truck started to barrel down to my house and they couldn't catch it.  It went straight into my house. I called MY insurance company and they stated that the commercial truck's insurance is responsible, but they did help me by starting the claim while I was still in shock.  Now I have a claim at the other insurance company and I am supposed to be submitting quotes to them.  Is this the best option? what should I be doing? I am overwhelmed.  I have contacted a lawyer to represent me but is this the best option? I am typing this from a hotel as an county inspector had to come to the house and he declared it unlivable."

"I had the same problem with a cable company.  They would come out, stand around, and then insist nothing was wrong or make some totally worthless ""repair"".  Six different times.  What I ended up doing was calling customer service, demanding a manager, and then giving the manager the information about all of the previous service calls with no resolution of the problem.  He wasn't particularly sympathetic until I told him I had four different active blogs, and if the problem wasn't fixed in two weeks, I was going to post my complaints about their lousy service on all of them, and every other place I could find on the internet.  Then I confirmed with him the correct spelling of his first and last name, (which I had asked for at the start of our conversation), since I would be including his name in all my online complaints.  Now maybe it was just coincidence, but three guys from the cable company were digging up my front yard to replace the cable two days later.  Haven't had a problem since."

"and as soon as THAT is connected to the colour of skin, it is racism again. \n The point is, it is not skin colour or origin that are the problems. It are SOCIOECONOMIC problems, which the Republicans desperately need to admit. Because ""more freedom"" is NOT going to fix that. On the other hand, just pouring money into it obviously doesn't fix the issue either. What is necessary are options for these people, and smartly set incentives, and the right counselors. And non-demonising social aid - if everyone getting it is stigmatised, like right now, the affected people are even more excluded and more likely to go criminal."	The problem is socioeconomics instead of culture or race, and smart welfare is the only solution.	108	16	other
