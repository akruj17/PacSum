"Alright. I met this girl two or so years ago at a camp in my small town in Arizona. \n We were friends for the duration of the camp, which was 7 days or so. Afterwards, however, we parted ways. We live close-by...just never got in touch. \n Recently, out of boredom, I sent her a text. Ever since we've been texting a lot. At 8:00 AM yesterday she sends me a message ""Top of the 'mornin'!"" We then talked the majority of the day, till she lost reception. She was traveling to Nevada I believe. There are a lot of ':)' in her texts. The past two days I've started the conversations, but for almost a whole week she started them. Everyday. \n I didn't know if I liked this girl, but... I think I do now. I was awake all last night thinking about her and I have no idea why. \n She is quite a ways away in Nevada (for a trip), and she joked about her coming and picking me up and bringing me. She also tried to convince me to drive out and see her (which I, sadly, cannot do.) \n Do you think she has a thing for me? Should I ask if she does? Or should I arrange a time to get together in person; then see from there? \n Thanks."	Started texting girl from camp. Had some previous affection towards her; but not much. She starts most conversations and uses a lot of smiley faces ( ' :)' ). She talked about driving from Nevada (where she is vacationing) and picking me up. She also talked about me driving there and seeing her.	222	53	relationship_advice
"So we've been dating for just over a year and we've hit a few rough patches. I've definitely been experiencing severe mood swings since I started the pill a little less than a month ago, but these feelings have been going on since long before that. He's said some really mean things to me out of the blue before that sometimes still stick. Like he had given me a few of his sweaters, and for no reason he said, ""I hope you know I want these back if and when we break up."" I admit that I can be kind of sensitive so maybe that wouldn't sting others as much as it stung me, but I was indeed very hurt by it. He acknowledged that later and apologized for it, but it's just kind of stuck around. \n I've had clinical depression since before he and I started dating, and we've both had our ups and downs with handling that, but lately it's seemed more down than normal. he used to call and text fairly often, but it's been on a sharp decline in recent weeks. He mentioned that he has needed some alone time, which I can understand since we're both pretty busy and stressed out, but I can't help but blame myself and feel guilty. He hasn't said directly that it's my fault, but I know that the emotions I've been experiencing lately have had a negative affect on a lot of my current relationships with friends, family, coworkers, and now him. \n We kinda talked it out the other day and it went pretty smoothly. There was no yelling, no accusatory phrases, no hurtful airing of grievances. We just went over what it is we both need from the relationship right now. I thought we came to a decent compromise, but he doesn't seem to be holding up his end of said compromise. \n Most of what I've been experiencing lately is loneliness because of his need to be alone and all of my friends pulling away (probably because I've been acting like a real sad sack). So, I figured since he needs the extra space and I don't, we would have a thing where he would just kinda check in and let me know how his day is going or something like that. Doesn't have to be constant communication, doesn't have to be him always telling me where he is or who he's with, just kinda letting me know what's up every few hours or sending me a funny picture. It's only been a day so I don't want to say anything yet, but should I if this keeps up? What would I say? Is it fair to expect this kind of compromise at all?"	We always seem like we're doing okay when we're together, but when we're apart, I feel like he avoids me because I'm a sad sappy sucker. What do I do? \n Edit: grammar	456	32	relationship_advice
"Let me start off with that he is an amazing guy. We've known each other since we were 17, but we've been getting to know each other on a very personal level for the past few weeks. He literally swept me off my feet. Really, the only downside is that his ex wife (been divorced for over a year because of HER infidelity while he was in the military) calls him everyday. If he doesn't answer (which he doesn't) she'll just keep calling until I tell him ""Just answer and see what she wants"". \n She is always questioning him about where he and I are in terms of a relationship. She asks whether we're having sex and if we're using protection. They also just have regular conversations with each other while I'm just sitting there waiting for him to get off the phone. The kicker is he'll avoid questions or lie and use the excuse ""she has no right to know what I'm doing, she's not my wife anymore"" and assures me that he is over her. If he were over her wouldn't he just be up front and explain that I'm in the picture and I plan on being for a while? \n I'm worried that if he and I continue what we are doing that if it evolves into a relationship (which it pretty much is already- he just says he has a really nice surprise this weekend and I'm thinking he's going to want to make this official) am I going to have to deal with her calling everyday. Any advice on how to cope with this would be awesome. Am I stupid for wanting to continue on with someone who is constantly visiting the past everyday?"	"Guy I'm dating talks to his ex wife everyday, she's constantly asking about us and he'll lie to her because ""she doesn't have the right to know""."	289	27	relationship_advice
"Backstory: My boyfriend and I moved across the country at the beginning of 2015. His sister, M, was my best friend, and I actually met my boyfriend through her. M came to visit us at the end of March, and bought a one way ticket. Originally, she was planning on staying for the summer, but she ended up getting homesick. The rest of my boyfriend's family (mom, dad, brother) came to visit us last Tuesday, and they are leaving tomorrow (Tuesday). M bought tickets for the same flight home as her parents and brother. \n Today, their dad asked me if the clothes in the dryer were mine, because he was doing a load of laundry. I went to check, and saw my favorite shirt (which should be hung to dry), 2 pairs of pajama shorts, and a pair of my yoga pants, among some of M's clothes. I was immediately furious, because my shirt was faded and and shrunk, and because I hadn't asked her to do laundry, and she hadn't asked my permission to add my clothes to her load. \n I went to her and told her that she ruined my shirt, and that she needed to buy me a new one. She obliged, and handed over the money. There were none in my size available online, but I called the store and they said that if I came in, they could order me one from another location. My roommate, R, and I, went to the store to order the shirt. While on the way, my friend calls, and I told him about the situation, and he says that it sounds like she was trying to steal my clothes. When R and I thought about it more, that shirt had been in the bottom of my laundry basket, and M had actually, at one point, complimented me on all of the other items that were in the dryer. \n We decided to send my boyfriend and the rest of his family out, so we could look in her suitcase and see if she had taken anything of ours. Before they left, M came up to me and said ""I'm gonna take the shirt"", I didn't know what she meant at first, but we ended up getting into a fight, because she felt that, since she paid for a replacement, that she deserved to keep the old one. I told her no, she washed my clothes without asking, ruined my shirt, and that I would be keeping the old one as a backup. When they all left, R and I went through her suitcase, and ended up finding 7 of my shirts, and 1 of my boyfriend's shirts. I am flabbergasted. Nobody helped while she packed, and my shirts were all inside-out, and tucked within other shirts, so I am certain that it wasn't a mistake. A few of the shirts had actually been hanging in my closet before she took them. She has been one of my ""best friends"" for years, I've put up with her compulsive lying for a long time, but this is a new low. R and I are currently waiting for them to return, and M has no idea what is waiting for her. My boyfriend is being really supportive, but I'm worried that she is going to try to lie her way out of it, which she is prone to do whenever she is caught in a lie. What should I say or do to confront her?"	Boyfriend's sister stays with us for a month, and on her second to last day she decides to wash my clothes without asking, and ruins my favorite shirt. My roommate and I look through her suitcase and find 8 of my shirts tucked away inside. Don't know how to confront her.	582	51	relationship_advice
Basically, (and bear with me, as I know what the obvious answer seems to be, but I'm not so sure!) I'm in a relationship with a girl who has fallen totally head over heels for me. \n She's quite needy/clingy, which I have suggested she limits, and I think she's tried, but it's not just that. I have an extremely busy lifestyle, and am training or working constantly, and now realise I just don't have time for a relationship like this. (A cliche I know, but it is genuinely true!) \n I really like her, she's a great girl, but this is stressing me out, and really I want to go back to being friends as we were before. She's bought motorcycle leathers and stuff (I have a motorbike) but I'll pay her back for those, as it just wouldn't be fair otherwise! However, that is a side issue! \n We both have horses, which we ride together, etc, and I want to still be friends, hanging out doing things like that, so I don't want to completely sever ties, and want to end it gently, so that can be a reality. \n The meat of the issue, though, is that she has exams (of the important variety) and I don't know whether I should be honest and end it now, explaining I just feel as though we work better as friends, and I'm just not set for a relationship, or whether I should basically string her along till the end of her exams, even though she already knows there's something up. Which would be less damaging?	Girlfriend has important exams, should I end it now (gently) and risk damaging her exams, or pretend until they're over (even though she knows something's up). Which would hurt her less?	263	31	relationship_advice
"So, I have been dating this girl for 6 months now, I would like to say deeply involved with each other but some days i'm not sure. We are both legal age (18) and my main concerns are that she doesn't want to take a picture together even after 6 months, she takes pictures with other people but not me. Another issue is that she doesn't want too touch me ever, like absolutely refuses to get near my private areas and if she even brushes against it she FREAKS OUT, and just stops whatever we are doing. We are sexually active like i will perform oral on her and she enjoys some kinky things like being a slave/tied up but if it comes to me she just stops and says no. She has offered no explanation as to why it grosses her out or why she says no. Every time i bring this up with her she gets mad and then just responds with ""okay"" ""sure"" like she never wants to hear it again or work anything out. So i guess im just asking for some advice about this."	My girlfriend wont touch my pee pee for no reason or do normal couple stuff	189	15	relationship_advice
"DTR: I would consider us best friends because he doesn't have any friends in our town (returned home from finishing college) and is kind of a loner type right now. Doesn't keep in much touch with anyone else. We started as FWB, he doesn't want a relationship because I'm too this or that (mostly explained below). \n A while ago he had an issue with me being passive aggressive, which I wasn't even aware of. He describes my behavior as off-hand comments. Which he said was angrily texting ""whatever ok"" or ""ok fine"" that kind of stuff. And my purpose with that kind of text isn't really to persuade a response, it's just the typical ""I am annoyed and I would like you to know so you don't push it."" Is that a normal thing to do? I always thought it was something everyone did, through text or verbally. I don't remember if I did this excessively but even if I didn't I took note to fix it. \n So while making an effort to be the least to 0 passive aggressive, I can't ever be dissatisfied. I can't indirectly be upset because that's obviously a no. And I can't be directly upset because that has always turned into ""I don't need this drama"" or ""You did this so I acted mean to you."" \n He says I'm very controlling because I ask a lot about what he's doing but I thought it was just conversation. So example, he says ""I'm busy tomorrow."" ""Oh okay. What are you doing?"" ""Eating with a friend."" ""Who?"" ""(friend's name)."" But since he said he doesn't like that because he's a private person I just don't ask now. \n So I guess the most recent thing was I wasn't invited to a ranked game online because he texted me he was going to queue with his friend, and then he said group got full so I can't join. I was waiting to play today because ranking alone is difficult (this isn't league) and I was just bummed he wouldn't wait for me or anything (I told him earlier I'd be kind of upset if that happened, and then it did). So I said ""wow fine I'll play by myself"" out of irritation, since I felt it was inconsiderate of him. He said I'm being controlling because I won't let him play with his friends and I didn't know how to feel about that and that I'm making off hand comments which I did recognize. But then he shut down the conversation and I just feel trapped again. \n It's like I can't say how I feel. I typed out a bunch of paragraphs and deleted them all over and over again because I feel like I'm walking on eggshells here. I keep concluding that anything I say is adding to ""drama"" and that it'll just make it worse. \n I can't remember the last time he apologized for anything. Even when I brought up at some point he never apologizes when I profusely apologize and compromise for things I sometimes do not even want to apologize for he said he can't feel pressured to feel sorry. \n I'm really trying my best but even when I say that and I try to justify what I do the blame still shifts to me. If you need more info feel free to ask."	i cant be passive aggressive, OR up front about my feelings and things are always my fault	560	17	relationship_advice
You kinda have to try to get angry. It sounds harsh but it's true. Right now you miss him, you're hurt and you don't want to be without him. You seem aware that he's a been a bit of a dick to you but you're still putting the good things infront of the bad. While this is ok sometimes it seems, at least to me, that in this situation you need to put the bad in front of the good, putting things into perspective can make a real difference. When you're with someone there will of course be good memories to look back on, but you have to remember that they are just memories. His texts saying he misses you and things are his indecisiveness, he doesn't appear to want you but doesn't want to be alone either. This is very common. You have to make sure the decision stays in your hands, that you are in control of your own mind and not let him manipulate you or talk you into things. Ask him not to get in contact with you for a while. A few weeks should do it. See how you feel then, without him around. In these few weeks make sure you are going out with your friends and keeping busy, don't let yourself dwell on him because that evades the point of this time. You need to see for yourself the person you can be without him. These few weeks will also help him. If he can take these weeks away from you and still misses you and decides he really wants you back then that is your decision to make. But don't wait for him. I'm not saying jump on the next guy you see but I'm saying don't sit and wait for him to call. You can do it on your own and do it well. If you both decide to be together again then do it with eyes open and a clean slate. If you choose not to be together then make the break clear. Remove all temptation, after breaking up with someone it is easy to slip into old habits purely because they are something you are used to but that isn't the best thing. You need to be strong and ensure that he knows that he can't just pick you up and drop you as he wants.	Spend some time without contacting him, go out, have fun, see how you feel in a few weeks, be strong.	397	20	relationship_advice
it's my 21st birthday today and i am again reminded of my 18th birthday when my family forgot it was my birthday. \n i feel guilty for even blaming my parents for my less than well-being because they really tried to do what they thought was the best for us. despite how hard they worked, i left the house feeling depressed, anxious, and resentful. i truly love them and they truly love me but my relationship with my family is not as close i think it should be. \n when i introspect and wonder where i went wrong, i always end up placing the blame on my parents... how they neglected my social well being, pushed me too hard in my academics, placed all the responsibilities and pressure on me as the first child... it's a toxic loop and i guess i do it because it takes the blame away from myself, making me the victim. \n but i realize that it is all futile. i would really like to get better. i would really like to stop feeling like this. i need to let go of everything, but it's so hard to stop blaming my parents for the way i am. \n i don't know if i made much sense. i feel so ungrateful and entitled even as i am writing this... yet i continue to feel sorry for myself for how mistreated i was, although i know full well that i really wasn't.

"So me (17F) and my boyfriend (21M) have been dating for a year now. We just got into our first fight last night over an umbrella, but lately he's been acting meaner to me than usual, first he said that I can't sing any songs by Wiz Kalifah because I'll ""ruin"" the music for him, then he tells me that I'm being embarrassing and always tells me to ""shh"" when I'm talking. Now all my emotions are built up and I show him this beautiful sun umbrella. He immediately shits on it and says ""you're not carrying that thing around and embarrassing me like that"" and ""I'm already tired of being made fun of out in public, you're not bringing that"" and I felt completely crushed. You see, I was really depressed that day and wanted to buy something that would cheer me up. I suddenly see this beautiful umbrella, the most beautiful and soft sun umbrella for 3$. I felt so excited to show him and it made me so happy to look at it. Now it disgusts me and I can't even look in its direction anymore :( . I blew up and told him to fuck off and that he's been an ass more than usual lately. He brushed it off saying that We're both being too sensitive right now, and he apologized. But he still won't let me take my umbrella outside. I feel that I'm not being too sensitive and I was just trying to enjoy myself, and he takes me down each time.

"I met this woman who was absolutely perfect. We hit it off right away. We had the same humor, and it was like we perfectly understood each other in every way. This woman was my dream girl in every aspect. From her personality to her physique. We met, and everything moved so fast from there. After the second day of meeting we had agreed we wanted to be ""official."" I had spent everyday with her since the day we had met, and we ended up sleeping together. Talking non-stop throughout the day. \n But after a couple days she told me that things weren't right. That she had unresolved feelings for an ex, and that she didn't expect to meet somebody like me so soon after putting herself out there. She wanted to talk things out with her ex, who had dumped her and crushed her heart. After they talked she told me that he wanted to try to fix thing with her. \n The next couple weeks I fought as hard as I could to prove myself to her, but we had known each other for such a short time nothing I could do had any merit to it. And all of this seems completely crazy, even to me. I never thought 'love at first sight' was a thing but I had fallen for her completely. In the end she wanted to be with her ex again, because apparently she felt the same way about him that I felt about her. Because her ex isn't a citizen of the US they are going to get married next weekend so that they can work things out and be together. \n I really just want her to be happy, so I am trying really hard to respect her choice since that is what she thinks is right for her. We chat every once in a while but it always seems to turn sour because I am having so much trouble letting go. We could be really great friends because we do have so much in common. But everyday I can't take my mind off of her. If my mind isn't occupied by something else it immediately wanders to her. \n I have already tried ""putting myself out there"" to meet other people, and I have talked to a few. But everybody I meet I just compare to her and have no interest in them. It isn't fair to anybody I meet, and I just feel so completely damaged. I have no idea what to do. I feel like a fool for getting so emotionally attached to somebody so easily and not being able to let go. \n Am I just insane or is it really worth fighting for her?

Do you think there is any chance me and her could be friends if I were able to get over her?"

"I put tF because we're both trans females. I'm on hormones while she's still waiting - you'll see why) \n So, I'm in college, while she's at home still living with her family. (It's a long distance relationship). Said family is in kind a tough financial situation right now, and she's at home picking up after them while they're out working. Because of the tough financial situation, she's not able to get into regular therapist appointments and so her medication - anti-depressants, ADD, and such - is kind of screwy right now. Lots of ""oh, this didn't work, let's put you on this"", only she's on that not working medication for a month until she can get into the next appointment. \n So, this is understandably making her a little unstable in some of our conversations. However, I'm a tad annoyed that she keeps saying ""I'm sorry for x, it's the medication/lack of medication/my ADD"" as an excuse for everything - not having a job, sitting on the computer all day, dropping out of college, etc etc. \n For example, she got pissy at me when I mentioned that a once-mutual friend's resume was not exactly what he said it was - He sent it as an example b/c I was looking for examples of someone with no work experience, he has plenty of experience (just not actual JOBS), and she replied ""oh, yeah, it's not like he's a pathological liar or that I sent you my resume or anything"" I said that I didn't have the link anymore since I got a new computer, and then asked why she got pissy at me. ""I'm just pissy in general, I'm changing medications"" \n She feels tied down due to the fact that her family says they want her there, and they have her doing most of the housework. I realize it's a difficult situation, but...maybe this is just because I'm young, but I don't understand what's preventing her from getting a job - even a simple, minimum wage one - and using the extra money to fix their dishwasher (which would mean a large reduction in housework), and maybe that would allow her to move out. \n I'm on the computer most of the day, as well, but I'm in college. I'm going to my classes, doing my homework...and I consider that a job. Honestly, I feel like she doesn't have any excuse for not having a job, outside of what she's said. I'm pretty shut in, so this is actually my first relationship that's gone this far. As a result, I'm not sure how to handle this. I feel like she's just making excuses...but I really can't relate to being in her position. I don't know how debilitating ADD is, but I feel like she's letting it get in the way of making any actual progress with her life. \n I used to have really depressive episodes, and I'll admit that I did (and still do) have some anger issues. I, however, decided that I couldn't let it get in the way of my life, and I'm working to not get as mad at things as well as shooing away any depressive thoughts. I did this without any kind of antidepressants, only the hormones that I'm taking as a part of being trans. But I realize that the hormones are a big factor.

I'm sorry to have to say this, but it's not going to be amazing the first time you have sex.  You will be awkward, you won't know what to do and you'll be nervous. \n HOWEVER this will be fine because she knows.  She sounds very understanding and so she's not going to expect to orgasm the first time you touch her, and she'll know you're going to orgasm very quickly.  It really won't be a problem, you just get more and more experience every time.  And I would suggest starting off with your fingers then move on to oral.	you can't have your first sexual experience be all about her because you won't know what you're doing, but it isn't a problem because she sounds understanding.	99	27	relationship_advice
"UPDATE: Apparently the girl before me basically ruined him, so he basically felt guilty with me liking him more than he likes me. He just told me he feels guilty because I'm practically in love with him and he isn't there yet. Or may even get there at all. So now I'm crying about it and kind of lost I guess. I feel a little unfulfilled, because despite the bad, he makes me really happy. \n \n So my boyfriend of 6 months and I went on vacation to Washington D.C. on Saturday, it was close to him since he lives in southern Maryland, but I've never seen D.C. before and he wanted to go so we could check out the area and he asked it there were any places I've wanted to go. The only place I've ever wanted to go to in D.C is the Smithsonian. \n So we got to go. But before we went, I needed to talk to the bank to make sure my check was cashed and in my account, and I had had a closed checking account too, so I needed to rectify that. Well, I couldn't fix my other account, so I decided to withdraw money and we decided to figure out what to do next. I said we needed to go to the credit union, and he asked where it was. I handed him the directions to get there on my phone, and he was trying to figure out where it was and then when I tried, he screamed at me, saying ""That isn't fucking helping!"" And then threw my phone in the back seat and was speeding with me in the car. \n So he apologizes to me, probably after hearing me crying (I'm not good with yelling at all, it reminds me of my parents fighting and my dad screaming at me). So I accept his apology, and we go on our merry way. \n The vacation was wonderful, I thought we both needed it, he seemed absolutely fine, and was fairly romantic with me, which is normally out of his nature since he's more of a quiet man. \n Get back from vacation on Sunday and he seems a little out of it, he says he's tired, and he takes my back to my school. Monday rolls around and I don't hear from him at all, and when I do, they're one word responses, and I sense that something's wrong. He tells me he needs some space, and that we can talk in a couple days after we both discuss the terms of it. \n Today I hear from him, because he wanted me to check in, but I wanted him to reach out to me first... so we talk for a bit, and then he says he needs to talk to me tomorrow about us. I'm worried at this point, and he asks if I'm okay, I tell him that I'm just worried and scared. He just apologizes to me and says the reason why we can't talk today, which is that he has band practice and he has his last day of work tonight. \n He's been really stressed lately too, and he just got a new job, this is after hopping jobs for a couple months because he was unhappy with the jobs he was doing. I think he's depressed because he had a really fulfilling job in something he wanted to do, and he worked with a start up company that had a super successful kickstarter, and the company fell through. \n I just don't know what to expect tomorrow and I'm really scared, and I've been on and off crying all day today.... Help??"	for the bank: Withdraw money, get screamed at by boyfriend, apologizes, go on vacation, have what I presume to be a good time, come back and he tells me he needs space.	612	32	relationship_advice
My sister has been with her husband (26) for 8 years and married for 2.  Things started to go south when she got pregnant last February.  Her husband was always a sweet guy, a little arrogant but helpful and rational. However, when she got pregnant, he began arguing with her about little stuff and being really inconsiderate.  Now that the baby is here he is not helpful and is still super argumentative. \n Last week while she was holding the baby he started shouting at her about dirty dishes. She went upstairs to get away from him but he followed her up there. She put the baby down and he continued to shout and get in her face. She put her hands on his chest to keep some distance between them and then he shoved her to the floor. I am in shock. I never would have believed that he was capable of this but it's true. I know that he is also verbally abusive to her because their arguments are quite nasty. \n My sister has told me that she thinks she might be becoming depressed. My sister has never battled depression before. I can't stand to see her like this but I don't know what to do. I want to have someone beat her husband up, honestly. My mom always told me and my sister that if a man ever hit us we should leave him ASAP. But I know this is easier said than done. \n If anyone has any advice I would  really  appreciate it. I Know that counseling is an option but both of them are doctors doing their residency so their schedules are super crazy and they haven't found/made time for it. I think he specifically needs help because he lost his mom when he was young. What can I say to encourage them to get help? Should my sister just leave him? They have a 3 month old baby :-( Please please please help. Thank you all in advance. I can provide more details if necessary.	My sister's marriage has recently become abusive.

I have been with my boyfriend for about 4 months, and they have been hell and back. Although he is generally very generous, it is always held over my head in some manner if, for example, I want a weekend for myself. \n He has attachment issues, has much of his ex's stuff as well at his house which I knew from the beginning was a red flag and I should have bailed then. That is too late. \n We were supposed to spend Thursday night together because that was when I had work off, but a family emergency made it so I couldn't. I also recently moved to a new apartment to be closer to my job. Because I am so afraid he is going to go crazy when I break up with him, I was careful not to give him the address. \n I let him help me move. I kept all my most important things while he took my least important things with him (just in case I had to cut losses.)

He says okay, we would just exchange stuff. When he gets to my place I find out he doesn't have A SINGLE THING OF MINE. He says he will put it in his car if I come back with him. \n I reluctantly have managed to keep his important thing on the stipulation that he much bring my things. \n I guess the advice I would like is how to prevent him causing a scene at my new apartment, finding out where I live, or how I can even bring my stuff to my apartment without my car.

"So I'll try to keep this short. My ex girlfriend and I split up last in March. We dated for 4 years and she had/has some things to work through (not directly with me but other aspects of her life). Here's the issue: we teach a music class together. \n Initially she moved out and we didn't talk. She was being really irrational (I wasn't a saint either). She said she wanted to come back and teach this year (initially I was going to find someone else). I was getting facebook messages from her family (her cousin who she is close to) and she was bummed we were on a ""break"" and that my ex has been in a funk. Normally I would just try to move on and hopefully we would be able to work it out natrually but here is my bigger issue: \n She goes back and forth between rational and irrational (her cousin thinks she might have depression. I could see that but I'm not a Dr.). Normally I would just try to treat it like nothing was wrong and hope that she would see how well we get along and we would become closer again. I'm running into an issue though because she has skipped rehearsals the last few weeks and hasn't given me prior notice. I don't want to create more drama or have the first time I see her in a few weeks to be confrontational but I don't see how I can just let it go. I want things to be natural but I don't see a way around me having to confront her.

"which is blowjobs. Of course, he didn't tell me this, and after he initiated sex he just started acting really disinterested, pissed off, wouldn't even look at me (during sex). My feelings are hurt and I'm feeling pretty shitty. In the ensuing conversation (about how he's angry that I don't have a 6th blowjob sense), he proceded to blame me because he just ""wanted to get what he wanted"" and so on and so forth. I find his sense of entitlement a huge turn off. This kind of ""it's what I wanted"" attitude has been kind of an issue in other ways as well. He brought up how, as we were just starting to date, he didn't want it to get too serious because he was still interested in this other girl (I hadn't known this fully until recently), and wanted to leave his options open. \n Which is reasonable (enough), but this girl had told him multiple times that she wasn't interested. The whole situation is kind of awkward, as we go to a small LAC, so we see her around all the time and he's clearly not 100% over it.

"So, I've been hanging out with this girl the last little while. We get along super well, and to top it off there's definitely a lot of chemistry between us. My roommate described it as ""fireworks"", and most glaringly even I picked up, and I ALWAYS assume the worst. Here's where it gets tricky... I was informed she told me buddy and roommates gf/her roommate that she had a thing for me, so I made my intentions clear, but it made things even more murky.... \n I'm in narcotics anonymous and have been three months clean, whereas she's been clean for a bit over a year and a half. I brought up that I wanted to clarify what was going on via text, and she said she was wondering when it was going to come up, and that she had already talked to her sponsor about it and that she had been told that it would be morally wrong of her to get involved with someone this early in sobriety since it could jeopardize my staying in the program if stuff went wrong. I took this to be the NA version of ""I'm not looking for a relationship right now"" and gave up the ghost. We still talk and hangout on occasion afterwards but not nearly as much. I still sense something there and she always seems super nervous around me and I just assume I'm seeing what I want to see and ignore it. \n Skip forward to a few days ago, she asks if I want to go out for dinner and we do as such.

On the other I'm telling myself that she still seems interested, wanted to talk about it and is maybe not a lost cause. The recovery community is pretty small and she's my roommates girlfriends roommate so I'd have to see her at meetings and stuff all the time which would be pretty awkward if it turns out the shitty hunch is right.

We have plans etc,. but nothing is certain since we're young and we're still in college. \n We both spent the holidays with our family, so we're apart since Dec. 12.

A little backstory here, we've known each other since freshman year of high school and we've always been friends, but our senior year we really got to know each other a lot better. We both enjoyed volunteering at a local homeless shelter so we spent a large amount of time together getting to know each other better. She's had a boyfriend for the past two years who for all intents and purposes is a meh. His nickname throughout high school was buzz killington if that's any indication. He's not overly smart or overly anything for that matter, he doesn't really have many friends and she's the complete opposite of that. She's got just about every good quality that I could list, so in short she's really far out of his league. She's going places in life and he's just kind of dragging her down in everything. Now here's where I come in. Over the time we spent together we grew really close, but the part I wonder about is that if you're just friends with someone you tend to keep a certain degree of distance. She hasn't really given me that impression or any of those signs for that matter. Like the little stuff, if she's in a group of her friends and I happen to be there she talks to me the most, even more so than her bf. There's a whole host of other signs, but I'll spare the details. Now on the last day of our summer break before we went off to college I decided I couldn't keep my peace, so while we were volunteering I pulled her off the side and spoke to her in private and told her how I felt about her bf and how I didn't think he was right for her. I, however did not mention my romantic feelings for her but I'm sure she'd noticed by then. Her response was overwhelmingly positive, and she thanked me for my courage in speaking to her and telling her how I felt. We've stayed very close since then, but since we've gone off to college I'm beginning to wonder. She's given me all these signs, and eagerly stayed in touch, yet she's still with the other guy. I'm not sure whether to simply wait until she does something or to do something further. I should also mention we are attending different colleges that are about 2 hours from each other.

So basically my first gf cheated on my quite a bit with both guys and girls. Because of this I no longer trust guys or lesbians around my current gf, and have wanted to push them away because I don't want someone trying to break my SO and I up.

So I was wondering if you have any advice to give about not being so aggressive towards others in this situation? \n NOTE: My SO will tell them to stop and even walk away over to me.

We have been in this relationship for a year. Initially I initiated sex. But she was reluctant so we ended up with just blow jobs or hand jobs. I was horny all the time for at least the first 3/4 months. She was opposing it initially. And I felt guilty. So I stopped. \n This turned into a sexless relationship. The spark was gone. And I started treating her as an usual friend. Although in the eyes of others we were still committed. \n She brought up the issue that I have fallen out of love with her. It turned into an argument. And we decided on calling off our engagement too. We hadn't been engaged yet. But the engagement plans started getting crossed off. \n But the other day, she cried a lot. She told me I was the only one she loved. And her principles said, she would save herself for one guy and that I was the guy. \n No doubt, I like her. I like her as a friend. I really respect her. And in no way would I want to see her being sad. \n Then yesterday she came to my place. And she said she was ready for sex. She wanted to fix things. Fine. \n But then I felt that sexual attraction is no longer there. I couldn't feel it anymore. I tried fingering her. And she was giving in. But inside me, I didn't feel it anymore. \n This morning we had the talk. I told her I don't feel it anymore. She was then ready to call it off. She said without the sex things would be really sad. It's called off for the moment. \n But I feel sad for her. She loved me so much she tried. But I don't feel it anymore for her sexually. \n Am I in the wrong? Can this be fixed somehow? \n Does suppressing sexual desires initially in the relationship cause total loss of sexual attraction for the other person slowly with time? \n And yes, I want sex in my life.

"Hey guys/girls. \n I'm a 19 YO male with a lot of self confidence and I'm generally good with women. I usually am totally fine on my own and don't have to ask for advice. \n However, at this point I'm in unfamiliar territory and I'd like to get some advice. \n It started back in December when the new girl started at work. We hit it off almost immediately, definitely a lot of chemistry. I got her number and we texted back and forth a LOT. A ton of flirting and all that good stuff. \n When I got back from a trip after New Years, we started hanging out(smoking, just really chilling at her house) which eventually led to dates. We've went on five or six dates, and I took her out somewhere really nice for Valentine's Day. \n So at the end of the night on V-Day, we makeout as I'm leaving. So of course I'm thinking things are looking up at this point. \n So the past week or so, we haven't been texting as much. Which I'm fine with, everyone needs their space. We still text daily and there is still some definite flirting going on. She came over to a party on Saturday and there was no awkwardness and we had a good time, although we were never alone at any point so nothing happened there. \n So Monday of this week, I ask her when we'd be able to go out again, she says ""Probably going to be busy until Friday"". \n Cool, have a day in mind. Excited and what not. She went out with her friends Tuesday to the bars(she's over 21) and Wednesday she was at home studying for a test, no big deal. Today I figure she might be open tonight, as I asked her earlier and she had no plans. \n So I text her around 6(she's still at work at this point) asking what she's getting into. I get a text about 3 hours later about some unrelated, but seemed like a big enough story that would be annoying to text. I call her, ask what's up and get the story. \n I ask what she's doing, she says she's hanging out with a friend from work. I'm not generally the jealous type, so I'm unphased by it and ask if she wants to hang out later when they're done. \n ""Well, I'm not sure when I'm going to be home but I think [friend] is coming over later when he gets off work(another friend from work that I'm 100% sure she isn't interested in more than a friend)"". \n So I feel like she might be blowing me off. I'm 1000% cool with the fact that she's doing her own thing tonight, but with the combination of not talking as much lately and then making plans with TWO people(which I'm sure went down well after I asked) is making me super nervous. \n We spoke at work earlier for a bit and everything seemed cool, so I feel like a lot of this is in my head. \n So really, my main question is: \n Is it wrong for me to call her later and ask where we stand? I'd honestly rather just know ASAP. If she's still into me, awesome, fears alleviated. If she's not, I'd rather know now and not be in limbo. Would this freak you out, ladies? \n Not to mention the fact that I feel like I'm getting blown off has me super nervous for tomorrow..I know I should just ignore it tonight and wait and see how tomorrow goes...but I have a huge fucking pit in my stomach and I can't handle it."	What do you think about asking a girl where she sees it going after a few dates and a few months of hanging out?	607	24	relationship_advice
"Sorry if I mess something up, this is my first post EVER). So me and my girlfriend have been dating for around 8 months now.  We go to different colleges in the same state, so it's technically long distance but we're really only 45 minutes away from each other.  In the past I have joked around with her about cheating, but it's always been apparent that I was joking (or so I thought).  She has never been the type to party so tonight I decided to go out without her (like I usually do), and I told her ahead of time I would be going out, called her, and she said goodnight and everything. She texts me at around 1AM with this: ""[my name].. tell me the truth... How many times did you bring a girl to your dorm drunk and high, had sex with her, started going at it while your roommate was in the room, not remember anything happening because you blacked out and your roommate had to tell you the next day? How many times have you done this, but actually remember all this happening? I can't believe you..."" No she sometimes jokes with me, but seeing as we had already said goodnight for the day and the fact that this text gave off the 'specific situation' type vibe I decided to call her.  She doesn't answer the first few times so I text her and call again and she answers.  She seemed very unresponsive and claimed that everything was alright and kept trying to find excuses to go to bed or get off the phone.  I ask if she was joking with the text and she says no, but I got nowhere so I let her off the phone eventually.  I don't know what to do. It's sounds like she thinks I'm cheating but I just have no idea where all this came from!"	Girlfriend of 8 months sent me a random text possibly claiming I'm cheating without and hints of why she'd jump to that conclusion.	318	23	relationship_advice
"I've been friends with ""M"" for about a year. We are med students, and we both belong to a tight knit group that spends most of its waking hours together studying, drinking, and hanging out. So as a result we were already very close and comfortable with each other, we had even shared a bed several times before without anything sexual happening. The other friends had told me many times that he had a thing for me, but I was put off by the fact that he can be a bit intense sometimes , while I'm very easy-going. And also because I was too busy playing ""grab-ass"" with his best friend in the group (that's one for another day, but we've both come to the realization that nothing will happen because he has a serious girlfriend. There is still a strong attraction between us though). \n Fast forward a few months, M asks me to be his date to a wedding, as friends. I accept, because, uh, free booze. I went with the expectation that nothing would happen, that we would drink, dance, and have a good time together as we had many times in the past. However, this was my first real wedding as a ""grown-up."" It stirred up feelings that I had not expected. For female med students especially, it is hard to find the time to meet guys, let alone find one that is okay with being second to your studying and knowing that you will likely out-earn them by a large margin. A few beers deep, I express this to M. He confesses he has similar worries, as he would like to have his first child before 30. We make a lighthearted My Best Friend's Wedding style deal to get married if we're still single by 30. Fast forward a few more hours, we return to the hotel room after a fun night, both of us the perfect level of drunk. He makes a move. I resist initially, worried about how it would affect the dynamic of our group. He promises that there are no strings attached, that it won't be awkward, and that he'll still be my friend no matter what. I know that a guy in his position would say just about anything, but I believe him. We have sex (twice) and it is fantastic. We go again in the morning, and again in the shower. \n Fast forward a few weeks to present day (sorry this is getting long...). We have been sleeping together almost every night since the wedding. True to his word, I don't feel pressured into anything, we are ""out"" to the group and everything has been going surprisingly well. We even had a little double date with the friend I mentioned before and his gf. It seems everything is falling into place for us to become a couple. I can tell he is feeling me out but trying to play it cool, making jokes about how I'm going to drop him, playfully avoiding giving me back my earrings because it would be an excuse for me to come back ""after this stops"". The thing is, I really like hanging out with him (and I REALLY enjoy the sex). We are already so comfortable with each other that it feels like we've been together for years. But that's the thing...I don't really get excited about seeing him, or him being my boyfriend. It's just kind of like, ""oh, yeah that would be nice"". I feel like I got cheated out of the butterflies and excitement that comes with a new relationship. I've been in relationships almost continuously for the past 6 years, and I don't want to start another one unless I'm completely sure of it. I also don't want to keep leading him on and possibly hurt him. What do?"	"Started a FWB relationship in a very tight knit group of friends. It's been chill so far, he most likely wants more.

We've been married for 6 years now, and have a 2 year old son. He's never seen this behavior and I never want him to. This has happened in the past but its been happening more and more frequently. At first one every 1 year to 9 months, now it seems about once every 1-2 months. Last night she had two episodes. This happens after we have a big argument, which is often over nothing. I refuse to back down because I think she is being childish, then things just get worse. \n Yesterday we argued twice over the dumbest thing. First, we were sitting down for lunch and I was at the computer. She asked if I would stop and sit down with my son. (Obviously this is a normal request on her part and I should be with him but I just wanted to wrap something up.) \n I said just a second. Then she asked again about 10 seconds later. I said just a second. Again she asked about 10 seconds later. I snapped, raised my voice, and said let me just finish. Honestly it was dickish on my part but I lost my cool, but that was it. She was smoldering angry and we sat in silence the entire lunch. \n This is very typical, sometimes its more or less worse on my part, but ultimately I generally think its things that a normal person would brush off but she stays angry for 1-2 hours for these types of things. \n Anyways, losing my cool and being frustrated with these types of incidents I refused to back down and told her I'm tired of it. I explained my point of view that we shouldn't even be arguing but things just got worse and worse. Voice were raised until eventually we weren't talking again. Moments later she began slapping herself and crying hysterically. \n After 3 or so hours she calmed down, we apologized, and talked. Later that night a similar incident occurred. She made a condescending comment about our sex. It was one of those I'm joking but I'm not joking jokes. I can't remember what it came from, and of course I was offended. She refused to apologize and then became hysterical again when I stayed angry. This time was even worse, she slapped herself, banged her head against the wall, and was flicking her eyes. \n Sometimes this behavior is brought on by bigger arguments, but lately its been from smaller things. Sometimes the arguments are brought on by me being a jerk but even still I don't think this behavior is warranted. Typically its something small, she's upset because I'm upset, she stays angry and refuses to talk to me for 30 minutes to an hour, I get upset and tell her this is not normal, she gets even more upset, there's yelling, then hitting herself. \n I really don't know what to do, I don't want to think about divorce but its definitely what keeps coming to mind.	My wife and I often have arguments over small stuff. She stays angry for abnormally long amounts of time, 30 minutes to an hour, I get upset, she gets even more upset, there's yelling, then she begins to hit herself.	499	40	relationship_advice
There's an attractive girl at my school, and I'm considering asking her out, but there's a lot of reasons that make me too scared to. \n I have a fat fetish, I've known about it since I was around 13. I'm not exclusively into fat, I find thin girls attractive too, sometimes, but I would prefer a larger girlfriend. I don't have any real preferences for weight, since there's a lot more that it takes for me to find someone attractive, but generally, bigger is better. The girl in question here is, by my guess, around 300 pounds. Give or take maybe 25. I find her incredibly attractive, and when I see her in the halls at school, I find my eyes drawn towards her huge, fat stomach, butt, and thighs. I am very tempted to ask her out, but there's a lot of things that are making me unsure and scared about doing it. \n First off, and probably the biggest thing is I'm scared about my parents. I would ideally try to keep this a secret (I would keep any romantic relationship secret from them regardless.). But, if they find out that I have a thing for a girl about 3 times my weight, they're going to know something's up and might find out about my fetish, which I never want to happen. They're also very immature, invasive and judgmental, so that would obviously cause problems. My brother and a lot if his friends also go to my school, and if he finds out, he'll tell my parents and they'll know, so even if I do get together with her, I wouldn't be able to hang out with her at school or something, and with winter coming, I won't be able to go many places. \n Then, I'm also worried about what her reaction would be when she finds out about my fetish, which would inevitably happen at some point or another. Either she'll figure it out, or I could tell her. I'm thinking I could avoid all that from the beginning by telling her that I have a thing for bigger girls, or having my friend tell her. But, that would mean I tell my secret to my only friend, and the only person outside of reddit who would know, and there's no telling how she would react. And if I tell her from the beginning, that could drive her away immediately. \n And finally, I have an internal ethical struggle about all this. I always have about this fetish. The thing is, there's no denying that obesity is unhealthy, but I can't help but become aroused by it. So, I worry that if I get together with her, I might have a negative impact on her health by having the fetish, and with her already being so large. \n Oh, and did I mention I know nothing about her? There's that, too. Which makes me worried that I might only be interested in her because of my fetish.\nI don't know who else to turn to about this, and need help.	I'm scared to ask out a girl I have a minor crush on because my parents are jerks, and I have issues with a fetish of mine and am scared she might, too.	510	33	relationship_advice
"for all intents and purposes, the advice i'm requesting here is about my first ""real"" relationship (6 months long) \n i'll be starting dental school in the fall which will be a 5 hour drive away. i'll be getting a place down there, and don't anticipate having very much free time to come back home other than major holidays and MAYBE a long weekend every once in a while. i definitely care a lot about this girl, but quite honestly have no idea whether or not i'm in love with her. this upcoming change has been weighing heavily on me, and i get the feeling that she's been thinking a lot about it as well. i know that at some point we need to talk about it, i'm just not quite sure how to proceed. \n i'd be lying if i said i was at all optimistic about a long distance relationship lasting four years while she waits for me to finish dental school on the other side of the state. this feeling that the relationship will eventually come to an end has me quite torn. \n from a selfless perspective, i feel like i should make it clear to her soon rather than later that i don't see this relationship lasting very far into dental school so she can make her own decision one way or another. \n from a selfish perspective, i want to keep the relationship going until dental school starts and give the long distance thing a try, even if for a short while. \n at the end of the day, i know that in order for me to not feel like a scumbag, i need to at the very least tell her that i'm skeptical about long term relationships but that i'm willing to give it a try. \n i'd love to hear some feedback/advice on my thought process here, and if anyone has dealt with a similar type of issue, i'd love to hear about how you managed."	relationship is about to become long distance (5hr drive) \n-i'm skeptical of it working for 4 years of dental school \n-what do i tell her?	328	25	relationship_advice

Now all of a sudden, Fran and Abby are the duo to be reckoned with. We all hung out earlier today and they were discussing their plans to go out later tonight. I kept silent until Fran asked me ""Are you coming?"" I hemmed and hawed, because I didn't want to seem too gung-ho about a plan I wasn't even made aware of, and wasn't explicitly invited to.

"My boyfriend won't have sex with me pretty much unless I beg for it. I don't act very clingy but I make it quite obvious that I am down for sex anytime, anywhere, and am down to try new things. But quite frankly, our sex life is boring. Maybe once a week, once every other week, give or take. In bed, at the last possible moment before falling asleep. He claims that he drinks too much and can't get a boner, and he's embarrassed about it. Also he states he has a low sex drive and can't help that he doesn't really want to have sex. Yet for some reason, he loves to stay up late and watch/look at porn. Nine times out of ten, when I am tired and go to bed, he'll be staying up to watch porn etc. Just tonight I was flirting/coming on to him over the course of the day, and then we had some drinks this evening, and I was rejected many times. I went to bed and he went on my computer and I come back out to get a glass of water and lo and behold he's watching porn, again, then gets mad at me for coming out of the bedroom. Throws a fit that I am trying to ""supervise him"" and how I automatically assume he's up to no good, which really upsets me because it's my apartment, my computer, and I have stressed many times to not watch porn on my computer, and if he is horny, he is more than welcome to come join me for a fuck. Basically, my question is... Is this normal? In my opinion, my sex life is lacking. I have made it clear that I want and need more action, and have brought it up in conversation many times over the years we've been together. It's a lot worse lately. How should I react? How should I approach the situation? Is there anyone who can give me some feedback and advice?"

We have been on and off for the past year, due to too many things to write down, so I'll focus on what happened last night. \n Back story - We have been back together for about 2 months. Everything has been great except Thursday night she said she was invited to a Christmas Party from the owner of the gym I go to? Supposedly he's 50+, but I can't understand why she would accept. Anyway, I explained to her if I was invited by an older women or any women to a party, she would flip out. She argued with me until she was blue on Thursday. I let the case rest because I figured A) she's going to go B) she will decide it isn't such a good idea to go. \n Flash forward to Friday night: I get out, I ask her if she's going to be MIA... sure enough no response to that question, but she continues messaging. I ask again. No response to my question. Since I had a busy night, I wasn't worried (family in town, bestfriends birthday, work in the morning - she does as well - mind you I invited her to come with me to all mentioned events.) Anyway, she texts me at 9? Saying she wants to be with me/this and that... I call her at 10 because I just noticed my phone as I was on my way to my friends birthday. I call her about 3-5 times, she doesn't answer. I send a few messages about my where-abouts, and how I'll see her tomorrow. She messages me at roughly 1150 pm est, saying I should basically stay home and she'll see me tomorrow. (I was already asleep by this message) Anyway, I woke up to a few more messages, like her saying she was excepting me to be at her place? I didn't know she would stay out until 2-3am since she works at 6 am (as a nurse mind you)... I see she posted on facebook where she was, so I called this morning asking her why she didn't answer my call or messages... She's at work so she can't really talk. \n I messaged her and basically said -- I had messaged/call all night, you weren't asleep, you could have answered or said something. I wasn't mad, just bothered haha. She messaged saying she'll call me at lunch so all I asked was who she went with... since I think I should know who she's going out with and it shouldn't be a problem, right? I know I should trust her, but with the past history and going to a random party with a random guy (which I'm not sure happened, but I could easily find out who the owner/whether or not there was a party indeed...) She flipped out... and said I should FUCK OFF and this and that... and I should respect her. Mind you I didn't say anything other than what I just posted to you guys...

"So I've been seeing this guy since the beginning of August. We got along great right away/lots in common and had sex on the second date.

Obvious throwaway here, ex browses reddit. \n So a little backstory here... \n I [19M] just recently broke up with my SO [19F] of almost a year this past Sunday, let's call her Allison. It was something that we both saw coming so it wasn't a shock to either of us. We agreed that we wanted to end things before we started to nitpick each other and go down a road that would end up in us not having a good relationship in the future. Since it has only been a little while since the break up obviously things are still in the awkward faze but we still talk and are trying to build a good relationship as friends (i know some people say this doesn't work but we were friends before the relationship and it was a healthy relationship so we saw no reason to not try). \n What she doesn't know is that part of the reason I wanted to end things was because I began to develop feelings for her roommate, also [19F] that we are both mutual friends with and we all met last year. Obviously I didn't want to be a scum bag and try to spider-man my way onto another relationship so we ended things on good terms. The only problem is that my feelings for her roommate, we'll call her Melissa, have grown since I thought about breaking up with Allison and have intensified since the breakup. \n In addition to this, it was pointed out to me by one of our mutual friends that Melissa and I had looked like we had been flirting a lot, from both sides. It was also brought to my attention that Melissa's friends think she's attracted to me to. \n The problem is that Melissa and Allison are roommates, thus is the name of the title, the roommate switch. I talked to my dad about it, and he said I was crazy to even consider doing it because I would probably end up getting slapped by both parties. I'm not sure what my next move should be or if I should even pursue Melissa, but I have really felt a strong attraction growing for her and I don't see that changing in the near future, especially since she is showing it back to me. \n This is why I come to you /r/relationship_advice.

"Hello, good folks. \n I've been lurking this sub for the past hour, and have found similar posts that relate to my circumstance, but I figured I should present my own story for more specific feedback. \n I have been dating this amazing girl for about 16 months, now. For the first year, it was perfection. The passion, the transparency... it was all better than one could hope for. We overcame hurdles together, and always found ourselves closer after every one. \n But about 4 months ago, it was time for her to graduate university (I'm far past graduated, and half a year into my career). She had been in school every year since kindergarten, and she was quite obviously peering over the precipice into a life without the structure that she's always known. Change is upon her. And with it, her passion for our relationship has suffered. \n She became distant, and began to lack any apparent sex-drive. Her stress, as well as her old anxiety (which I was credited for quelling early in the relationship), rose up fast. It was an unspoken issue for a while. But recently, we've been talking about it. \n She says that she doesn't know how she feels about me anymore, but that she doesn't feel the same as she once did. She always adds that she doesn't know where she's going in life, and attributes her constant need for independent social environments (which she always had before) to her pursuit of learning who she is as an individual. And I get that. But it's as if the rare times that I'm actually invited to participate in a social gathering with her is almost out of courtesy. And the few nights a week that I am allowed to spend at her place (which used to be most nights) have this deafening void filling the room, as if the 3 feet between us were miles. She consciously ignores/postpones responding to many of my texts when we're apart, yet she's never like that with anyone else. I know it's the basis of giving her space, but I feel that she's floundering in it, as opposed to being constructive with it. \n She has entertained the notion that it is due to the changes in her life outside the relationship, but the ever-returning conclusion is always ""I just don't know."" She has started to see a psychologist, as her own reach for answers. But so far, its still a stalemate. \n Soooooo it's a bit of a conundrum. \n Does spending time with other people (SO or otherwise) really teach you about who you are, or is it a grand distraction from resolving true inner conflict? Is it fair for me to feel hurt by her willing dismissal of communication with me? How much space/torture should I accept before I should consider drastic actions? \n I still love her insanely, and am willing to keep giving her space, but it's taking it's toll on me. If any of you kind souls might have some constructive insight into this, I would be happy to hear it. \n Thanks."

"Hey, ya'll. \nThrowaway account so my Redditor boyfriend won't see. \n BF and I have been dating for 10 months. We're totally in love, and I could actually see myself ending up with him for keeps. \n He's a 3rd year med student, going to school 3 hours away from me. We started dating during his Xmas break last year, and have been long-distance ever since. Except for a few month-long rotations he's been able to land in my city, we generally see each other two weekends per month. \n BF lives with two classmates and has a large group of med school friends. They often do things in big groups--intramural leagues, parties, dinners, etc. BF's default state is communal--that is, every dinner is prepared or procured with roommates and/or other friends, and pretty much every night people are over at his place eating, drinking, tv watching, etc. When I come to visit, it's always ""everyone's doing this,"" or ""what does everyone want to do?"" I can count on one hand the number of times we've done something independently, or made our own plans separate from the group. Even if we're just chilling out watching tv, there are at least two other people on the couch. \n I love his friends--but with the small amount of time we get together, I crave one-on-one time. A date, a night in alone, whatever. For me, it's a no-brainer, especially in a LDR. \n Most recent incident: We'd talked generally about doing a couple's costume for Halloween, and about me visiting him this weekend. I've had a rough couple of weeks and really need some ""OP & OP's BF Time,"" and have expressed recently how much I miss him and how difficult it is being apart.\nYesterday, when I confirmed I was coming, it was ""Great-- be thinking of a large group costume idea for 10 or so people. We're all dressing up and going to the  __  concert. We can all discuss it on Friday night, then you guys can get the stuff ready while I work a 12-hour shift on Saturday before the party."" It left me feeling...exasperated. \n I've tried expressing my need for quality time, and I've tried suggesting couple activities, but it hasn't changed...more than that, I want him to  want  one-on-one time as well, you know? I'm not sure what to do anymore-- do I stop visiting as much?"	Long-distance BF includes roommates/friends in all of the limited time we get together.	396	13	relationship_advice
This is a self-post, so I'm not going for karma here, just need to hear some words of wisdom or support, I guess. I'm practically in tears at work today and need to get this off my chest. I can't unload on my best friend because she hates my bf and isn't able to offer an unbiased ear.\nIt's not abusive situation, really, but I realized that my bf doesn't respect me and I'm pretty sure he no longer wants me around and is manipulating things so I'm the one to break up with him instead of him growing a pair and standing up for himself. \nI've tried sitting down with him, asking what's on his mind and why does it feel like all of the silences between us are awkward. He flies into a rage and starts yelling and cursing (I just leave the room and refuse to engage when that happens) or he gets quiet and acts like he's so tired that he's falling asleep. \nWe live together and I don't have enough savings to move out for at least a month and a half, realistically two months.  I know he hates having me live with him, I moved in about two months ago when I lost my job and my lease ended, but I\u2019ve found a job (better $  than before, too) and have been making plans to move out. He said he understood that I wasn't able to move out immediately, it might take three months or so. Lately, though, he's not even trying to make the best of a bad situation, and when he's not ignoring me outright or dodging my questions, he just sits around and refuses to say anything at all. \nI\u2019m a talker. When I have a problem or a hang-up, I want to talk about it. If I keep things bottled up inside, my thought patterns turn in circles and I don\u2019t make any progress working them out. Apparently, though, to him, me talking things out is just noise. Or, if I express a preference for something, he takes it that I\u2019m demanding it, no matter how many times I clarify that it\u2019s a preference, not an order. I don\u2019t know how to handle that and it\u2019s incredibly frustrating. \nIf I ask a question, it\u2019s an accusation, no matter how innocent. And then he accuses me of being passive aggressive. \nI\u2019ve always thought I was assertive, not aggressive, and not passive-aggressive. When he accuses me of being passive-aggressive, I have no idea what to say to that. I\u2019m not going around the house, huffing and puffing and giving the silent treatment, I\u2019m not messing with his possessions and making him guess at what\u2019s upsetting me. I\u2019m trying to tell him, as directly as possible, that I\u2019m unhappy and that I need certain things from him to try and remedy the situation. And all I get are accusations of being accusatory, demanding, and ungrateful in return. I\u2019m done, I\u2019m so over it that I\u2019m literally moving all of my belongings into his basement, where I\u2019ll live until I can move out. \nAnd it sucks, because in almost 15 years of dating, he\u2019s the only person I\u2019ve ever even fantasized about getting married to.	passive agressive bf accusses me of being passive agressive, then ignores me by pretending to fall asleep when I try to have a direct talk.	541	25	relationship_advice
"edit: POUTS not Puts \n So basically I work an evening job and she works during the day. We both work long hours, but when I get home she's almost ready for bed and I'm kind of still geared for another 2 hours of lounging. Anyways, she'll say she wants to ""hangout, talk, have sex"" but she's just sleeping on the couch next to me dozing on and off, and when I'm like ""OK, I'm ready to sleep"" She starts pouting, i.e. turns away, mumbles incoherently, silent treatment. \n I'm sorry but her sleeping on the couch and pouting does not turn me on and I don't want to have sex. So we argue about it. Or she starts pouting and I say ""I can't understand you, you're mumbling and I'd like to actually have a conversation."" And so then I just want to sleep, and then she's like NO! Let's talk about it. \n I'm kind of just getting tired of it, and I don't feel as attracted to her anymore.

My girlfriend and I have been together almost two years now, all has been well and dandy until I joined the Marine Corps. My girlfriend supported me the whole time along with my family and together they made me feel like I could do anything, until recently that is. \n My mother and my girlfriend have always been friendly to one another going as far as becoming pretty much best friends. After I left for Bootcamp and MCT then to my final schooling for some reason they had a falling out and everything has turned to complete shit. \n My mother used to be a big drug addict and abusive since I was a child and my girlfriend likes to bring up this fact all of the time. Her and my mother were best friends and now she accuses my mother of harassing her because she misses her friend. At the same time my mother accuses my girlfriend of stealing me (her little boy) away from her since my mother and I don't talk much due to our past. \n What hurts the most is the way they both bicker and smack talk about one another and it is hard to take sides when one is family and the other is love. I'm at the end of my rope with them both and my best thought was to throw my hands up and tell them both to go away, but I know that wouldn't be the best of options. \n I try to explain to my mother that I am not in a relationship with her, while simultaneously attempting to explain to my girlfriend that she is talking bad about my mother to her dang son! I have lost complete control of the situation at this point. My girlfriend constantly fights with me about damn near everything ever since this started whereas my mother has become a basket case. \n I'm losing both of them at this rate and I really need some help making this situation better.

"My boyfriend and I have been dating for only two months. It doesn't seem like that long (because it isn't), but we have gotten very close very quickly. We spend every night together, switching off between our apartments. We shower together, eat breakfast together before work, everything. We both value honesty and communication, so we are able to talk about everything that's on our minds. We're obviously still in a honeymoon phase, but we are so incredibly compatible that I can see us potentially going the distance. He feels the same way. \n We have already discussed living together. My lease ends in 6 months,  but I hate my apartment (my neighbors are loud, it's not that close to where I work, etc). His apartment is awesome - it's the same price as mine, but it's bigger, has thicker walls, and is closer to work. \n My current line of thinking is that I could end my lease early and move in with him and just see how it goes. I don't think that moving in together will change our relationship in any way, since we would be spending that time together anyway. And if we break up for whatever reason, I can always move out and find a new place. Money is not an issue here, since we both have good-paying jobs. \n As a side note, I have lived with a boyfriend before, and it went great. I am pretty low maintenance, and the guys I date are too, so living together was just like having an awesome roommate, and only had positive effects on the relationship. Our breakup was in no way related to the fact that we lived together. \n When I think about moving in with him, I get excited. He does too. But when I think objectively about ""moving in with a guy after 8 weeks"" I feel insane. What say you, reddit?"

Preface: I know you guys advise against a lot of these situations, because the people in question are at very different stages in their life. I'm not in high school, though, I'm going to a community college full time. \n I met this guy when we were in an English class together, and have known him for a couple of months. I didn't think of him as anything but a friend until lately. . .we're not in the same class anymore, but we see each other before my class and after his, for about an hour a day total. It's probably just my imagination, but I feel like we're being a little more flirty than, well, ever. I really do hope he likes me, but at the same time I'm positive my parents would kill us both (metaphorically speaking, of course) if they found out. Where we're at   right now is actually really good, and I don't want it to evolve into more, at least right now. Am I handling this situation okay? We're going to the same University soon (he's going after this year, I'm going year after next) and I thought that, considering I'll be eighteen when we see each other again, that if I still feel this way things will be different.

Me and my girlfriend have been in a relationship for 5 months now and there's been no sex. The first month we used to do kinky stuff daily and what not and then it slowed down to only when we were alone so it was fine.Then it went to like once every two weeks we would maybe do something and now It's been a little over two months since we've done anything apart from a small kiss on the lips. I am currently very happy with our relationship and I know she truly cares about me but I'm just confused... am I not turning her on anymore? I know that she has Oligomenorrhea and she doesn't get her period except maybe like once a year.I know she's supposed to take BC pills but I'm not sure if she still does so that may be the issue but otherwise she does have somewhat of a low self esteem\nbut I don't think that can be the only reason for it.

About 2.5 years ago my ex of 4 years broke up. We met in college and had been through so much together - basically watched each other grow up through such a crucial time in life (college -> real world). I've dated other girls in the interim but I never really got serious with any of them.. usually I would come up with some excuse why we'rent right for each other but the truth is she's never really left my mind. I think deep in my gut I always thought we were salvageable, and now for some reason I feel as though I want to tell her how I feel.. Probably because I am alone at the moment and there's less complications to the situation (i.e. another girl I'd need to break up with). \n Seems pretty clear what I need to do, only one problem. I am deeply conflicted about it. I am so afraid of it not working out again, wasting more time, getting hurt, hurting her (again)... some days i think 'shes my ex for a reason', while other days I think 'shes my soulmate and no one will ever get me like she does'. \n The reasons for breaking up were mostly on me. We met when i was 18 and by the time 23 rolled around I wanted to be free and branch out a bit more.. i distanced myself from her and she began to think i was cheating. I wasn't physically cheating, but talking to other girls (some might say that's emotionally cheating?) and going out without her more. She would go through my cell phone and emails which pissed me off and we began to mistrust each other, so we called it off. \n The truth was she was always so special to me.. I see now after being alone that it may have been wrong of me to let her slip away and throw out such a good thing.. we really worked so well for so long and I've yet to discover love again.. Probably because she's always there. Not a day goes by where I don't think about her. \n I really want to tell her how I feel.. and at the same time I'm so scared to. We talk occasionally but its mostly small talk and I usually get the feeling from her curt responses like she's moved on / doesn't want to see me. I almost want to do it if for nothing else so she can tell me she's done with me and I can truly begin the painful process of moving on... \n Again, its been 2.5 years and I probably should be over her but I'm not - its pathetic and I have to do something about it but I'm really not sure what to do. \n Edit-	Not sure whether to meet up or reconnect with an ex of 4 years.. been apart 2.5 years.	467	18	relationship_advice
"We have been friends for a few years and slowly I have started to realize that she has very low self-esteem. She always gets involved with people who are unavailable to her, and they usually cheat on their partner and use her for sex and emotional support, and she says these men are the only people who put her first so she needs to stay with them.

Lately she has gotten involved with another guy, and she says they are in love but he had said he will not break up with his gf for her. \n I know this is awful for her.

But lately that is all she will talk about and has stopped asking me questions about myself. I tried to bring this up with her and she kept driving the conversation back to this guy she is seeing. After an hour of trying to talk about it calmly with her I turned back to the state of our friendship and she refused to hear what I was saying. I shouldn't have done this but I got a bit angry and told her to stop complaining all of the time. She storms off and I follow her, confused about why she looks  incredibly  upset and why she refuses to listen. She says that the last time someone told her to stop complaining she started cutting herself. I was immediately apologetic, I didn't mean to trigger her, and realized she was beyond reasoning so continued to apologize and assure her that I do want to be there for her, she just needs to be in a two-sided friendship with me. She then says that she doesn't want to hear from me for a while and that we're still friends but I should talk to her in a few days. I agreed, she should call me when she was ready, and apologized again. She then insisted that I should be the one to call, and left. \n I feel like there is nothing I can do to convince her, help her, or even have a friendship anymore.

I'll obviously need to speak with her in a few days and gently ask how she is, apologize for snapping at her.

I've been cheated on before and I know how much guilt a person can suffer because they think they were cheated on due to the thought that they were not good enough. \n Backstory : My ex and I were best friends for a couple of years and then fell in love. However, we had an obstacle between us: 3000 miles to be exact. \n I have issues regarding commitment but decided to take the long-distance plunge because, hey, I was in love with her.

I missed the physical parts of being a boyfriend-- not necessarily sex, but I missed the PDA, the dinner dates, the driving aimlessly through the night just talking. \n I met a girl and decided to ask her out on a date. I deeply missed going on dates, and it felt rejuvenating. The girl and I had chemistry and we ended up kissing. Not making out, just kissing.

That wasn't the case at all, but I couldn't tell her since it sounded like I was just trying to cover my ass. \n I really want to tell her what happened, but I'm afraid it might come off as a sob story to get her back. \n What do I do?	cheated on my girlfriend.

"I originally saw her on Tinder, but I'm not sure how serious she was on that app.  She said in the description ""doing it for the lolz"", so yeah.  But I knew her from high school.  She goes to a college in my city and I go to the other big one in the city.  We had never talked before whatsoever, but we had some mutual friends.  I told a friend of mine that I saw her on Tinder, and he starts describing her which raises a lot of interest for me in her.  We share a lot of similar interests in music for example and she sounded cool, plus I found her really attractive. \n Another mutual friend of mine suggests I just message her on Facebook and tell her I'd like to get to know her, so I do that.  She said she's down to meet new people, so I got her to get lunch the next Saturday, which was today.  During the week, I start texting her a bit and learn more about her, and I find that we mesh very well personality wise too.  At this point, my only concern is her physical attraction to me. \n We had lunch today and then cupcakes for dessert afterwards, which a friend of mine told me she loves.  The ride there and the eating were alright.  Overall I was disappointed by the lunch date though.  There weren't too too many awkward silences and she seemed interested in things I talked about and I was interested in what she talked about too.  But I dunno.  Maybe it didn't help that we had never actually talked in person ever before and only had started talking earlier in the week. \n At the end when I was about to drop her off at her dorm, I asked her if she was free to hang out next weekend.  She quickly said she didn't know, said it was nice meeting you and left.  I said a few moments before that I hope she enjoyed hanging out and she said she did.

"Ok, the setting to this story is a little strange, please bear with me. \n I am in my second (almost third) year of having completely departed ""city life"" for a rural, ""farmy"" existence.  I was raised in the suburbs and I could go on about what brought me to this, but to put it short: I'm currently working and living full-time on a cattle ranch in the US Mountain West.  I've been here for only two months. And yeah, I'm a real cowgirl, basically. \n Work days are long and I'm surrounded by only a handful of people: my kind, intelligent boss and his artist wife, my coworker/housemate (a true John Wayne cowboy with whom I can barely hold a conversation) and then ...there's my neighbor.  He works with us occassionally/borrows equipment/is very friendly.  He too was raised a suburbs kid, and has only been living out here for a year and a half.  He and his business partner have been developing a really interesting small model for dealing with excess/landfill-bound nonperishable food from a nearby metro area via composting/growing food and raising chickens/pigs -- the model happens to be the small farm where he lives, three miles down the road from me.   Yes, it's all quite romantic. \n There are literally no other people around us for sixty or so miles.  No bars, no clubs, no malls, not even a gas station for 30 miles.  He's 31 and single, three years out of an eight year relationship that ended with a broken engagement.  Is he running from that, you ask? He has just short of downright admitted it, so I think yes. \n We come from a very similar family life/background, get on great, and he is an amazing person in every way I could possibly imagine.  We have fantastic conversations, make each other laugh, share a hugely important personal philosophy -- and lately he's been putting on the touchy-feely quite a bit: when he says hello, it has recently evolved from a short side-hug to an extended  gesture of back caresses and pulling me into him, and lots of flirty/suggestive humor. \n There's a notable age-gap, however.  Also, he is clearly gun-shy from his last (and only noteworthy, long-term) relationship.  We are totally isolated socially, and kind of each other's only real friend out here. \n Just for consideration, I think it's fair to say that are both above-average in attractiveness for our respective age groups. \n What's the right move on my part?"

my wife and I have been married for over 10 years, and we are young (28F and 30M). We have always had our issues and mostly stem down to her family problems growing up and my family problems that never existed until she came along. \n Most of the problems with my family is that I tried to please everyone and she saw me as always doing what they wanted and not what she wanted, this caused friction and now its always awkward when we see them. \n However, the problems started affecting me in the bedroom because during all of this she had depression and violent mood swings and I got the be the receiver of all this. \n Over the years we had always worked out that her problems stem from her family. While we talk, not matter what stared the problem it always ended back on her family, but now the blame has somehow shifted to me. \n Now, I don't know if I have lost an attraction for her due to copping abuse over and over again OR for any other reason, but I just cant seem to get that spark back and make things right. \n We both have spoken and want the same thing, we want everything to be back how it was and for the strong love to be back solidly between us. \n I am trying hard to be positive and keep things alive yet I don't feel anything back from her and the problem is that she wants ME to do most of the work seeing as she holds grudges and kinda blames me for letting it get so bad. \n I have reasoned with her about the fact that if we both want it we both need to put in the effort, but I just don't see it and I'm at a loss. \n I know that if I just bite the bullet and smother her with love that it will all work out, but I just cant find the love right now. \n She does have her depression under control except for these little moments of stress/attacks, but years ago I could just look past it. I cant seem to do that now, even though I want to. \n Does anyone have any advice on how to put the past behind me and block out any negative depressive mood swings that happen and just see my baby for who she really is?	How do I ignore depressive out bursts from my wife and see the person who I love? If its even possible.	403	21	relationship_advice
Been at Reddit for a year, but needed a throwaway for this one so pardon the lack of account history.  To me (22M) it hasn't been anything significant, only 6 months.  But my (19F) girlfriend has a completely different mindset.  She has been through some sure enough shit.  At 15 she was raped and didn't have the common sense to pursue a criminal charge, not that that helps the emotions.  She also has been in a couple relationships where guys have lied and been found to be out with other girls.  Then I come along, not to brag but honestly I'm a gentleman compared to her past, which I believe is why she is so attached.  She asks if I want to marry her someday and I lie because I don't want to tear her nerves up.  That has probably been my biggest mistake.  However there are just too many issues for me to attempt to mend and I am just going to have to end it. \n I'm planning on picking her up after work today and bringing her along to my cat's vet visit, she has always enjoyed that.  Upon dropping her off at her house I'm going to just be as honest as I can.  I don't want to be in a relationship anymore, mention all of the issues that are too much to work on.  Try to not be too brief but get her to hear it all out in an acceptable amount of time.  I've tried to work this around her being around friends and family immediately after so she isn't lonely, her mother is off of work on Fridays and there is a family reunion for her father and uncle that have returned from Iraq on Saturday.  I'm going to message her friends she has drifted away from while she has been caught up with me and ask them to reconnect to keep her busy. \n I've never broken up with anyone so sticking tough with the plan and not caving is going to be a task.  I've always been the quiet guy everyone likes so I'm also having a little trouble with the fact there are going to be a fair amount of people that won't care too much for me once I do this.  I still care for her happiness which is why I'm writing all of this so any help is appreciated. \n So saying all of that:\nIs there anything wrong with this plan?\nIs there anything I can do to make sure she won't do anything harmful to herself?\nAnything else you can think of?

"Hi Reddit. I know there are about ten million posts about this.. especially here. But I'm hoping for some very specific help. I [21/F] have been dating my boyfriend (22/M) for three and a half years and he is well and truly my best friend. In fact, we have been best friends for about 6 years, with him telling me he liked me every so often (when drunk, of course), and then we finally got together. We found it so awkward transitioning from friends to dating but soldiered through and were really happy in our relationship. We have not spent a night apart in three years and since we were best friends from the beginning - we had all of the same friends so never felt we needed time apart. \n We had fights every so often (he would get drunk and upset me etc) but we would always sort it out. Until a few nights ago when I got upset thinking about how this slut was all over him on the weekend (he knew she was a slut) and he didn't avoid it. It was just another of our small fights but I could feel he was holding something back. So i pushed him and pushed him and about half an hour later he said that he ""didn't feel that way"" anymore, but didn't even realize until I made him think about it. Long story short - he said we could still try, and then the next day said he had thought about it and said his mind will never change so there is no point. I get that he did that for me (obviously not to keep stringing me along if he never thought things could get better), but when we came over later he said he loved me. As a friend of course. Fuck me, right! \n A day of crying and he messages me saying ""you're still my best friend so do you want to go for dinner tomorrow night?"". Of course I do. I still love him and he knows. But I'm just confused because he said we needed our space but he still wants to be friends, and I obviously still want him so will see him as much as possible but I don't want to see him straight after this breakup if he is going to get all he needs (as friends) out of this, while I'm heartbroken. \n The worst part is, that he obviously wasn't even ready to admit what he felt to himself because he is distraught about this. And I pushed him in to it. \n This year a lot of my friends' long term relationships have ended and most have got back together. Everyone is saying that we will and I just don't know what to do. I don't want to hang around in case he doesn't ever want anything, but I really love him so I don't want it to end. I'm just stuck in some numb world where I really do not know what to do. \n So do any of you have advice or some helpful anecdotes?"

Allegory of the seed \n As told to me at a young age by my mother, worked on 3 out of 3 girlfriends. \n Breaking up can be hard, and if you are like me you will tell yourself that your ex is \u201cthe one\u201d and you need her back, well this is a very good way of doing just that. \n First you plant the seed: take a small object, be it a friendship ring, or some other trinket that will remind her of you, tell her to keep it, do not tell her why, just be as nice as possible i.e. \u201chere, Id like you to have this, I had an amazing time getting to know you, and I thank you for allowing me that opportunity\u201d and then walk off into the fucking sunset like the lone rider. \n Now you water the seed: Despite what your brain, heart or nuts tell you do not call her, fill your time with; chilling with friends, working out, playing video games whatever you did before having a girlfriend. DO NOT CALL HER. She will call you, whether it be a couple days, weeks, and in some cases months, and when she does, against your current, lonely judgment keep it short, do not say \u201cI miss you\u201d \u201cI love you\u201d \u201cwanna fuck?\u201d\nJust be short, and kind, tell her its good to hear from her, tell her you\u2019ve been doing well, ask her how she\u2019s been doing, then tell her that you are going out, or you would like to talk more but there\u2019s things you need to do, (make sure to smile while talking, they can hear your smile) and then tell them good bye. With this they will start thinking that you are over her, that you are doing better off than her, and most of all it doesn\u2019t make you look easy, and instead of having you wrapped around her finger and thinking you are easy to get, it will make you look like a challenge. She will DWELL on that shit, her gears will be turning, and you will start to seem desirable. If this doesn't maker her ask for you back then lets move to the next step. \n The sprouting of the seed: After some time, whether short term or long term, whether she\u2019s been single or in a relationship or two (don\u2019t be a jealous prick about her dating, she\u2019s only human) she will look at the trinket you gave her and think to herself \u201cAfter all this time, after all my boyfriends, this guy (meaning you of course), treated me well\u201d that trinket will be imbued with nothing but kindness and warmth, she will constantly think of you and in the end, she will call you and ask for you back. \n The blooming of the flower: Now the plant is fully grown, and you are probably thinking this part means that she ran back into your arms and you are together again, honestly, its what ever you want it to be. In my case, all the ex\u2019s did ask for me back, within a short time, some still ask for me back after 7 YEARS, and once the method worked, once they finally gave in and asked for me back, instead of taking them back immediately like I thought I would, instead I was filled with an ocean full of confidence I never knew I had, it was strange, I turned them down nicely, and continued on with my life, happy and confident and made many friends, each relationship made me stronger. So either the full grown plant is your girlfriend back in your arms with confidence, or you are happily independent and single and full of confidence. You will see what works best for you.

"So this is my first time doing anything like this .. Posting on a forum like this. I don't really know what to do to be honest, because I've really been an emotional reckage the last few weeks, and it kills me. \n So i went to elementary school with this girl ... Back then I was Craaazy in love with her, and she told me later that she had the same feelings for me. But back then it was more teen flirts than anything. \nMoving on, here i am, about to turn eighteen and one night i write her on facebook because ... well, it's been a long time .. \nWe quickly start to talk about litterally anything, and that's when i find out that she ""hasn't been going to school, because she is ATM on a hospital.""

At this time we're approximately together 3-4 times a week. \n I feel this is getting long, so i will skip to the important part. \n Lately, she has started writing less and less to me, and we're only being together one day of the week, which is (in my opinion) waaaay too less, as i basically want to spend all my time with her, i don't care if it's physical or just writing, I just think about her all the time. \nI confronted her with it, and she keeps telling me that she can't control her mood and that ""i can take a break or even call it off anytime i want"" .. \n But I don't want this. I want her really bad, I really do. I just don't know how to handle only seeing her 1 time a week, when we are ""supposed"" to be in a relationship. \n Is it because i don't understand the disease? Or is there more to it? I'm in a really bad spot right here, i understand nothing ... Breaking up is not an option, because if i ever loved someone, it has to be her .. I just don't know what to do. \n Sorry for all my punctation and Grammar mistakes, English is not really my native language, and i think i just wanted to rush to the important part. But here it is."

"So here we go, I've never actually told anyone about this in full, I've been keeping it down, and I'm sort of coming to terms with it now. And now that that's happening, I need some help. So lets start off with my precious high school relationship. We're gonna breeze through it because it's not THAT important. Basically jumped into a relationship, had a bad time, 2.5 years later have a crazy ex that was a super clingy girlfriend. So now that I'm single again, I've been stuffing my nose in my work, and completely disregarding any sort of relationship. Now that's slowly changing. Soon after I cut it with my ex, I met a girl. We'll call her Girl. Now, Girl and I have become very fast friends, we share a lot of the same friends, and we spend loads of time together.

Now cut to this year, we talk on facebook constantly, (we've racked up over 100,000 messages back and forth) and when we're together we're pretty close physically. We dance and cuddle while we watch movies and eat dinner. This year for comic con, we did a Flynn Rider and Rapunzel cosplay together. It was fantastic. We have such a great energy with each other. We share basically all the same views on love and marriage, and we both seem to be looking for a person that just like the other. \n Now here's the problem that requires help. She's not looking for any kind of a relationship ever, she has the thought that ""if it's supposed to happen, it'll happen"". We joke that even if her dream guy fell into her arms, she would turn him down. We've been really really good friends for such a long time, and we've talked about why we would make kind of a crappy couple, and its starting to weigh down on me (hence this post). It's not even that I want anything romantic with her, I just can't see myself spending the rest of my life with anyone else. Like other women, I can see having sex with and kissing and all that stuff, but when I look at her, I see the long run. I see growing old together and raising a family. I want to tell her this, but I have no idea what's going to happen, and THE LAST thing that I want is to ruin the friendship that we have because I cherish that more than anything else in the world.

For a few months now I've been getting turned on by the idea of my gf having sex with another guy either in a threesome or where i watch her have sex with him. I haven't talked to my gf however for a couple reasons. One is that i don't know how she'd take the news of me telling her about i think about her having sex with another guy. I don't want her to see me different if i told her. I also know she sees things like swinging in a more negative view. Another reason for me is that although i like fantasizing about it, the idea of it and the physical act of doing it are big. I tend to be somewhat jealous when she talks to other guys, but not overly jealous or anything like not allowing her to hang out with guy friends or anything like that. So I think about how there's a chance i could regret it afterwards or while she's in the act of having sex with another guy. \n Lately we've also started watching porn while we have foreplay and also during sex. We go through the categories and say which ones we'd be fine watching. She's said yes to ones like threesome and groupsex but no so double penetration and cuckold (she didnt know what cuckold was so i just told her it was when a guy lets his wife/gf have sex with another guy). I've started asking her things like what she likes about the videos (she says things like she likes how the girl is being fucked) and if she wished she was taking part (this only happened in one video with a lesbian threesome). In the times i've done that she seemed into it, especially the threesome one. I haven't asked her though if she'd like being the girl in the video having sex with the guy since i'm afraid she'll react negatively about it. \n Basically im not sure how i can bring this up to my gf and have my fantasy done in someway without her seeing me differently for it if she's not into the idea of it.

Hello R_A. My girlfriend (28) and I (29/m) have been dating for almost 2 years now. In June, I bought a house and she moved in with me. The monthly bills (rent, home insurance, power, heat, internet) are about $1500/month. I pay all bills but the heating bill, which is $300/month which she pays. She makes about $35K/yr and I make $70K/yr. Our work schedules are such that I am often home before she gets off work and I usually prepare supper. I feel like we do equal amounts of housework and upkeep on the house, but I can't help but feel that, seeing as how I contribute much more financially ($1200 vs $300/month), took on the risk of buying the house by myself (without any contribution from her)  and often take care of the biggest daily chore - preparing meals - that maybe she should step up and do more housework than me. Am I straight out of the 1950s or what? I just feel that because I put a roof over our heads and I pay most of the bills (I even pay her dental insurance as I have her on my company plan) that maybe I should get a break. I know she can't afford to pay more than she does, and that's fine, but I'm just like, well if you can't pay any more bills maybe you could step up and take on the responsibility of keeping the house clean. Honestly, I'm Archie Bunker here, but I feel that the relationship is unequal, with me contributing much more financially and honestly, probably more in the housework/meals department as well. Because I feel this way, I resent her a little bit and that is not good for the relationship. If I ever mentioned that I think she should do the housework thou, haha, she would flip! I don't know what to do, but I do know the current situation is not sustainable and will lead to bad things if something doesn't change. We love each other very much though. Does anyone out there have any advice, perhaps from living through a similar situation?	I own the house, pay 80% of bills and do 60% of housework.

"Hello,  let me start with a brief background... I'm a 28 y/o lesbian in a relationship for 5 years. My girlfriend and I are both pretty stay at home types,  we go out occasionally and travel when we can. But for the most part have only had a handful of friends in our current city (I'm had just moved from another city when we met). About 2 months ago, we met met two pretty cool girls who were similar in age and also had similar type jobs and worldviews. The two girls weren't together, just friends.  Anyway we have been hanging out with them kind of regularly the last 2 months. Over the weekend I realized I developed a hardcore crush on of our new friends. I haven't really had a ""crush"" per se since I've been with my current girlfriend. I am incredibly attracted to this woman (friend). I'm sure it's novelty. But I feel so unsettled the last few days I've been at home. Mine and SO's sex life has been on and off pretty much the whole time we've been together.   The last 6 months or so I've seriously considered breaking up with her. But we have a history, are generally happy, and we are pretty much made for each other.  I just don't know if I can live the rest of my life being with someone that either I have no desire for or much attraction toward her.  It's the chicken or the egg thing. I don't know what came first, did my unhappiness come from our lack of a sex life, or did our lack of a sex life ultimately cause me be somewhat unhappy in the grand scheme of things? \n Either way, I don't plan to act on this crush or anything. But I can't get her out of my head. I want it to go away.  I also suspect my girlfriend may or may not have a crush on her too, but doubfully anything as strong as what I'm feeling.  I have this ""I wish I had met her x number of years ago"".  I just want to get rid of the unsettling feeling. I'm also annoyed at myself for always wanting us to make new friends/meet new people, and I happen to crush on the second person we meet. \n I would appreciate anyone's advice.... how have you guys dealt with similar situations?"

My (18m) girlfriend (17f) of 1 year has a new job in which she works 50+ hours a week. Before this, we spent a lot of time together, 3-5 times a week (or upwards of 30 hours). We mostly just hung out, not really many hardcore dates. On top of this, she's also re-united with a past friend and started to hang out with him a lot more. She is close to her family, has no father (deceased) and is middle class. She must pay for 3 years of university. So the past 2 months or so we have only been hanging out for a total of about 6 to 9 hours a week. Is it wrong for me to feel neglected? How should I go about tackling this? \nAs a sidenote, I also am a bit jealous of her new friend but am trying to keep this as my problem only, and am overcoming it.	GF works 50+ hours/week, I only get 6-9 hours per week with her. What should I do?	156	17	relationship_advice
I work for one of the larger EMS helicopter providers, so I thought you might appreciate some perspective from someone in that field. First things first, the FAA study is legit and flight based ems is a potentially dangerous profession. However, there is a huge movement within the industry to improve and most companies are working very hard to make this job as safe as possible and are in fact lobbying the FAA to make the standards much higher than they are currently. \n The biggest thing to consider is the company he would be working for. I hate to say it, but some companies take safety much more seriously than others. Does the company just meet FAA standards (not so good) or does the company take it much farther and hold much stricter standards than the FAA (good). The main things to look for are, pilot training above what the FAA requires, a maintenance program that goes beyond FAA, and a solid safety culture that allows crews to turn down flights and does not pressure them to accept a flight they don't feel good about.  CAMTS  accredidation is usually a pretty good indicator that a company does those things. \n I guarantee even with a not so great company, no one has a 98% chance of dying over 20 years. No one would be willing sign up for a job that meant they wouldn't survive to retirement. \n As far as your other questions go, you may want to check out a book,  The Fireman's Wife  by Susan Farren. The book focuses on how the author dealt with her worry and anxiety, before and after her husband was nearly killed in an accident. I highly recommend it.

"Hi RA. Throwaway here, but I'm an active redditor. My roommate (22F) is ""truly, madly, deeply in love"" with her boyfriend (25M). He is a merchant marine (for the uninitiated, a merchant marine spends approx. 3 months at sea, two months on shore in this case) When their relationship first started, he was exchanging sexy emails with a girl he had met in Singapore. One day his retarded ass decided to leave my roommates computer open with his email exchanges on the screen.  This was strike one. Shortly thereafter, he was due to go back on the boat for a few months. They ""made up"", he left, all was ok for about a month. \n She started cheating on him (for real, physical cheating) with her then roommate(I'll call him George), all while continuing her relationship with current bf. Then my roommate started to become suspicious, and since her bf had left his gmail acct details saved in her browser, she did some snooping and found out that her lovely bf was carrying on a sexy email relationship with a girl from Vancouver as well. After this, she broke up with him, continued sleeping with the roommate for about 2 weeks, at which point bf weaseled his way back into her life. She stayed faithful up until the day he was supposed to get back from the boat. Then she told him that he would have to find somewhere else to live(he was not on the lease) because she was going to have a relationship with george. \n Bf went into disaster recovery mode, spending approximately 20k on her trying to get her back, including buying her an engagement ring and a promise ring. She relented, broke up with george. BF said on multiple occasions that he would seriously maim/kill george if he ever saw him again. Fast forward to now (4 months later) He's on the boat again, my roommate begins to get bored and restless after about three weeks, goes to see george, fucks him, all while keeping up the facade of a good girlfriend. \n Here's where i need your help RA. My roommate asked me the other day if I thought she should come clean to her bf about all of the infidelity (he knows nothing, and would believe anything she says, he's got her on a pedestal) or just forget it all ever happened and continue on with her life and get married to bf etc. What do I say to her? What would you say? Also, has anyone been in a situation like this and actually had it work out?"	roommate asked me if i think she should tell her boyfriend that she cheated on him multiple times over a 6 month period.	433	23	relationship_advice
I've been with my girlfriend for about 2 years now and when we started she had low confidence and self-esteem issues (Stemming from bullying, family issues, bad personal experiences). Over our last couple of years together I have helped boost her self-esteem and confidence  volumes. However, something changed recently. \n She has been putting me down, telling me how I'm 'lucky to be with her' and often criticizes me about my life, career, and other choices. She tries to instruct me on how to do things in my life (and makes sure she points out what I'm doing wrong) and if I tell her that I really just want to handle my own life, she gets upset.  I can't tell if she is doing this because she was often bullied and treated poorly for many years and is now a case of a 'bully victim becoming a bully' This has  been bothering me to no end because I feel like the confidence that I helped instill in her has gone to her head and she is doing the exact opposite to me and is putting me down. I love this girl to no end and we still enjoy good times, but this has become something that is beginning to make me feel like less of a man and it's devastating my pride and confidence. What do you guys think, does she think she's too good for me now? Is this a case of a 'bullying victim becoming a bully'? What are your guys' thoughts?	Built my girlfriend's confidence up from nothing and now she treats me like I'm never good enough for her.	253	19	relationship_advice
I've been in a long term relationship with my girlfriend for 3 years now, and we're both in our final years of university. Naturally, things have gotten very hectic and busy, with both of us working jobs/internships, going to school full time, and making time for friends, homework, free time, and most of all each other. After what seemed to be a minor fight, she decided that we needed to take a break, and we've been on a semi-break for almost two weeks now. The reason I say semi-break is because I've contacted her every 2-3 days to try to make an appeal to her, or come up with a lame excuse to contact her(Clothes left behind, errand needs to be run, etc.) . I know I'm screwing things over for myself by contacting her all the time, but it's hard to stop contacting her, especially when she doesn't seem like she really wants to break up, and just needs some space. When pushed about whether she wants the breakup, she responds that she doesn't know yet, and that I just need to leave her alone for a while. She still wants me to show up to her graduation, and she promised that she'd write to me from her graduation trip with her family. I guess my questions are: How long do I give her, how do I stop myself from hounding her, and is this just a precursor to a real breakup?	Girlfriend wants a break, still wants me to go to her graduation and promises to write to me during graduation trip.	243	21	relationship_advice
Met this girl online, shes definitely the independent type. Went from texting to talking on the phone to both daily. Very good, fun, and flirty. After over a week of this we had a first date that went super well, holding hands in the car, skiing, dinner, movie, lots of laughs and good talking, spent a night together. Couple days later told me it was the best date shes ever had with anyone. Said she had a pretty big crush on me. We continued to talk daily, equally initiating texting/calling, if not more so from her. \n Meanwhile she is extremely busy with work and school, joked about having no business online dating, but we of course kept talking, a week after the first date we had a second where she came to visit. I thought we both had a good time but conversation dropped off immediately and she had said she really needed to tend to her studies because shes been being way too irresponsible, she said she apologizes in advance for being distant for a couple weeks. I told her not to worry and to do her thing, but after sooo much communication, it feels a little odd to not hear from her for a couple days (even though I know that would usually be normal). I like her and almost want to ask but dont want to be pushy, but i feel like i lost my read on the situation.  maybe give it a few days first? I'm also very independent but in a crush id be hard pressed to just turn the desire to talk to someone i like off.	things going really well suddenly drop off, give it a few days? dont worry? shes over it?	273	17	relationship_advice
"Long time lurker here finally posting for some advice because I don't want to share it with people I know. My boyfriend and I have dated for the last two years and although we have had some downs in our relationship there hasn't been anything that we weren't able to get through. We've both been shitty, but for the most part we enjoy one another very much. The other night I was put off by a remark he made about my boobs. I have lost some weight and no longer have the same bulbous boobies as I used to and although I can't remember exactly what he said it was along the lines of not finding them attractive and making fun of them. I'm not typically a sensitive person but it kinda upset me. Then the next night we were having sex and I didn't realize it but I was getting into it and putting too much weight around his neck. He got angry with me which made me uncomfortable and embarrassed and I didn't want to do it anymore but decided I would finish so he wouldn't be mad. Feeling awkward distracted me and made for a terrible time until he asked me what my problem was and got angry. He told me I sucked being on top and that I was an awkward and weird person. I was upset because I've heard nothing but praise in the past so I decided to try and sleep it off. I felt a bit insecure and hurt. He didn't know what he had said to make me upset and then blamed me and it made me cry. So he got angry once more, made some more mean comments, then suddenly tried to apologize. I didn't want to talk to him and just wanted to sleep it off. So he got angry again and called me a cunt. A few minutes pass and he's apologetic and telling me how great I am and shit. Then he continues with telling me how he's envious of my life and how worthless he is and how he should just kill himself. I comforted him and tried to make him feel better cause I don't like hearing someone I love say they should commit suicide. I guess for some more background I'll throw out additional details. I've been told that I'm worthless and destined to turn out like my ""loser mother."" A year into dating and I made out with some dude. I liked a dirty facebook status made by a band and was told that I was a cheating, lying bitch. He said he's slept with 6 people since we've been together once while we were fighting ( fighting like chokehold, being thrown, threatened, barred from leaving) but then the number went to 3 then finally 1. When he said it was only 1 person he was sobbing and said he used a condom. When I asked him about it later on he denied everything and said he was just trying to upset me. I tried breaking up with him once and again barred from leaving and thrown against the wall and then he started sobbing and apologizing. I tried again over the phone but was crushed by how upset he was and agreed to work through it. \n These instances don't happen all the time and in general I'm happy and I love him. \n So, what I would like to know is if this is normal? Overall I'm a very content person, but usually when I'm sad it's because of him. How does one approach this? And what do I do if he responds with self-hating remarks? Do people get passed this and work through it?"	boyfriend made hurtful remarks about me then threatened suicide.	621	9	relationship_advice
I have been seeing this guy about a year and he's my best friend, and I'm in love with him. But I know he's not in love with me. He keeps me around because he's lonely, needs company and I do everything for him. There's no point in going into specifics as to why I believe this because it involves a very long and complicated story. \n But if it were just in my head, he could've proved me wrong by now. But he hasn't. It has gotten to the point where we are very codependent on each other. I am at a crossroads in life and figured the situation would work itself out, that I would need to move somewhere and we would break up and it would be okay. \n But the situation is causing me to be extremely depressed and have very low self worth. That pretty much destroys my capability to do what it takes to find a job and make the move somewhere. \n An obvious answer would be 'just leave him'. but it's not that simple to leave someone you love, who claims they love you back, and who hasn't done anything so inherently wrong that it warrants breaking up with. i'm so dependent on him and love everything about him, except for the fact my feelings will never be able to be quite reciprocated. \n oh, i should also mention i am in a remote area, recent graduate living with my parents, and he is really the only chance at a social life i have right now too. i feel very stuck and i feel like this relationship is part of what makes me so stuck. i feel helpless, and i wish there was a way to be rescued from my situation. i know this was a bit vague but any help would be appreciative	too depressed and dependent on relationship for short-term happiness to end it even though i know it is causing me long-term unhappiness	308	22	relationship_advice
We've been together roughly 5 months, it's all moved very fast and we've been seeing each other regularly (at least 4 times/week) since early on. She's my first real relationship, and first real sexual partner - and I do love her. \n In short, I'm an introvert and a bit of a loner - I like time to myself. Due to inexperience and spinelessness I haven't asserted this time for myself enough since the start. The few times I do broach the topic are often emotional as she'll start worrying that I don't love her any more - on occasions she's been using emotional blackmail (which I have called her out on). \n She's pretty depressed with her current life situation, she's only 19 and can be selfish and childish at times. Her insecurity can make her pretty hostile to any other females I socialize with and she jokingly-not-jokingly will inquire into my text and facebook habits. She relies on me heavily for support with pretty much everything and has no real friends of her own. \n Having said all of this she does truly care about me, and does her best to do right by me after I've expressed my problems.	I guess what I'm asking is what to do? It seems the more I have to consistently ask for time alone every week the more she worries I don't love her - so the more she'll find excuses to be with me. How else can I approach this?	199	48	relationship_advice
"I had dated this guy for about 5 months about a year ago. It was my first major relationship outside of high school. We fell for each other incredibly quickly besides the fact that he and I are/were very level headed. We ended up breaking up dude to some struggles with maintaining a long distance because I had to move away early on in the relationship. I was attending a university 3 hours away from my hometown and where he lives, and neither of us wanted to cancel our school/life plans quite yet for that new of a relationship even though we loved each other. We decided to stay friends and have done so moderately successfully. The only problem was that he would frequently talk to me like i was his girlfriend after we had stopped dating. He would say things as innocent as ""I miss you"" or ""I want to cuddle"" to as blunt as ""I miss you naked,"" ""I miss seeing your sexy bum"" and ""we never spent enough time together naked."" this created tension between us because I still have very strong feelings for him and it would hurt me when he said those things, when I tried to explain that to him, its as if we were speaking entirely different languages. He could not even begin to understand why I could feel anything rather than flattered when he would say those things. Finally we began to talk less and less because of this. We both fought frequently because we wanted so badly to be together but did not have the communication/relationship skills to make us work. We both acknowledged this many times. Until one day, he asks to meet up for coffee and to talk to tell me he was moving across the country for an internship and then abroad to build a life for himself. We left on good fair wells and haven't been consistently in communication since.  Once I heard that I began myself to consider dating someone new for the first time in the entire year we had been broken up. About a month ago I agreed to exclusively see someone I met months after the break up  I was hesitant to tell my ex in fear of hurting him. I recently opened up communication again in an entirely friendly manner (not at all flirtatious) to see how his move went. Today we talked via Facebook (which is only the second time we've communicated at all since I've dated someone new) we've started talking again and he quickly jumped to tell me he was sad. When I asked him why he said that he wanted ""everything with [me]"" and asked if would could elope. I just said no, that wasn't a good idea, and changed the subject. He insisted in on it to more times until I told him that he could not say things like that to me anymore, because I was in a new relationship. he quickly ended the conversation. I apologized for the abrupt news, and he told me that he had to interest in talking at all anymore. He then blocked me on every social network I we have and will not pick up his phone. \n On one hand I'm upset at his reaction to just throw away our relationship like that, on another I am scared that he will do something reckless, and I feel horrible for hurting him like this. I honestly just need to know what my next move is. What should I do?

If you truly love her, do not give up yet. First of all, marriage will sometimes require compromise and learning to meet each other's needs, even when it is difficult. It seems to me that many commenters have this idea that if a partner is not perfectly compatible with you in every way, or if you become bored with them, you should drop them. If you are truly miserable, this would be wise; however you say you love her deeply and are otherwise happy with her. And secondly, perhaps her disinterest in sex is only temporary and will not actually be a problem once you are married, as she implies. You mentioned that she was raised in a super religious household, maybe this causes her to feel dirty or guilty when having premarital sex and the sanction of marriage will relieve her of those feelings and allow her to enjoy conscious-free wild, fun, and frequent sex. In addition, her sex drive should steadily increase over the next couple years anyway if she is in her mid twenties. You are the only one here who really knows what is best for you and your SO; my suggestion is to continue talking to her and try to find the root of the problem (her lack of sex drive could be due to insecurities or guilt, both which can be overcome, or due to anti-depressants which she likely won't be on forever.) You could even try seeing a marriage counselor together.	DON'T GIVE UP! keep communicating with her	248	7	relationship_advice
"Basically what the title says.  Here's the backstory: \n My girlfriend was diagnosed with GERD 6 months ago.  She was getting nauseous in bed and spent more than a few nights in the bathroom freaking out (she has emetephobia, fear of vomiting).  They suggested she get a wedge or a slanted pillow to sleep on.  She opted to sleep on the couch because she can't roll off of it and the lights keep me awake.  That was the start of our drifting. \n After a few months of this it began to get better, but she still has bad nights.  It's under control if she keeps to her diet.  However, the rift is still there.  She has gotten accustomed to sleeping on the couch and has no desire to find a bedroom solution.  The couch is an easier, effortless solution. \n During all this, her sex drive plummeted to 0.  She wants it almost none of the time.  And now she's having issues with her body.  She has lost a lot of weight from choosing to not eat (because of the GERD).  She skips meals if she has nothing readily available that won't make her sick, yet puts herself in that position often.  Also she eats less when she does eat so that she doesn't get sick from being too full.  Because she's lost all this weight, she has lost her boobs (they're probably down to A-cups now) and her butt has shrunk (it used to be very large, and now it isn't, at least not to her). \n In addition to all that, she has developed awful back acne and chest acne.  I suspect it's from sleeping on the couch (microfiber) without a bedsheet, making her sweat quite a bit in the night. \n Because of the acne and the loss of her ""sexy"" features, she feels very unattractive and very unsexy.  Her sex drive has hit rock bottom. \n She seems to have no interest in fixing any of her issues, and by extension, fixing the problems we have in the bedroom. \n I'm basically at a loss.

Seeing a great girl from okcupid, we've had 3 dates now.  I kissed her at the end of the second date.  At the third date (last night), we had dinner and walked around, and after getting to talking about how things were going she mentioned she likes to really get to know a guy and take things slow.  I said of course, I didn't want to pressure her to do anything, I'm fine with that.  But then while walking I tried to hold her hand and she stopped me and said that it was too much.  It kind of threw me off.  Is holding hands this big of a deal by the 3rd date?  I asked about it because it surprised me, and she just said it was moving too fast, so I capitulated.  Finally at the end of the date, we hug, I ask if a goodnight kiss is also moving too fast and she says yes.  She apologized and said the kiss at the end of our 2nd date caught her by surprise (she didn't raise any complaints then!). \n Anyway, I think she does like me, and I like her well enough that I'm going to give her a shot for a while, but I'm not sure how long I can wait without progressing things.  It's uncharted territory for me, with the last girl I was with we were making out by the 3rd date.  It's not all about physical stuff of course, but that's still important to me in a relationship.  Anyone have any advice?  Why might she be like this?  Should I keep trying to initiate more physical contact and wait for her to object, or should I be waiting for her to let me know she's ready?

"Before you read i'll say this is a pretty long post. It's the closest thing i've had to a relationship so it does mean a lot to me. \n So before this girl i've had basically zero to no sexual experience. Pretty pathetic for being 21, but it is what it is. I'm not going to go step by step of how i met this girl and how it's been, but i can tell you 100% she was super interested in me. More than majority of the time she initiated contact (texting, calling, asking to seeing each other etc.). We had great chemistry and when i saw her we always had a good time. But a red flag i caught from the start was that she said she didn't want to be in a relationship, because she just got out a 6 year one. But i was cool with that, because i figured she just wanted to be friends with benefits and i'd see where it would go from there. \n So after a week and a half I finally kissed her and things started progressing. She opened up to me and slowly i started learning all about her life and vice verca. Everything seemed so great. Then one night when we were making out (and really getting into it) and but she suddenly stopped. She asked ""Is there anything i don't know about you that you want to tell me?"" and i said there was one thing. One thing she might not expect and kind of stuttered. Then she said ""You're a virgin aren't you?"", and boy was i embarrassed. She said she could tell by how awkward i was and how seemed extremely inexperienced. She said she was cool with it though, and we sat and had a deep conversation about our lives until 2 in the morning, touching and cuddling and whatever then kissed her goodbye. \n Afterwards, she still initiated contact. Send me funny pictures, but i noticed we wouldn't talk as much or with the same intensity. After a couple of days i asked her to come over to watch a movie friday and she happily agreed. Around 8 that night she sends me a text giving a bullshit reason to flake and says we should move it to tomorrow. Where i went wrong was that i did kind of call her out, but not too aggressively.  She apologized over and over and said we'll hang out tomorrow. So we did, and it was alright. But we barely did anything sexual (i basically just massaged her back, kissing her neck, etc and we sat and talked) just kissed her when she left. \n After that she didn't initiate contact the next day. So i waited till the next day to contact her and gave her a friendly invitation to come work out with me this week (we always work out together). She said she's busy till Wednesday, and said will definitely let me know after that. \n But, she never sends me the good morning texts anymore, or ask about my day. And over the past 2 weeks i can just feel in my gut that she's losing interest. And it's seriously killing me inside. I can't stop thinking about her, and it's seriously fucking with my head. I've definitely developed feelings for her."	So the question is, next time i see her should i confront her about how i feel and possibly bite the bullet of losing her for emotional closure? Or should i just keep backing off and see how it plays out? Thank you for taking the time to read.	554	49	relationship_advice
"Hey everyone. I am going to try to explain this as best I can. I have been dating this girl for 8 months now. At 4 months I knew that I wanted to tell her I love her. I spent the next month kinda asking questions and getting a feeling every now and then if she felt the same way. Every single sign said she did, so at 5 months I finally told her. I did not get it back. I am completely fine with this because I know people move at different rates, so I just let it be for a while. \n After another couple weeks, I said it again cause I figured maybe she had to process it and stuff. Still no return. She tends to move slower with stuff so I was still completely okay. I waited for another few weeks when one day we were talking and she ended up saying ""King_Calverino, I lo-...like you so much, you have nothing to worry about"". I noticed that she intentionally refrained from saying she loved me, and that's when I kinda got a bit concerned. \n I didn't say anything about it though, because I thought maybe she does love me but for some reason she doesn't want to say anything yet. So I let it go for a while until one day we were talking about sex and I made it very clear that I believe to take it to that level both people need to love eachother. She said she agrees, then a few weeks later she said she wants to take it to that level, as did I (we have moved very slowly). So I figured, if she knows how I feel about that, this is a sign that she does love me. \n As you can guess I was pretty confused because I wasn't clear on how she felt. So I just asked her one day if she minds or feels pressured when I tell her ""I love you"" and she said not at all, she loves it. I was hoping she would elaborate a bit more, but she didn't. She also doesn't even send hearts in texts or anything like that. So since she said that she doesn't mind, I have been saying it more when the moment is right and meaningful. A few times I have said it when the moment was realllly right (like she was about to leave for a 3 week trip and was emotional about having to leave), and she has never said it. \n Is it normal for me to be wondering why she hasn't said it? I am not stressing out over it or anything, I am just confused. At first I understood that people move at different rates, but it has been quite a while now and it is obvious that she is avoiding saying it, however all the signs say she feels that way. I don't want to ask her because that's just a straight up horrible thing to do. The only reason this is starting to bother me now is things are reaching a point where we are very serious and I want to make sure I know what this is so I don't get hurt. \n Any advice at all is appreciated. Being 19 with no experience in this, I just want some way of looking at this since I am basically lost. Thank you in advanced."	Girlfriend hasn't said I love you even though all the signs say she does. I have provided many opportunities and it seems she is intentionally avoiding saying it.	571	28	relationship_advice
"I met a guy earlier this year at a mutual friend's wedding. We hit it off, drunkenly made out, and have been texting pretty much daily ever since. After a couple of months, he asked if he could come and visit. (We're across the country from each other.) I said sure- so we made plans for last weekend. We kept texting in the mean time- not all day, every day, or anything, but generally didn't go more than 24 hours without contact. \n The weekend was great- I loved showing him around my town, the conversation never stopped, the sex was pretty stellar, especially considering it was only the second time we met in person. We spend 48 hours straight together, and it all felt so easy- I never felt nervous or uncomfortable, and I don't think he did either. We have so much in common, and we spend most of our time laughing, talking about our lives, really getting to know eachother. At the end of the weekend, he said we should figure out how to be in the same place again, and I agreed. The weekend was so good that I was seriously thinking about asking if he'd be interested in giving long distance an actual shot. \n After that- he's now taken 24+ hours to respond to texts and hasnt mentioned our weekend together. It's not like I really did, either, except for thanking him for a great weekend in part of one. He texted me a couple of days ago, I responded, and... Nothing. \n So, its pretty clear that he's not into me- or not enough that he wants to do an actual long distance thing. My friends very sweetly are trying to tell me that he's just ""processing"" or that he likes me so much he's freaking out and doesn't know what to do. Even if that is the truth, doing long distance with someone who can't or won't communicate about things like that seems like a terrible idea. \n I do really like him as a person though- we have fun together, and I know he's still friends with ex's. So, I guess my questions are as follows: Do I take his silence as a sign that he wants me to just fade away quietly, or is there a chance he still wants to be friends, and just doesn't want me building too much on our weekend? is it appropriate to send a follow-up text making sure he's OK/that theres not actually something external going on? Do I let him know that this radio silence is really not cool? Normally, I'd just let him face and bitch a little to my friends about him being an ass, but mutual friends means we'll probably run into each other again. And like i said, he's a ton of fun, and I'd like to actually be friends with him after I get over the ego bruising of him not wanting to date."	Spent the weekend with a guy, he's probably pulling away, is there a way to make it clear I'd be fine just being friends/friendly but that what he's doing isn't cool, without sounding like a crazy person/bitch?	492	37	relationship_advice
We met over thanksgiving break, spent that whole weekend in bed together. We both then went away to different colleges for about two weeks and texted almost constantly that entire time. Once we got home, we met up a lot over break. I think the longest we went without seeing each other was 3 or 4 days. However, the constant texting stopped and now that we're both back at school it's hard because I miss talking to him. During the time where we were constantly texting, he expressed interest in possibly wanting something more in the future. \n It seemed like things were moving pretty fast I guess, but it seemed right at the time. Now that we're not texting as much anymore (and I see him being active on other social media so I know he's not just not texting me because he's too busy), it's kind of making me think that he's lost the feelings from the beginning while I'm still left here with them. \n I planned on asking him how he felt about us or just telling him how I felt before we both went back to school but I pussied out. This past week, he didn't text me once until I texted him, and he told me he missed me and had a lot of fun over break with me, and asked me when my next break was so he could see me again. We texted for a little while and then he stopped answering me. \n I guess I'm just really confused on where to go from here. I want to say something but I don't want to scare him away. We haven't really gone on a proper date at all even though we talked about it in that initial period, every time I tried to bring it up over break he never got back to me. Him and his ex broke up in August so I'm thinking there could still be potential for us to have a relationship, but it just being too soon right now. Or if I should just move on and let it go. Any advice would be great! \n And if I do say something now while we're both at school how should I go about doing it and saying it? We've never really talked on the phone or anything like that	Want to tell my FWB how I feel but not sure if it will scare him away. I'm willing to wait to say anything if there's would be better potential for a relationship as a result.	389	36	relationship_advice
There have been serious problems in our family (mother, father, my brother and I) for a while (basically my father doesn't always respect us and I don't always respect him) but lately things have gotten worse. \n It all started two months ago when we had an incident were I told him he was crazy. Since that day he was not spoken to me (not that we spoke much apart from him telling me off before that). In fact he has stopped talking at all, and has put himself in this sort of bubble where he goes to work at 7:30 and comes back at 8! We all think he is a workaholic but don't know how/can't help him. He eats really fast with us and then leaves. This whole thing has made my mother extremely sad, she says we will end up like those sons and fathers who never talk to each other and never see each other. \n It is impossible to communicate with my father, he doesn't listen (I can't emphasize this enough). \n My parents 25th anniversary is comming up, my mother REALLY wanted to go on a trip, but we all know it's not gonna happen. The reason my parents don't divorce is because my mother is a very forgiving person, still loves my father (he doesn't love her back), and fears it would affect my 15 yo brother's relationship with our father. I don't know what to do, I know things won't get better, and I just want my mom to be happy (and my dad too, but that's even harder).

"28M, 27F (open relationship, fwb, 9 months, not official gf/bf) \n I think she does it unintentionally, but she's very manipulative in making me feel bad when I happen to be busy and working on class (grad school) or staying extra late at work to finish up projects or if I decide to do something with family or friends. She finds a way to always sneak in ""damn, i was going to ask you to do -FILL IN THE BLANK- but you're busy"". To me, it feels like she waits until the very moment that I decide to make different plans instead of waiting around for her availability, to make me feel bad about choosing not to hang out with her. If I decide to meet up with some old high school buddies, even if it's only for an hour or two, she'll say things along the lines of ""hey, i was waiting and going to ask to see if you wanted to go see -FILL IN THE BLANK-, but now you're meeting up with friends so we cant."" \n She knows I'd rather spend time with her whenever I can, but I like to make sure I still see friends and spend time with family as well. And school and work is important and she has no idea how many times I've neglected BOTH to spend so much time with her and it's hurt both my grades and work performance. But this isn't something I'll tell her, because then I'll be a hypocrite in the whole annoying ""guilt tripping"" behavior. \n Another example... if I have to drive home after visiting her area on the weekend (which happens to be where my parents are as well), as I live 65 miles away, as I'm driving away and already on route back home really late on a Sunday night, she says things along the lines of ""damn, if you weren't already headed home i was about to get ready to ask you to sleepover and commute in the morning."" \n Final example... if it's late on a work-night evening, and I decide I feel like playing some video games to unwind for a little bit, she'll get passive-aggressive and say things like ""i was going to ask if you wanted to video chat, skype, etc but since you're too occupied with video games i'll just talk to you tomorrow, goodnight."" \n Things like this really irritate me and I've called her out on it a couple of times and she'd get defensive or deny she meant to make me feel bad or guilt trip me. \n Lately, I just don't even initiate conversation when I'm busy because I can anticipate some sort of guilt trip.

Here we go, first post on Reddit. Not sure if this is the best place for this but here goes: \n So I've known this girl who is 2 years younger than me since I was a kid, always thought she was really cute but in recent years it's like shes taken on this whole other level of beautiful. I'm insanely attracted to her and though I don't really see her all that often, whenever I do I inevitably end up talking to her the entire time I'm with her, even though I try to make a conscience effort not to. \n While I wouldn't say she's ever been the focus of my life, lately I've thought about her more than I want to because of how attracted I am to her, even though I really never saw a chance of us getting together. I should also mention that besides the fact that she's insanely gorgeous, she also has similar interests and sense of humor as me. I think because of all that, I've kind of grown to idealize her in my head as this perfect girl. This is all the more crazy when I realize now that I really do not know her all that well. \n Anyways, we were both recently at a party that I knew she was going to be at, and despite my best efforts not to spend the whole night talking to her, I'm told that is exactly what I did (I was very, very drunk). By the end of the night, by some miracle, I found myself making out with her. Making out quickly escalated and within moments I had her basically completely naked. At this point she was ready to have sex which, honestly, completely threw me off. I remember just being shocked and not doing anything because I realized that in my head, the idealized version of her I made was this innocent girl who was inexperienced and hadn't been with many, if any, guys. Now, I realize this is a totally dumb line of thinking. I can't rationalize it, but it's what was going on in my head, and is part of what is making me feel awful. \n So there we were, she was naked, ready for sex, and I went as limp as silly putty. She made some remark about it that I can't actually remember but was pretty offended by, and after a few more minutes of making out we stopped and passed out. Except I never fell asleep and just felt shitty ever since. Its been almost a week and I still feel awful and am thinking about her more than ever. Instead of feeling happy that I had actually done something with this girl, all I can think about was... how easy it was and how quickly she advanced from making out to being ready to bang. I guess I just thought if she was like this with me, she's probably like this with lots of guys. Now I'm here because I'm not really sure why this bothers me so much, and what I can do to stop thinking about her. I basically all at once feel stupid, embarrassed, and hugely disappointed, yet still find myself interested in this girl, and it's taking up my daily life.

"Hey, all!\nI feel like a 12-year-old asking such a question, but any insight could, at the very least, ease my overactive mind. \n First things first.  A few months ago, I got out of a 5+ year relationship.  I focused on myself and things are all good.  A few weeks ago, after I knew with certainty that I was ready to get back out there, a classmate (professional school) caught my eye.  Due to various obligations, we have almost no time to talk, but we did catch each other staring way too often for grown adults lol.  We ended up having lunch together amongst friends, and we seemed to click.  I added her on facebook and liked one of her photos.  A few days later, I posted a status and she reciprocated the like.  Normally I'd think nothing of it, but she is extremely inactive on facebook, very seldom ""liking"" things.  I posted on her wall about a week later, basically complimenting her on killing it during class and jokingly asking for help with the class subject.  She immediately responded by complimenting my abilities in another class and agreeing to help me if I helped her, even including a smiley face, which is even rarer from her.  Cool.  Then a classmate made a comment about how happy she was to see our interaction.  That received a like from the woman I'm interested in.  All signs look good. \n Then, a few days ago, after having been unsuccessful in talking to her at school (I have obligations prior to class; she after), I sent her a facebook message asking if she wanted to begin studying for upcoming finals.  I included my phone number for ease of contact.  She viewed it shortly afterward, but never responded in any way.  Now, for the past few days at school she hasn't so much as said a word to me (though, in fairness, due to feeling rejected for one of the first times in my life, I have not so much as looked at her more than one or two times).  Nothing happened from the time she showed interest to the present. \n And here I am today:  a grown man in a professional school worrying like a lovestruck teenager.  Sigh.  Is this all in my head, or am I right to assume she has cooled significantly?  Is there anything I can do to figure this out?  I'd like to just talk to her, but if she feels uncomfortable around me right now, the last thing I want to do is intrude on her personal space."	connection made, nothing changed, things seem to have cooled off now.  What gives?	429	13	relationship_advice
"I will set it up as to try to be fair to the situation. I have been with my current gf, around 7-8 months. It's been rough at times but generally happy with her, but from the start we've had certain problems in the bedroom. Though I've never had the problem before, I've seem to have it a lot with her when I finish more quickly than I would want to. She was nice and understanding at first, but quickly got frustrated which I can understand. I have made myself go a second time, which sometimes is difficult or can hurt from being sensitive to make sure she is pleased, in fact I can barely remember a time where I didn't try to again. I would prefer to do other things to get her there, but those options aren't really open. She's ruled out fingering, and doesn't ""like oral, just wants sex."" So I've been doing what I can to try to get her there. \n Well we hadn't had sex in about a week, when we finally did last night. I didn't exactly finish early, it was about 12-15 minutes, which isn't long but usually more than enough for her to finish. Well she didn't this time, and when I did she became very angry. She said things like ""I knew I should of never had sex with you"" which of course upset me I said then she doesn't have to, she said then why are you even here, or why are we together, I had planned on going again to try to help her, but I didn't want to even think about it after that. Which only made her more angry, that ""I just got what I wanted, I got to"" I tried explaining I can't really control it, I've tried to and I've tried doing what I can to make sure she gets to finish every time. To which she starts to laugh and go on about how she has to position me and ""concentrate really hard to even cum with you"" I asked what she meant by that, and she responded that I ""never turn her on, I just try to kiss her and hold her and touch her, that me alone isn't doing it."" I was pretty hurt by all this, asked if she's even attracted to me then if I don't turn her on and she never answered, and still haven't said if she is even attracted to me when I directly asked. \n I tried to put pride aside and talk to her, she says I can do other things than just have sex to please her. I said I would like to, I've asked what she would like me to do and she doesn't specifically tell me. she doesn't want oral, she doesn't want fingering, she's consistently complained when I've ""done to much foreplay, she wants sex and should just get to it."" So I asked her what she would like me to do, to which she said ""What, you've never had good sex? Cause there's plenty of things you should be able to do even within that and I shouldn't have to tell you."" \n Overall I felt pretty insulted and down about myself. I left her place which I usually stay on Sundays, told her I was upset about how she said things and the way she brought things up, that I felt she was being mean and a little unfair but she's still refusing to apologize because ""she's not ok with what happened either."" I just have rarely ever felt this put down by someone i've been with, and have a huge problem with this, I don't know exactly what to do."

"I've been dating my girlfriend for four months now. To be honest, I've been considering breaking up with her the entire time. However I can't justify breaking things off without trying to improve it first. I would love to have a relationship we are are both comfortable, can indulge each other, and create memories together (who wouldn't, right)? However there are a few things that I believe are preventing that. \n I should state that we are both a bit introverted. Despite being together for a few months, our conversations do NOT flow. I almost hate calling her at night because I know the conversation will die within 5 minutes. I try to listen, really listen, to what she says to create conversation topics, but those too die off. I almost feel like I'm talking to a wall. It's hard enough not being a great conversationalist, but this just doubles the problem. \n Aside from that, she hardly shows any emotion towards me. No touching, no initiating, no emotion, no nothing despite me being affectionate often. \n I've mentioned all of this to her but she replied saying that's just the way she is and ""it is what it is.""

So here's the full story. I met this girl, a fellow Redditor actually. [Thus the throwaway] She lives in my city, near by, and we've been talking non-stop for the last week. We have tons in common, more than I'd like to say that I really thought possible. We like the same foods, places, movies, tv, shows, have similar careers, stand points on political and social aspects of the world etc. She's funny, intelligent, artistic, all so far everything is looking great. \n Now the dilemma. I've been out of the dating scene for FAAAAR too long, I'm not really use to hitting it off so great with someone like this so effortlessly. Which has my over-thinking self, doing what it does best. She wants to come over and watch movies and hang out one day? Simple date. But, I don't know what to do. Do I make it romantic? Do I keep it light and friendly until I'm sure she likes me? Do I ask if she likes me? How do I sit? Do I sit like close to her like in a romantic way? Do I sit a bit away like we're buds hanging? I don't want to give her the wrong impression that I don't like her as much as I do. \n I also don't wanna make it seem like I'm in love with her and crazy 0-100 kinda person, but she's really awesome and I am generally very happy to talk to her and be around her. Conversation with her flows easily, so that's not an issue, and I'm not really socially awkward so that's not my problem. I'm just an over-thinker, I look to far into things and I don't want that aside of me to really mess up what seemingly could be something really awesome right now. \n As it stands we've only spoke on skype, and text message (almost all day. Luckily she keeps the same late hours as I do. Win!). I want to invite her over for Halloween to hang out and watch scary movies or whateve's. She says she might go to a party at her friends. She brought it up that she was going to go only after I stated I had no plans for the day. Is that her way at hinting that she wants me to go?  She told me there would be video games, and she even went as far to Challenge me to a game of Smash Brothers? Is that an invitation? Do I ask if I could go? Is that inappropriate? What do Reddit.

Now, I'm not the kind of person to just pick up someones phone and go through their personal stuff. Something in my heart told me that something is just not right and curiosity won me over. I picked up his phone and found text messages he exchanged with another girl. My first reaction was ""No big deal, just texting a friend maybe"" until I read a few parts. \n He was telling her that he would be so happy to see her again and they cant wait to meet up sometime."" and the sort. But the text that blew my mind was when the girl asked him ""Don't you have a girlfriend?"" and he replied ""No I'm Single..."" It tore my heart to pieces! I confronted him about it and he immediately began yelling at me saying that I should have never gone through his phone. I admit it, what I did was wrong, but what he did was also wrong. \n I was in tears, and screaming at him about how dare he deny me after all the years we've been together. I cried all night until I worked up the courage to call a cab home at 3am. \n The next day I get a phone call begging for forgiveness and that he truly does love me. He also explained that what he did was wrong and he instantly regret it. Like a fool in love, I came back to him but still feeling angry about the whole situation...

"Throwaway account, as some people involved know my username. \n ""Samantha"" (fake name) and I have known each other for around three years, and up until only recently it hasn't really extended far beyond something platonic. We met through my younger brother, who is fairly close (non-romantically) with the daughter of an old family friend. You could say Samantha is one of this girl's BFFs, and has, along with a couple of other classmates and buddies, tagged along on several outing over the years; this group and our family have been on several camping trips together, along with many small meet-ups every few weeks. \n Everything has been pretty static, up until the last few weeks. The last couple of times we've seen each other, Sam and I (at least, I think) have developed some chemistry together. All the cliched signs - prolonged eye contact, close proximity, she laughs at my jokes, etc. and I started to develop feelings too, regardless of whether my observations were all just made up in my head. \n Unfortunately, this was only during a short visit home, and both of us had to return to school, so we left it at that. I'm a pretty Beta guy, but a couple of weeks ago I finally mustered up some courage and struck up a conversation over Facebook, and it went over well. I hit her up again a couple of days ago and we've been chatting intermittently ever since, and it's all been great so far. Sam's really growing on me, and frankly, she's been taking up more and more of my thoughts - I woke up thinking about her this morning, and I'd really like to take things further. \n But here's my issue. As we have several states between us, I'm not sure how or when to approach the dating question. My ideal situation would be getting together over Thanksgiving break for a date and seeing how things roll, but is securing a date several weeks away - and only a few days into real, continued conversation - a little premature? At the same time, I don't want to lose my chance - I'm afraid that if I wait, over several days' and weeks' worth of conversation I'll eventually be slotted into ""that nice guy friend I talk to online"" in her mind. This is her first semester in college, and she's meeting a lot of guys that are much more present than I am currently, and understandably, she might find herself leaning towards that scene if I don't make a move; her best friend, a member of the previously-mentioned family outing group and attending the same college, is already in a relationship. It doesn't help that my brother (not interested, as far as I know; in fact, had a long-standing crush on the girl just mentioned, poor guy), coincidentally, has been casually chatting her up as well in the last few days, and I don't want to get lumped together with him as ""The [last name] boys and I are just good friends"", as that's what they've been for several years. So I'm feeling the pressure a little bit here, but don't know when exactly to act. What, or when, should be my move here? Have I known her long enough that I bring up the topic now, (hopefully) secure a time and date to meet up, or do I hold off and chat her up a few more days, waiting until a time closer to Thanksgiving?"	Fell for a long-time family friend while away at college, she  may  have similar feelings. Want to ask her out, but too far away to immediately act on it - afraid that if I wait too long, I'll lose my chance or the chemistry will go stale, when relegated to platonic texting.

I have a thing for wanting to feel extremely girly in a relationship. I always go for guys who are much taller than me so I feel especially short, I purposely don't gain muscle so that I can be dainty compared to them, and... ideally, I would have a boyfriend who is at least 5 years older than me. \n However, I met my current boyfriend when I was still quite young and not as mindful about age, since I felt young (and  was  very young!) regardless. Nowadays, however, I feel like my youth is slipping and I feel like dating someone older than me would make me stop feeling so old. I also keep thinking about how often cheating happens, and how if he were to cheat on someone even 2 years younger than me, I'd be devastated with age-jealousy. \n My boyfriend is absolutely wonderful to me and has never once suggested I'm old or anything -- this is all internal. But I'm seriously considering breaking up with him just to be with someone older, just so that I  feel  younger and more content. It's worth nothing that I never really had a childhood because I was so introverted, so maybe that's part of why I'm so desperately trying to cling on to feeling youthful. Is it worth it to explore relationships with older people to get this feeling I desire? Or is it just insane? Help!

Is it worth breaking up with him over? \n Quick edit: reading over my own post, it's kind of scary how little I disregard my own boyfriend's feelings throughout all this. Do I sound horribly narcissistic to anyone else?	237	62	relationship_advice
Hey guys so, I've been dating this girl for about 2 months now, we've been having issues about a few things.  The first one (probably the biggest for me) is condoms: \n I want to use them, she is on the pill, swears there is no need for it.  I know the statistics well, and honestly even with perfect use 1% is still too high for me and I'd feel better using a condom as well.  Shes not down.  For a few reasons: \n 1) I can't finish unless we are going at it for ~20min (possibly my baseline, which is normally like 10-15, or because of fear I'm not sure), this is a problem because she's not use to going that long (past has been max 5min).  She thinks the condom makes this longer, but I don't think it really does, but I haven't timed it.  I think its more a positional thing (I generally need to be on bottom to finish). \n 2) The pregnancy thing is as I said above.  Basically she thinks there is no chance she gets pregnant.  This is complicated by the issue that she really wants me to finish inside her, which is not helping my fears regarding that. \n Thats the main issue I'm not exactly sure how to deal with, I'm in med school currently and she is a pre-med at the same uni, we both have things that we need to do for the next 5-10 years so pregnancy is not what either of us want. \n Besides that she's a little too clingy, and gets insanely jealous about other women (I have a ton of female friends) talking to me.  My issue with ending the relationship is complicated, basically for the next 2 months I'm studying for a board exam that determines my life.  My med school friends are doing the same so we won't be hanging out.  Having someone outside of the studying insanity helps me relieve stress when I'm free, and makes me not feel so lonely for these months.  It's kind of selfish on my end because I know I'm leading her on.	GF doesn't want to use condoms, says pill is fine.  I don't agree.  I don't feel anything deep about her and feel like I'm leading her on/using her.	352	28	relationship_advice
"My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 5 months.  Our relationship is going well overall and we tend to be good about talking about issues to resolve them (thus we have had no major fights, etc.).  However, she is really insecure and it is starting to bother me quite a bit.  I have no problem with saying ""I love you,"" and I do love her, but it feels like I  must  say it.  She says it very often (on average probably at least every ten minutes we are together--no matter what we are doing) and, honestly, this is too often for me.  I feel like the main reason she says it is to hear me say it back, and this is what annoys me the most.  It just feels like no matter how often I say it or what I do to show it, she still needs to hear it more. \n She often complains that I don't ""say it first"" enough.  I feel like I actually do say it first a reasonable amount of the time, though when I say it first it is mostly to appease her.  She also hits me with ""I love you more"" about once a day (I usually respond with ""no you don't"" and ""please stop saying that; it makes me feel bad"" [she doesn't stop]) \n Her bouts of insecurity often hit in the middle of something else like watching a movie or sex and she will suddenly start asking me ""do you think we'll stay together forever"" or talking about things way in the future, or just the things in the above paragraph. \n I really don't know what to do.  ""I love you"" has really turned into something I have to say instead of want to say, and her insecurity has not improved at all in the past 5 months.  It is very taxing to have to settle her down so frequently and I don't know how to (or if it is even reasonable to) approach her about these problems.  While we have been good at discussing problems in the past, this one feels too emotionally charged and there is no good way of telling her ""I don't like that I feel forced to say 'I love you'"""	My girlfriend's insecurity and fishing for me to tell her I love her is bothering me, but I don't know how to approach it	376	24	relationship_advice
So a good friend of mine (I'm a guy) has a boyfriend who has violated her privacy multiple times via looking through her phone texts and facebook messages (ones from me in particular). \n I will admit we had a fling a few  years  back.. she lives in cali now (I'm in Florida) so ya that's it, no more sexual advances since. \n Anyway recently she entrusted him with looking after her phone while she was getting eye tests done (he knows her password). As you can imagine she came back to him having looked through her facebook and text messages. \n She has tried to look at contents on his phone because of this but to no avail. I think that it's pretty messed up that she can't entrust him with something as simple as holding onto her phone for a little bit without having to worry about him going through her private messages. Furthermore he angrily argues with her as if she has done something wrong in talking to me (he has made it clear that he doesn't like the two of us conversing) instead of owning up to the wrong he's done to her in violating her trust.	the title sums this up^^^	198	5	relationship_advice
so this is a throwaway account.\nI've been with my boyfriend for 2.5 years and in a LDR for the past year. Before that we've had sex a couple times but I greatly exaggerated how good it felt during cause I wanted to make him feel good. But I hate sex. I hate everything about it. I just put my feelings aside to please him but after we had sex I was depressed and cried a lot. I never felt so disgusted and humiliated. He doesnt know that. He has been texting me recently that he wants to try anal. This terrifies me and just thinking about replying to him gives me a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. I don't want to make him mad. Should I tell him that sex is just not for me or should I suck it up and just give him what he wants?\nthank you so much	I hate sex so much but I fake it for my bf.

"I have this good friend for about two years. The friendship has always kinda fluctuated due to life and what not. But I feel like we've always been close. We hang out one on one, she shares a lot of life stories with me, and I do her too. When she got locked up last year, she wrote me while she was in jail, and we hung out a lot when she got out. \n I remember not too long ago, when we were hanging out and drinking, she told me that I am one of her best friends and she's glad that I'm apart of her life and that I'm one of the few people that know a lot about her life and her past. \n However, I haven't seen her in over a month, going on 2. I'm worried that she might have lost interest because I never made a move, despite her dropping subtle hints (Ie: One time she came over to my house, and according to my roomates, was all dolled up just to watch  a movie). \n Anyway, late last month I sent her a text, she didn't reply to it. 2 weeks later, I went on a vacation and posted some photos, and she ""Liked"" one of them, so at least a minor interaction was a good sign. A week after I got back, I sent her another text. This was last Tuesday. \n Me: Hey. How's everything been. I hope good :) \n[No response for a day] \nMe: Hey, I hate to be annoying, but is everything cool between us? If I did anything wrong, I'd like to know what. \n Her:  Hey! I'm so sorry. I've been meaning to text you. You didn't do anything wrong. \nMe: Word. I was just curious because it's been a minute. How've you been btw? \n Her:  Good. Just working a lot. I finally got my court case settled. I was going to move out of my mom's house, but now I have  2500 of court fees to pay off. \nMe: That sucks about your fees. That's good you at least got your court case behind you. BTW, do you like comedy shows? [Redacted] and I are going to one on Saturday, and I have a few extra tix. \n Her:  I have to work Saturday unfortunately. What time is the show? \nMe: 730 \n Her:  Yeah, I'm probably not going to be able to go.. \nMe: Okay. Well, we should hang out sometime when you're free. \n[Conversation ended] \n I feel like I could have re-established attraction after she mentioned moving out of her mom's house. I probably should have told her about a goal of mine too, but I didn't. I also feel like maybe I was creepy/selfish by pushing the issue by asking ""are we cool?"" Idk.. \n Anything I can do to salvage everything? This conversation happened 8 days ago btw. I miss her to death.

"Is there ever a time where you decide to hold back? When do you think it's appropriate? \n I (f,24) am currently in a LDR with my boyfriend (23), we've been apart for about 2 months, together about 7. Last night he called me after the bar and was pretty drunk. He told me this funny/ weird story about his roommate and the moral of it was that he thought the guy was a scumbag, basically (they were put together, it wasn't on his choosing). I guess the kid was running around acting like a weirdo a few weekends ago, hitting on a ton of girls and trying to dance with them and stuff while his poor wife is at home waiting for him to get out of training, unaware that he's just a loser (they got married like a month ago too). And in the story the kid did some REALLY weird stuff, to which my SO said ""I would defend guys on most stuff but this is just something else"" blah blah blah. The sentence  won't  get out of my head. I keep going back to it,  What does he mean by that, would he find the rest of that stuff acceptable? And if so, would he accept it from his friends or is this something he finds acceptable for himself to do?  It's just one little thing that he drunkenly said off hand and it's like the only thing I got out of an hour long conversation. \n I love him so much and trust him whole heartedly, he's extremely honest and tells me everything, too much sometimes. He calls me every time he comes home from being out to say goodnight, and I hear from him every single morning without fail. I don't really feel like he'd ever act like this kid, but the way he said it in the context of the story, I dunno I guess it kind of threw me a bit. \n Anywho...I am under an extreme amount of pressure from this relationship anways, particularly from my mom about my deciding to move to be with my SO, and I kind of feel like I may be harping on this to pick a fight, in a way, if that makes sense?  Although, when I write it down it doesn't make any sense at all. I've been thinking about it all day and have no idea if it would be right to bring it up or not. I also feel like I'm projecting a bit, though out the whole story I just felt so bad for this guys wife and kept thinking about how I would feel in her shoes.  I don't feel like he meant anything by it, and if roles were reversed and he brought it up to me afterwards, I'd probably feel like I was being accused of something. But, like I said, I really don't think he'd ever act like this, which is why he was telling me the story anyways. It would just be nice to clarify? \n Could this be one of those times where the distance is making me sensitive and I should use some discretion? Or is the best policy to always be open about what you're thinking, even if the risk is hurting the other persons feelings a bit or maybe even causing a big fight over nothing? I guess it's important to note that he's the greatest guy I've ever dated, but I have a long history with scummy cheating dudes and I am really trying to keep a hold on separating my thoughts between them and him."

She recently broke up with this guy. They've been together for a soild 2-3 years, but she's left him multiple times, and they've been on and off for over 5 years, total. We're not currently dating or anything, but she knows I really like her. I couldn't be happier knowing she's now single, but deep down, I'm concerned I should be cautious. Is it common for people to date on & off, and break up with who they're with to go back to that person? If her and I dated, would it possible I could get left and she go back to him? Or maybe if we date, and I'm better than he was, she'll forget him? I understand if this question is too vague of details to answer. But considering she just went through a rough break up, leaving him, I feel it's very inappropriate right now  to talk to her about her previous boyfriends (or if I ever should). \n If any of you have been in a similar situation as to mine, or been in her or his shoes, I'd love some help!

"So this is a throwaway account, and my gf is a frequent redditor and I would rather her not see this, so I've fibbed in the title a bit.

Ok, where to begin... My husband and I have been together for 5yrs - married for 2. Our married life has been a hellish roller coaster primarily for one reason: his baby momma. Their child is 5yo. And he adores me. At least, he did. His mom is slowly, but steadily turning him against me. She does everything she can to make our lives hell. She calls my husband in the middle of the night to talk about their child (but  somehow  ends up off topic). Whenever their son has a school event or anything, she says I cannot go and says that if I do go, she will force their son to leave the event immediately. She lies to my husband constantly - saying that I'm going with other men cheating while he's at work (never, ever have I cheated), yelled at their child when he was in my care, etc. All lies. She tells their son how much she hates me and actually disciplines him if he speaks about me when he's with her. My husband and I have a child together and his baby momma doesn't allow their son to say he has a sibling or half-sibling. She spreads malicious lies about me, posts awful lies about me on facebook (I've even deleted my account due to the libel, harassment, etc.). Anyway... I've tried everything - honestly everything. This woman is mentally ill and has a serious drug and alcohol problem (my husband has primary custody). My question is... When is enough, enough? My husband actually said to me earlier that, although he loves me and wants to be with me, it's turning his son's life (and our lives) into a living hell just dealing with this woman. He's not happy, I'm not happy. Their son is really suffering when he's with his mom due to things she says and her behavior. We've been to court, had harassment charges filed, had a PFA against her for their son... We went to counseling, she's been to rehab twice, we moved further away from her (still in the same county, but not as close), had her go to court-mandated parenting classes, ignored it entirely... Nothing has worked and nothing changes anything for long. I'm truly torn. I love my husband and he loves me. But we don't love this life together and it's all because of her...

So my girlfriend and I broke up after being in a relationship after a year and a month because we never saw eye-to-eye on anything. It was more one-sided with me breaking up with her because I became increasingly unhappy. \n After a week we got back together but it only lasted for two weeks afterwards because there was no change. But I eventually grew obsessed with trying to get her back because I only broke up with her the second time because she stood me up twice on two dates. \n Flash forward four months later she suddenly wants me back. After sitting down and talking we ended up making out and having sex. She eventually tells me the bad news: \n She has had meaningless sex twice with one of her co-workers. She said it mean't nothing to her but it happened twice. \n I didn't have sex with anyone except her and we lost our virginitys to each other so when she had sex with someone else it came to a massive shock. \n I don't know if I want to take her back, I'm so conflicted because I still love her but knowing that she had sex with someone else twice really makes me rethink what I want. \n I feel as if I have meaningless sex with someone else I might forgive her, but that's just immature to do.

When we're together she's very affectionate; she'll randomly hug and kiss me, kiss my hand when we're holding hands in the car, etc. \n About three weeks ago, or a month after our first date, I asked her if she'd like to make things official (because I've read that typically this happens after 7-9 dates, or a month). Her words were something along the lines of ""Not that I don't want to, but I think we should give it more time."" That was totally fine in my opinion, because we're both recently out of long-term relationships; 3 years for me, 5 years for her. \n Recently, the topic came up again and she mentioned that she still wants to meet new people, and she hasn't excluded the option of dating other people; although she isn't at the moment.

"Hi, I don't post a lot on reddit so forgive me if this comes out wrong. It's kind of a complicated story but I will try to make it brief.\nI met this guy over this summer (2-3 months ago) at an internship we were both at from out of state. We were roommates and got along great right away, super attracted to him, etc. Eventually we ended up sleeping together. \nHe wanted to pursue a relationship right away, but it took me aback a little since I hadn't been in one in so long, and the last one was painful because we took it too fast and it ended in a messy breakup. I didn't want a repeat of that, but I also wanted to take a chance, so we began dating as bf/gf. \n At first it felt amazing, but after a few weeks I found things weren't quite as fun as when we were friends. He was naturally a lot more affectionate than I was and moving a little quicker than I wanted to and soon enough, even though he was amazingly nice, I was not having fun anymore and  was just feeling super pressured all the time. though I think it was more myself putting the pressure on me than him. \nEventually, we broke up. I immediately felt crushed though and saw how sweet he was to me, even in the midst of us breaking up and thought ""why would I leave someone like this?"" \n We kept hanging out though and seeing that side of him be so fun and confident around our friends, it wasn't long until we were back together. We dated until we both left the internship and went back home and kept it up long distance, but the same feelings I was having of 'this doesn't feel right; its not ever as fun as im expecting it be when were not together; etc' kept up and I felt I had to break up with him to avoid us getting more attached and an even more painful breakup. \n Basically the whole time we were together it was just back and forth in my head of 'when hes acting a certain way, this is great' and then 'what am i doing, he's so much more serious than i am, i can't handle this.'  But of course, being without him now, (we broke up only 2 days ago), I find myself missing him all the time. I thought about what went wrong and realized when he was being more fun and casual, all of that melted away and I just wanted to be with him. \n I spoke with my sister about this and she said that maybe he was acting different in a relationship because he felt like he had to try harder or something and I could have brought that up with him to see if he could act more casual and fun the way he does when we're not together, but I worry that's too much like asking someone to change.\nI also have some commitment issues myself I fear could be clouding my judgement on the issue. I'm not doing anything about it right now to try to let my mind get an objective view of the situation, but I'm just looking for outside advice on if it could be worth it to reconcile things.

"Original]( and [Update]( \n Hey guys, so I got a few PMs asking me to update so I thought, hey why not, I owe ya'll for the advice. :) \n So Link and I have been going steady for about 2 weeks now. Everything has been awesome. I've been having some tough school stuff because of finals, and he really couldn't be more supportive. \n An example would be the other day when I was freaking out about an exam. I was at school early and texted him at like 7am to see if he was awake/could come visit me at my study spot (he lives on campus). He showed up 5mins later in his pajamas and a hoody and we just sat there with his arms around me while I teared up on his hoody and he told me I'd do fine. I did fine! For someone who's never been in a relationship, he's doing a damn good job. \n In regards to his best friend girl person, she is still in the picture. She actually broke up with her boyfriend last week and he's been offering a lot of support which I can understand and don't have a problem with because I trust him 100%. The facebook conversation never did come up in real life, but it's obvious to me (at least) she outwardly does not like me. For instance, we all went to the bar the weekend she broke up with her long distance bf and towards the beginning of the night she ""accidently"" spilt her drink all over my dress. She was all giggly and apologetic about it, but the way it happened in my opinion was no accident. No worries though, the night was young so I jumped in my car and grabbed another outfit. \n Other than this, she tends to try and make me look stupid in the large group I'm now a part of (because of Link) with people I don't know super well by calling me out on my opinions and such. She can be really dense so this often backfires, unfortuneately for her. She does other stuff I haven't mentioned, but pretty much it all goes down to me getting to know her, and finding her to be a  MASSIVE ATTENTION WHORE  so I think she's just butthurt about losing a large percentage of that from my now boyfriend. \n I haven't bothered Link with any of her more recent actions since I can totally handle myself and it's really not affecting our relationship. I'm sure she's a good person at heart going through a tough time right now, so I've let a lot of her behaviour towards me slide. \n Anywho, I hope you guys enjoyed the update!"	Everything's fine.

"This may get a bit long. Been with this girl for ~4 years, and I honestly truly love her. I had planned on proposing as soon as I got a better job. I was 100% certain she felt the same way too. Well two weeks ago we had a bit of a disagreement (nothing huge by any means) about her texting other people all the time while I'm trying to have a conversation. I thought we worked things out fine but a few days later she called me up and said something along the lines of ""I don't think we're meant to be together"" and dumped me. I was heart broken, but heres where it gets interesting. \n A few days later while I'm still trying to grasp why she broke it off over something so stupidly simple she admits that ""it probably wasn't the right time to do it [break up] but I felt like it was coming anyway. I miss you and really want you in my life, just not as a boyfriend."" Now yesterday I got a call from her, she's hysterical because she just spun out and hit a side barrier with her car (she's a shitty driver) and she ""didn't know who else to call."" So I of course dropped what I was doing and raced to make sure she was ok. We ended up sitting in my car for two hours waiting for a tow truck, just talking about things, mostly reminiscing about our past and all the fun things we've done. \n Now today we really started talking again and somehow sex came up. One thing lead to another and I ended up bringing her to my house for ""breakup sex."" She looked pretty emotional during it, more so than usual, but I didn't really confront it. We went out to eat afterwords and reminisced some more. I tested her by talking about other girls and noticed her getting jealous. By the end of the night she decided she'd still like to have sex with me and was adamantly against me sleeping with anyone else. I left it at that and here I am. \n From my standpoint it appears she isn't so sure of herself for breaking things off the way she did. My question to reddit is, am I doing the right thing here? I love her, I've forgiven her in my mind for dumping me and I've made some changes to be a more appealing boyfriend as well. I want to get back together, should I approach the subject again and risk whatever foothold I have? How do I go about this?"	GF dumped me pretty much out of the blue, keeps talking about our past still, still wants sloppy sex, can i get back with her? \n edit  Thanks for the replies, I appreciate the advice. Sounds like there's zero chance of a favorable outcome for me in this situation. Time to move on I guess.	439	54	relationship_advice
So... this is my first post on reddot in general. Sorry if there are any mistakes, if I left out some details you would like please ask. \n So my bf is away for quite a long time. When we're together he isn't too insecure for me to deal with and because we are together it is easier to stop him from being jealous/insecure. But it's been a few months of us being long distance and because he is so busy he can't pay as much attention to me as he used to. I've told him this is perfectly ok and I understand why he is so busy and I am not bothered. So where thereal problem starts is I have this friend who is m (20) who I have been friends with since he was in grade 9. We are just friends and he is seeing a girl anyways. But my bf gets uncomfortable when me and friend hang out together. I tell him when we hang out together so he knows I'm not keeping anything from him. But my bf gets all weird and quiet and I know he's actively trying not to be jealous or controlling or whatever. So we talk about it and I guess I was a bit of an asshole when I explained to him that I wasn't going to cheat on him and hadn't.  So now things are strained between us and he won't open up to me anymore. I want him to tell me how he's feeling and I apologized for being an asshole amd I've told him everything I have told you guys here but I know I've hurt his trust. \nSo I guess what I'm asking is this: has anyone had to deal with a jealous so in this way? How do you reassure him/her and how do you earn trust back?	need to reassure SO I'm not cheating and regain his trust to share his feelings	311	15	relationship_advice
"23/f] My boyfriend [23/m] (of about a year) has said all week that he would come with me to see my very ill grandfather in the hospital; however, instead he has chosen to run errands or see friends each time I've gone. Most of my family is not here, and he is my main support system. The night my grandpa went into the ER, I texted certain family members asking them to tell the family they were with. My bf got on my case for not creating a group chat to let my whole family know at once what was going on. When I told him I had it taken care of, he ended it with a sarcastic ""ok, fine"" and got up to go to the bathroom. I burst into tears. All I needed was support and not to be told what I was doing wrong. I went home and asked him to come. He showed up two hours later. \n Tonight, he mentioned he wanted to go with me to the hospital. I told him I was going, but he said he couldn't because he was running errands. He said we'd meet up later to drink and do homework. When I got home an hour later, he was already at his friends' house drinking (going on drunk). \n Things have been way off lately. Valentine's day was a mess. He went through the motions of buying me flowers and attempting (but forgetting) to buy me chocolate ""because girls are supposed to get flowers and chocolate on Valentine's day."" I don't give two shits about the commercial holiday. But I had a nice night planned because I wanted a day where we could celebrate each other, but he mostly seemed interested in telling me how awful the holiday was. He did, however, make me a very cute card. \n A couple weeks ago he brought up a time (when we had broken up) that I went to go visit a male friend. Granted, I had lost my virginity to this man years ago, but we were simply just friends and would never be anything more. When my bf found out after we got back together, he freaked. Pretty much insinuating that had I cheated on him...(we were broken up at the time, so even if I had had sex with my friend, which we didn't!, it wasn't really his business). But we talked and moved on. But then he brought it up last week. And got angry with me all over again. And then he was upset a few days later because he had a dream about me having sex with other people...he got angry at me for something I did in HIS dream. He got over it. But I didn't. \n I'm tired of letting myself down easy by inviting him to things but expecting that he won't show (this is not a new thing). We've had so many ups and downs besides that, and we've gotten past a lot of them. But now these times are just piling up in my memories and making me wonder what I'm doing. \n I didn't touch on any of his good qualities. And I promise, there is a reason I'm dating him. But I need help in how to approach all of this. I need help getting my head on straight."	My boyfriend has trust issues and has been removed in supporting me when I've needed him most.	556	17	relationship_advice
ITS HIGH TIME THAT YOUR BOYFRIEND START BEING HONEST WITH YOU! While his lying about this could be indicative of his ease at lying to you in general I wouldn't automatically assume that. People lie every day, most likely including you. What's the difference between a white lie and a serious one? If the liar doesn't see it as something that bad they won't have any guilt about it and it will likely be effortless. You wouldn't get worried about his ability to lie if he told you how beautiful you look on a day that you knew you didn't look your best. Same sort of thing. He likely thought he wasn't harming himself nor your so it was no big deal. How you move on from here should be based on whether you're willing to be with someone who uses marijuana or not. He's demonstrated that it makes him happy and that he's willing to hide it from you. What's to stop him from placating you with a promise and then breaking it in a short period of time after he thinks you're no longer suspicious. \n You say that he is kind and loving, spoils you etc. Was he doing this while high? Maybe his depression stemmed from not having a supportive partner. Not all people that use marijuana are lazy stoners. I smoke (well, usually vape) and work 40-60 hours a week in a corporation as an engineer. I've gotten nothing but great work reviews and have steadily been climbing the ladder. For years I didn't smoke because an ex didn't want me to. After I broke up with her I took it back up and its decreased the amount of alcohol I drink (which is only on the weekends, but still has a lot of empty calories) and even lots a few pounds. \n He shouldn't self medicate, but that goes for anything whether it be alcohol, marijuana, pills, hell even WOW or similar outlets. It's one thing to use something to relax and enhance life, it's another to let it consume you.	He should stop lying to you and you should decide if you can be in a relationship with some that uses marijuana without being judgmental and negative. If you can't/don't want to do that, then end it because he's going to do it again. Might as well try to force someone you love to be a vegetarian.	345	57	relationship_advice
"We met at the beginning of May and hung out/talked several times a week throughout the summer. And it was fantastic. Best summer I've had in a very long time and he was definitely a huge factor in that.It was almost perfect. We both admitted that we had strong feelings for each other but he said he didn't want to ""rush"" into a relationship considering I go to college 3 hours away. I felt like we had everything but the title, but a part of me agreed that I didn't want to do the LDR. Fast forward to when I left for school in mid august, we talked on the phone maybe twice the first few weeks I was away and then after that nothing. We kept going back and forth with phone tag. I got tired of it so I stopped trying. 3 weeks ago, I went home for the weekend and he wanted me to come visit. So I did. And it was nice, but he kept talking about how much he missed me, and the entire time I'm thinking ""bullshit"". After I went back to school, we didn't talk at all. I texted him suggesting we facetime sometime and he said he was too busy. So at this point I'm kind of sick of putting in the effort to try to make this thing work. Since we're no longer talking regularly I don't know how to confront him about it. But at the same time I do still have strong feelings for him and would hate to just have everything go to waste. We've had several conversations about the status of our ""relationship"" and I'm ready to have a final, definitive one, but I'm not sure how to go about it. Any help?"

He had this problem before we started dating, but he got a bit better as we got closer. And now it's just gotten terrible. \n He literally does not know how to listen. I'll be in the middle of a sentence and he'll interrupt and start talking about something else or just go do something else. It really, really annoys me. \n And I want to talk to him about this. But every time it happens, I get really angry and frustrated that I know if I try to bring it up, it'll sound like I'm accusing him and I'll be really mean :/ I need to try and calmly talk to him about this, but honestly I don't even know if he'll listen long enough to get my point across. \n And so I've gone to other I friends to get the attention that I feel like I deserve or something ... I don't know, but when he interrupts me and it annoys me enough, I'll text one of my guy friends and tell him whatever I tried telling my boyfriend :/ I don't want it to be like this. \n So..

How old were you when you got married? You may have grown up and settled into relationship patterns at the same time, which is common if you were married in your early 20's. It just takes work. \n Also, kids change who you are and how you relate to each other. Counseling can help you sort it out and see your biases - counseling doesn't mean that you're going to be able to 'fix' things, but it can give you less-biased opinions on where you each stand as people and where your relationship itself needs work.	A good counselor will help you see a way forward in the relationship. Find a good counselor.	95	17	relationship_advice
My friend and i are very close (both males).  Being with my friend makes me question my sexuality because he is the only person male i've ever been attracted too and he is straight (all of my friends believe he is bi). Recently i've wanted to come out to him because of how close we are. A lot of people think we are already in a relationship because of how close we are. we play around a lot ( cuddle and say that we are a couple, yeah this has became normal for us) which makes me think that he actually would say yes if i asked him if he wanted to be more than friends.

"Okay, I want to try to offer some perspective. \n Lots of men make excellent husbands and fathers.  Lots of men would be awesome to spend your life with.  Every breakup is heartbreaking, even the nasty, abusive ones.  The fact that it's hard doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.  Hearts heal. \n He isn't ""The One,"" and I know that because that's not how people work.  There are lots of guys you could be happy with.  You're only 20, and you've been with this guy since you were 18.  He's your first and only lover.  You've never had to break up before, and this relationship feels like it's life or death because you don't have the benefit of having gotten over an ex, only to find yourself alive. You are very young, in my opinion, to be settling down and deciding that you want to be with someone you're not attracted to sexually for the rest of your life. \n Also, the issue isn't your ""anxiety over sexual attraction"", the problem is your  lack  of sexual attraction.  That's a huge aspect of most relationships, and shouldn't be discounted or dismissed lightly. \n The question you need to answer is whether or not you'd be happy never having sex with anyone else for the next sixty years.

"I met this girl about 2 months ago. We started hanging out, then went on a couple dates. Our first date we ended up just talking for almost 5 hours till the restaurant we were at closed at 2am. It looked promising. Our last date, almost 2 weeks ago now, was not so great (side note: the first time we hung out, she invited me, and she initiated this date as well). We went to dinner and couldn't hold a conversation for more than a couple minutes. Then we went to a party, which was a bust and we ended up having to give her roommate a ride home, who was super fucked up and said she couldn't be alone, which kinda killed the rest of the night. Since then I have talked to her almost every day, through texting, and she always responds, and with big full sentances not just ""k"". But everytime I ask if she wants to go out or do anything she either has an excuse why she cant or just straight up ignores the invite. Is she tryin to give me the hint or playing hard to get or what?! I'm at a loss here. What's my next step? Should I straight up ask if she likes me or not?

We married in 2011, been together since 2006. Both each others first boyfriend/girlfriend. Both virgins when married. She's never been big on physical touch, but has come a long way over the years. At first touch was absolutely absent from the relationship. Eventually she became more and more comfortable, and we took a love languages evaluation and she saw I needed physical touch, so she made an effort to open up to it. She now loves me to play with her hair or rub her back anytime possible, and will reciprocate in some way usually, which I know sounds like nothing but for her it is. Even so, she has very little to no sex drive. Has felt forced or done out of obligation whenever we do have sex, which is monthly at best. Lights always out, same positions, never any sense of enjoyment from her side (which makes me feel just great, as you can imagine). Don't think she's ever had an orgasm, period, definitely not during intercourse. She was home schooled and lived a somewhat sheltered and conservative life. Has had little exposure to sexual things before marriage, if any. \n Anyway, all that to tell you that today she dropped the bomb on me that she thinks I deserve someone who will desire me, that she loves me as a best friend but not as a lover. Wants to separate. Doesn't want to see a counselor with me because she doesn't feel comfortable sharing details with anyone, but I am still working on this with her. She doesn't respond well to my positivity or hopefulness, reassuring her that we've come a long way, I'm in this for life, I love her and want to be with her, I have faith it will get better with time and effort, etc. She insists I deserve better and doesn't want to waste any more of my life. I think this is just how she is wired, with low libido, and it isn't reason to end things. I think with time and effort we could continue to make progress, but I understand that takes willingness on both sides. \n I'm shocked and heartbroken. Fully expected to be with her the rest of my life and start a family soon. She says she had to say something before kids came into the picture.	"Been together for 8 years, married for 2.

"I'm not sure how to word this but I'll do the best I can. I often doubt myself, and dwell on negative things really easily. For the past few months, I've been stuck on whether or not to break up with my boyfriend of over 2 years, because of my doubts of my feelings towards him. \n This is the last thing I want to do. We have so far been very compatible with each other. We have similar interests, a very good friend group, and he's a truly wonderful guy...he treats me well and is my best friend and my rock.  If I had to pick out negatives, I suppose he could be a bit more social and creative; he doesn't have the best imagination in the world so cute things are  few and far between nowadays. \n We tried the whole long distance thing, since it was my first year of college and it was about an hour and a half away, and it was honestly the hardest experience of my life. I did nothing but doubt my feelings towards him, which in hindsight was ridiculous because other than not seeing him every day, nothing had changed. He wasn't making as much of an effort as I liked with the whole texting/skype thing, but in his defense he had class every day too. But because I dwelled so much on ""Well is this worth it? Does him not being around make me not as interested?"" that I began believing it. I was also going through severe anxiety and depression, so that never helped. \n So I come back from school in a severely defeated mindset... I got to see him all the time again, but the memory was 'tainted,' if you will. I only saw the negatives of our relationship for months and being back didn't help because it was so burned into my mind. \n It's never been as bad as it is now. On occasion, during the week leading up to my ""woman time,"" it will get worse and I just become hopeless. I think that might be happening now, but it's still a horrible feeling. It brings me to tears almost every day, because I care about him so much, and he's such an important person to me, that the though of falling out of love with him is honestly horrifying to me. \n I guess what this comes down to is this...are there any things we can do to make us connect better, or to rekindle what we used to have? Little things, nothing like HOW DO I FALL IN LUV WITH A GUY, just things to kinda 'spice it up.' Any advice would be appreciated. I'm willing to try anything because he's such an important person to me and I'm putting my all into this."

Hi /r/relationship_advice, \n I need your help. I think I have come to the end of a friendship with someone I once considered to be a very good friend. I feel like I either confront him with my issues which will likely completely destroy the friendship or say nothing and let the friendship die. \n The backstory: I went with my brother and said friend to a rather expensive concert one year ago today. Friend (lets call him Patrick), Patrick said that he was short of money and could not afford to pay back my brother for the concert ticket and so would get the money in a couple of weeks. One year later he still hasn't paid. I'm not worried about the money (my brother doesn't need the money) but its the way he has conducted himself. His actions over this year and the fact that he has done this to a member of my family that lead me to feel this way. \n I have asked him twice for the money this year both times he has told me that he is completely broke but will be getting money in a few weeks to pay. The problem is when he is out with me and others he cannot help to boast how well his business and family are doing (saying to friends he has done x deal and earned x money), he has been on trips to the US and India during this period yet does not have the money to pay back my brother. \n As I said previously its no longer about the money its about the disrespect and disregard he has had towards me. I think I wouldn't feel so bad had Patrick done this to me, the fact that he has done this to my brother has compounded my feelings towards him. \n This past year we have drifted apart because we have been living in different locations (I went off to get my degree), and so we have not talked in the way we use to since we went our separate ways last year. However, now we are living close together again it becomes a problem as we have a large group of friends that we share. I have had to back away from these people as I have started to feel I don't want to be around Patrick and I feel if I were to fall out with Patrick I would lose these friends/they would pick his side as he was the person who introduced me to them. \n So lovely people, What should I do? Should I confront Patrick letting him know how I feel or avoid this and just try to slowly disconnect myself from him and that group of people? I feel the only way I could save this relationship would be to confront Patrick, but if I were to do this I think he would not react well.	Friend did shitty thing a year ago, I let my feelings fester as we grew apart but now we are living closer together i don't know whether to confront him or not. \n Thanks to anyone who reads or comments on this!	484	41	relationship_advice
"This is a long wall of text, and I apologize but I have to set it up. \n I was in Vegas last week with my grandfather, who is 88 years old and it was his last wish to see Vegas before he passes away. Anyway, we were at Paris casino, and I sat him down at a ""Casino War"" table (easy game).  The dealer was female, really nice, and made a monotonous game very fun for everyone involved.  I know it's their job to be nice to people, but she seemed genuine.  I think she respected that I took my grandfather there, and she was very fun to talk to.  I didn't use to believe in love at first sight, or in this case ""friend"" at first sight, but for some reason I was very attracted to her personality... and I had to talk to her again. \n Anyway, of course she took all his money, and I tipped her out of my pocket.  I walked my grandfather back to the room, and vowed to return.  So I went back, and she was standing there all by herself.  I made sure she wouldn't get in trouble for just talking to someone before we started talking.  It was small talk mainly, but she was still engaged and I didn't want it to end.  She mentioned she hated her job, that she was moving back to LA, and that she was single. (Was that a signal?  She could have lied and said she had a boyfriend or something).  Then, she went on break and we still talked up until the point when she went into the break room.  She left and said ""Maybe I'll talk to you after my break.""  But we never did... \n I feel like I should have gone back and talked to her but I blew it.  But there's more... I am married.  I am not looking to hook up with her though.  I just liked talking to her, and I could see us being good friends even across the country.  I looked her up in facebook, and messaged her with a fake account because I was afraid she might get the wrong idea and email my wife.  Since we have no mutual friends, I think it got blocked or ended up in her ""other"" folder.  So then I used my real facebook account to friend request her... I explained that I just wished I had gotten a chance to talk to her again after her break, and that it would be nice to talk again, purely as friends. \n I haven't heard anything back, but I can't stop thinking about her.  I am not a creep or a forever alone, but damnit, I feel like I'm letting someone go that could be a lifelong friend if I don't persist a little more.  I am a little torn if she views me as a creep right now, or if facebook has just been filtering out my messages because we have no mutual friends.  What do you all think I should do?  Give up, or try some other method of contacting her?"	Met a vegas dealer who I really want to be friends with without it seeming like I, a married man, am a stalking creep.

"When my bf and I got together I was at my highest weight: 185 pounds at 5'10"". I was very muscular, had just finished college as an athlete--I wasn't perfect though, as I had gained weight over the summer and was probably 22% body fat. Over the past few years,I've stayed in shape with all kinds of cardio, circuit training, and lifting, and regularly run marathons (ran sub-3:30 last year!). At one point I even worked as a fitness instructor for a year. I've lost weight consistently and have maintained at about 150 (reminder, I'm 5'10""!) and 18-20% body fat since about 2012. Again, I'm not perfect, but I can at least faintly see my lower ribs and abs and I'm a US size 6. He's been mostly the same weight throughout, with little blips up and down for crazy work times or extra workouts. I work out more, but he's definitely fit and it shows--more so than I think it does for me. \n I gained about 10 lbs while home for three weeks this summer because visiting family and all that entails. I lost it within the month of August when we got back and am currently in the high 140s and at my lowest weight. I'm still interested in losing weight because I'd like to be around 130 for running and aesthetic reasons. My bf is always into the idea of me losing weight, to the point where times that I've gained a few pounds (usually from going home) in the past have been our only real fights. I was starting to get a little  too  into calorie counting (hello sub-1000 cals/day), so I decided to step back from that and try keto. This is where things got a new kind of difficult. \n He's very much in the ""fat makes you fat"" mindset, but we've worked around that by framing it as a science experiment. I'm loving being able to eat again without feeling guilty, and am already losing weight. The only problem is that he seems to think I'm going to get fat and it seems to be his biggest concern. I told him about the calorie-counting craziness and my reasons, including that I'd lost my period for the past three months and am worried about my bone density. I want to lose weight, but it seems to be  hugely  important to him in a way that scares me. I'm starting to have those ""will I ever be good enough"" thoughts. \n He's a wonderful bf. I love our life together, our partnership, the things we do together, and him. Breaking up isn't the solution--we're totally happy other than this. I just feel like I'm either deluded (actually super hideously fat) or doing something wrong in my framing of this...but every time he sees me putting a bit of olive oil on my brussels sprouts he looks at me like I'm murdering his cat. \n For those of you who have wanted a partner to lose weight, what made you feel like they did what you needed? For those of you who have lost weight knowing your partner wanted it, how did that work out? And if anyone can speak to either one with a keto doubter, I'd love your input!"

"I have been dating my boyfriend for almost 6 months and I feel as if our relationship is going downhill. When we first started dating I could tell he was just as excited to spend time with me as I was with him, whether it was a date or just staying in. I don't get that vibe from him anymore. We went on a date last night and when I first came over to his house beforehand he was just saying things to me that were about me that made me feel stupid and when I didn't respond or look at him he kind of stopped and then was a little nicer. Then when we went on our date and it was fine at first. We were talking for a while and then he just kind of stopped trying to make conversation. Doing that in itself is hard to do. He will tell me about his day or about how something in his life is going and when I try to do the same he just kind of mocks it. It's the times like this when I think I just annoy him and he doesn't really like being with me. But then there are times when he acts cute and hugs me and wants to give me affection in public even when he knows it bothers me and then I think maybe he does really like me. I constantly wonder if I'm doing something wrong or if he can pick up that I'm insecure about our relationship and I'm the one sabotaging it. In my head it's a constant battle of ""Don't be clingy and give him space"" vs ""You're only not texting him/having fun with him because of imaginary problems you're creating in this relationship so maybe let go that mean thing he said and have fun."" It bothers me that it takes him almost two hours after he says he'll come over to invite me over instead. And it bothers me that he has stopped saying and doing cute and considerate things like he used to. Sometimes I feel like he only wants to be with me when it's convenient for him. What can I do to encourage getting our relationship back to the way it used to be?"	I feel like my relationship is going downhill and I don't know what to do about it.	381	17	relationship_advice
I knew this girl when I was in late middle school and we were good friends for about three years until I moved away. I went back to visit her once when I was a freshman in high school and we had hung out and even told each other that we liked each other but not much happened after I left. I recently managed to meet up with her because I was in the area visiting some family friends. So I messaged her on Facebook to see if she wanted to get together and she said yes. We had a great time together and what was just old friends hanging out quickly turned into a date. I even ended up kissing her at the end of the night. We live in different states a few hours away from each other and are both attending college. I have kept in contact with her through texting and we even video chat sometimes. We have also been planning on meeting up sometime soon. I want to pursue a relationship with her but I do not know how to approach it because it sounds a tad crazy to me. I am not even sure how girls feel about long distance relationships in college. Any advice on what to do? Thanks in advance for any feedback!	Knew girl in middle school. Moved away. 5 years pass. Went on date with her. Kiss. There is distance between us. We still talk. Should I pursue a relationship?	221	29	relationship_advice
First of all, I have very little experience with relationships. My previous longest relationship was only 6 weeks. \n So I have been seeing this guy for 2 months and I really like him. Things were going well up until yesterday. I was meeting one of my female friends for drinks and she had mentioned that she was also inviting a guy she had met online. The guy was entertaining a friend from out of town and would only come if he could bring his friend. So my friend needed a wing-woman. \n In the spirit of full disclosure to my boyfriend, I asked him if he would be offended if I went to drinks with my friend and we ended up meeting up her online interest. I just wanted to have a discussion. If it was a problem I would have tried to get another one of our friends to wing for my friend. \n My boyfriend did not take to this question very well. He basically shut down communication, stating that he did not have the energy to discuss this. I told him to contact me when he had more energy. We haven't communicated since. \n Was I wrong to ask him in the first place? \n I really hate the fact that he shut down communication. Is this a bad sign of things to come? Should I end things before we get much deeper? \n I just don't know how hard to try in this relationship. \n Edit:  I did also mention that there would be other friends joining us later.  Does this make it seem less than a double date?	Tried to be open with bf and it seemed to really offend him, and he shut down communication. Did I screw up? or is this just a bad sign of things to come?	267	33	relationship_advice
We've been together for 2 years, 4 months and 26 days. \n Our 3 year(s) is one April 27th. \n Well, the first year or so was fine, euphoric, possibly. \n His parents didn't have much of a problem with me, everything was good. \n For the past few months though, since maybe December, they've essentially been brainwashing him. \n He's attempted to break up with me twice since the beginning of the year, saying he's not happy with the tension between myself and his parents. \n The tension started when his parents said to him, something along the lines of my mother isn't a good parent, and could've raised me better. \n I found this to be quite insulting, as I didn't grow up with a father. \n They barely know anything about me, other than what he's told them. \n That's not my fault though, considering they're trying to dictate our relationship and I'm not too fond of that idea. \n I've been to numerous dinners with them and attempted to talk to them, but they don't pay me any mind whatsoever.. \n His parents started making up 'house rules' a few months ago. \n They started with all these bullshit rules, after his dad walked in on me showering! \n For example, my boyfriend uses his dad's truck; They started making up 'rules' like he can't have the truck out past 11:30pm or overnight. \n Another example; I'm no longer allowed to stay the night at his house. \n They say that if there was ever a fire, they wouldn't know I was there, blah blah blah.. whatever. \n He can't even have a lock on his bedroom door, without them having a key to it, for fucks sake! \n There's so many more, but far too many of them to type! \n Okay! \n Back to the brainwashing.. they've continuously told him that I'm no good for him, because I go to an alternative school, haven't graduated yet, etc. \n I have yet to graduate because my school is only twice a week for a few hours, like really, what do you expect? \n They've also said our relationship is one-sided, because I'm currently unemployed, but it isn't like I'm not looking for work! \n I honestly didn't have a problem with them until recently, but seriously, they're trying to break us up, and it's frustrating as hell. \n It's not only his parents either, but his sisters too! \n I'm just so damn tired of it all, but I really don't want to lose him.	Boyfriend's parents and sisters are trying to make us split by brainwashing him, saying I'm no good, etc etc. \n Didn't have a problem with them until they insulted my mom's parenting.. \n It's frustrating as hell! \n I'd add more to this post, but I'm pulling a blank because I'm absolutely fuming. \n Any and all advice is appreciated.\n Long sigh	406	58	relationship_advice
I suffer from fairly severe social anxiety. My SO knows that I'm very shy, but I don't think he's ever suspected that it's anything more than this. So far, it hasn't caused any real problems in our relationship, at least outwardly. He seems to accept that I'm naturally very quiet and don't like to talk a lot. I still make an effort to spend time with him and his friend group, even though I'm very uncomfortable, and up until I graduated from college recently I had a friend group with whom I would invite him out occasionally as well. \n However, I feel like I'm constantly going through an inner struggle because of my anxiety. I have very low self-esteem, for one thing. Participating in activities with his friends is usually an incredibly difficult and painful experience for me, and this makes me not want to go out with his friends even though I often still force myself to. It even makes it difficult for me to spend time alone with my boyfriend sometimes because I often struggle to make normal conversation, and usually feel badly about myself. He doesn't seem to mind my introversion, or at least has never brought it up as an issue in our year together so far, but I'm worried of the long-term effect these issues will have. \n Up until now, I've never mentioned any of this to my boyfriend. I'm thinking of going to see a therapist about this, which I know I've put off for far too long. But I don't know if/how I should tell my boyfriend. I know it's something I probably shouldn't keep secret, but I'm afraid of unloading all of my emotional baggage onto him. Any advice on how to bring this up?

M 30's - 29/F. Everything started off great, we went out about 10 times, slept over at each other's place, had great things in common, but differences to keep it interesting. \n When I asked her about  her previous relationships, she said she had basically been single for a couple of years but had dated on and off. I figured she was ready/safe to possibly get serious if things were to progress, and that it was worth pursuing. Then about 3 weeks ago she mentions that she had dated someone for 4 months who left back in February. He had to go over seas on a deployment from the military and it broke her heart. She said he did do something that destroyed her trust with him as well, but aside from that, they were good together,  she wasn't over him, and didn't know how she would react when he returns in two months. I drew the line in the sand and told her that I knew enough to know I wanted things to progress and didn't want to wind up getting hurt when he returned - wasn't going to set myself up like that. She said she didn't want to hurt me either, her heart just wasn't open totally to anyone else right now because she wasn't over him, but didn't want to not be friends (at least for now). She admitted she knew she should have been over it by now, but simply wasn't. We agreed to part ways. \n The last thing I told her was that I was sorry things turned out this way, sometimes timing in life is just bad and do look me up if/when she found peace and or wanted to try again, slowly, etc. We really got along famously and she showed many obvious signs of wanting to be with me when we were dating. She even said, I'm the only person she has dated that was on the same level regarding her interest, but she couldn't stop thinking about him even though it was 8 months ago. She said they still contact every now and again, though I don't know to what degree. \n I've been dating other women and have other opportunities, but no matter, for some reason I can't get her out of my mind....

How do the rest of you deal with feeling jealous?  Specifically, how do you deal with your jealousy for things that you can clearly recognize (when you think rationally) as being totally innocent?  Things like your significant other mentioning talking to one of their opposite-sex friends, or meeting up with them to catch up and grab drinks.  Things that are innocent that you probably do yourself, yet you still feel jealousy.  Or feeling jealous when you see them interacting with one of your friends. \n I sometimes find when I first feel jealous I just get really quiet and in a bad mood for 5 minutes, and do my best to hide it.

"So, any idea of how to introduce the sex again to her? \n First thing you have to know : it'll be long. Not necessarily difficult (although you'll need a real self control), but i believe she needs time. It demand a long term investment, and the payback isn't always here. \n There is a difference between physical pleasure and sexual arousal, and there is a gradation. So you have to read her corporal response and her mental response. Yes, she was aroused, but wasn't mentally ready for what you did. \n You could begin with a lot of exciting non-sexual things. Hug her. Rub her back, massage her feet, palms or arms. Kiss her a lot, her neck, her ears, her lips, etc. The longer the better. And stop at this point (if she want, let her do the same thing). \n Tell her that because you don't want to force her, you'll be waiting for her explicit signal. You are respectful of her body, her wish, so she have to tell you or show you what she want (for example she take your hand and use it). But emphasize about the ""it's totally okay to wait and take things slow."" \n Try to improve the pleasure you give her, learn her responses, know each inches of her body. Does she prefer a gentle rub on her shoulder, a caress on her forearm, a light scratch on her back? Listen to her and try to tame her. \n Yes, it does not lead to orgasm, but it seems that she'll have to learn a lot about pleasure. And so do you. See it as an opportunity to learn a lot about about your gf, and women in general. \n And if there is one thing that make it work, it's to talk a lot. \n Because 1) you want to reassure her and 2) you want to know what make her fantasize. Not that you should do it (because there is a difference between imagination and reality). You do it because talking about sex is the first step : understanding what she feels, build trust, suppress the discomfort, help her to know her body, create a great relationship... \n So, step by step : \n \n 0 : you talk to her. your relationship, what she want, what you want, what you like in her,... (don't hesitate to compliment her, make her feel beautiful, strong, independent...) \n \n 1 : you talk to her about what she feel. Why she acted like that, how she should learn to say ""no"" when she think she is not comfortable (and that it's okay with you to say ""no"") \n \n 2 : you talk to her about sex. What she imagine (the first step, her first time,...). What she want. How can you make her something she'd love. And don't make fun of her, she has to know she could trust you. \n \n 3 : physical proximity, you make her comfortable \n \n 4 : physical contact, you learn to know her body \n \n 5 : progression, you let her guide you/tell you when she is ready \n \n \n (6-99 is ""repeat the step long enough and build something with her"") \n \n 100 : Yeah ! Great for you, she's totally open with you now! Have fun! Take the lead if she want, you know her, and now you can talk about ""what does rapistallthesudden like?""  \n \n You should do all theses step all the time (not just step 5 without 4, 3, 2, 1 except if she have said something clearly). \n I know, it's kind of sad that ""rapistallthesudden"" is only in the 100th step. For most girl (more confident/experienced), there is a real reciprocity from the very first step. But sometimes, you have to bear with it."	Talk. Learn. Cuddle. And profit.	615	5	relationship_advice
I live in a foreign country, and will likely continue to live where I am now for at least half a decade, maybe more. Because of cultural differences it seems incredibly unlikely that a relationship would ever work out with a local girl, much less that we'd have much in common. I'm not ruling it out though. \n So I've been going to local meetings of foreigners, and have pretty much met all the local expats. I'm a pretty shy person and I'm sick of going out to the bars where we meet, but I'm making friends and occasionally having opportunities to hang out in more intimate places, which is nice. \n But a couple days ago, I started feeling really worried about ever having a girlfriend. As I said, I've pretty much met all the foreigners in the area, and among them, I only really immediately felt comfortable around one. Turned out we have a lot in common, too. We went on a couple of what I thought were dates, just us two, I was starting to feel infatuated so I mentioned how comfortable I feel...and she apologized and told me she's gay. \n This doesn't really bother me, I was getting a little carried away, and it's silly to expect anything so soon anyway...okay, it kind of does bother me, only because I've always sort of wished I  were  a woman, but that isn't my issue. \n The thing is, as I've said I've pretty much met everyone I can, and if anything I want to go to less of these awkward (for me) meetups, but I haven't met anyone I felt I'd like to date. It seems like there simply isn't a suitable person in my city, and it's difficult to imagine going the next five years without at least pursuing romance. Is it normal to feel this way? Should I try to be more open-minded about meeting local women? Should I try being a bit more friendly with some of the other foreign women and see if something might develop, even if we don't have a lot in common on the surface?	Met all the girls in the area, only liked one of them, turns out they're gay, and now I'm worried there isn't anyone  left  to meet.	352	26	relationship_advice
This is so frustrating. I met this guy in 7th grade and we've been hanging out ever since. We're seniors now and my parents never had a problem with me hanging out with him. However, today my mom found out that my friend's mother is a lady who she used to work with about 10 years ago. And my mom HATES her. My mom said that it's because she is this [ethnicity] so she's a bad person (e.g. she would give me drugs, put bad stuff in my food, etc). Then she told me that I shouldn't hang out with him 'cus he would be the same. Sadly, my mom is wrong, because he's pretty straight edge and his mom isn't anything my mom is saying.  :\\ What should I do? \n Yeah, I'm 18 but I only turned 18 a month ago. I don't have a job (yet), so I can't easily move out, haha. Which means...I still have depend on them. :\\ I just think this is ridiculous because I've always done well in school and call them whenever I'm going somewhere. I just...don't know.

"I'm typing this from my phone so please excuse any errors. \n So she and I have been together for 10 months. We have been through a lot in that small amount of time including 2 ex BF and 3 ex GF trying to interfere with our relationship. Through it all we have stayed with eachother because we make eachother happy and love eachother. However, I have moved away recently and we no longer have as much physical contact as before. As such, we have been getting more frustrated at eachother recently and have had 7-9 fights a month compared to our 1-2 fights a month. I have spoken to her about our arguments and she has told me that the long distance has nothing to do with it and she wants to be together for as long as we can. She said she needed me. This worries me a little because she seems very dependant on our relationship and me. I feel like we are growing apart. I care about her more than you or she will ever know and I value her as a person involved in my life. I don't want to lose her, but I also don't want to continue to be in a relationship with her. To top it all off she wants me to attend her homecoming in a few weeks. I know that there is no way to get throughythis without me hurting her, but given her past of abuse I don't want to set her off to make irrational decisions. She is really just a great person in my eyes, but in her own she sees herself as something that doesn't deserve anything. She thinks that I'm the best guy that she's been with, which I find entireIy ridiculous but she insists on it.

Hello reddit,\nI'm a 19 year old guy and am currently in a relationship with a 18 year old girl. We've been together for about 7 months now. \n However, I'm not able to meet up with her very often because she lives a while away from me, but we usually see each other about twice a week. The thing is, recently, she met someone who works across the street to where she works, and she has had her lunchbreaks with him a few times. They started talking on facebook and exchanged numbers. \n Now, she had this plan she wanted to do without me knowing it. It's actually something I asked her to do before, and she did it back then. She told him she was in love with him and would like to be in a relationship with him, just to make him admit he had feelings for her. When she noticed he actually did have those feelings, she said to me what happened. The rest of her plan was to tell him that it was all just a gig. But this time she won't tell him that and keeps texting and chatting with him and I think she texts him more than me. I don't know what they say to each other, because she won't tell me and when I ask questions she is wary.

"My ex boyfriend and I broke up about 2 months ago because I was horribly miserable. He did not want to devote time to me, I felt like his last priority, he did manipulative things to make me sad and I was always depressed even when I was not with him. I decided to end it and I knew that's what was best. However, he was my first boyfriend, we met when I was 16 and we dated for over 2 years. We talked every day, all day and we even long distanced for 10 months prior. So, cutting him out of my life completely proved difficult and I found myself still talking to him almost daily even though we had just broken up. After a couple months of space, we started to hang out again and my justification was that we were ""just friends"". However, we started hooking up again and I developed old feelings that I did not expect to. We definitely had an unspoken understanding that we were still in love with each other, and he said it out loud a few times. So fast-forward a couple weeks: We are supposed to hang out saturday night so he can give me my birthday gift and a letter. Saturday comes and I do not hear a word from him, he ignores my calls, and I end up going out with my friends instead, after being royally blown off. At 2am that night, he called me and said he ""No longer wants anything to do with me"" and that we should never talk ever again. He said he wanted to be alone and that he has been going through ""psychological issues"" that he refused to tell me anything about. He hung up the phone, blocked me on all social media, and that's the last I've heard from him. Two days later, I unknowingly went on facebook only to see that he is in a new relationship with a girl whom I had asked him about a few weeks earlier. He added me back and made his profile public so that I could see it specifically. Since then he has been posting pictures of them together almost every day and saying things like ""when people tell me that sleeping with someone else to get over a breakup doesn't help, that's the biggest lie i've ever heard"". I feel like I am getting this stuff waved around in my face constantly and it's killing me. I know it's probably silly, but I can't shake the feeling of being replaceable and unimportant. I mean, I think this is what he wanted it to do. So, reddit, I am coming to you with advice now on how to move past this.

Hello, I have been dating my girlfriend close to 4 years now. She recently brought up having an open relationship. We went into our relationship being completely monogamous and had no intentions of doing anything else. She is in her mid twenties and I am in my early thirties.  I was immediately opposed to the idea because I feel like I know myself well enough to know that it would be an emotional disaster for me. \n She thinks I have not taken enough time to make a decision. She has only been with me and is curious about having sexual relations with other men. The thought of her being with other guys makes me upset, uncomfortable, and inadequate. I have taken an additional couple days to think about our relationship and her feelings towards this but I still feel the same, I don't want any part of an open relationship. \n When I explained this to her she told me that I wasn't an equal partner because I made my decision too quickly. I feel like our relationship has been severely affected by the suggestion of the open relationship and has already started making me feel insecure and anxious. Should I consider the idea of an open relationship or is our relationship over? It's hard to think of any other outcome, if she stays with me and agrees to not having an open relationship, will she resent me and possibly cheat on me without telling me? At least she was honest with me about what she wants but that's the only good thing I can pull out if this mess.	my girlfriend wants an open relationship after 4 years and I don't, what do I do?	269	16	relationship_advice

So I'm at a total loss as for how to handle my current situation. My wife [29] of two years discovered that I looked at online porn. She discovered this about a year ago. To help compound the problem, she was pregnant with our first child at the time she found out. Our child has just turned 4 mo old, so this problem has been ongoing for some time now. When she first found out, I got scared and lied about the whole thing. I was caught, and knew it, but couldn't own up to it completely. About a month ago I came completely clean over the situation.

Think I maybe her 4th partner (married/together with ex for 20yr). \n She is very loving and considerate and I love her but the sex life is making me unhappy, but I don't know how important I should be considering that to be in terms of us being 'later in life' with other priorities. \n When first started seeing each other, lots in common, same activities, travel etc. Sex was decent not amazing but I figured we are both older.  The level of attraction I felt wasn't high, but all the other good aspects of our relationship seemed to outweigh that. My last two long term girlfriends have both been about 8-10yr younger, had quite a healthy amount, which I enjoyed. \n Now we are maybe having sex once every 2 or 3 weeks, quite perfunctory unless we are both drunk then it is a bit more impulsive. I realise I just do not enjoy physical intimacy with her anymore. \n It feels like when I initiate it, she needs to immediately take the upper hand, go on top, and be the dominant one. Which as a male I find quite difficult to handle. If we kiss in public she puts her hand being my neck in what also feels like she is being dominant. In short I'm afraid I feel emasculated whenever there is intimacy. \n I wouldn't say I was the dominant type, it's not what I set out to be, but as a man it feels natural to exhibit dominant behaviour in a mf couple (rightly or wrongly I guess).  I am unable to do that in this relationship. \n I've told her that I find the way she kisses me to be uncomfortable for me. I will talk this weekend that I feel like she is taking the male role which I find very difficult to see as acceptable, but am v confused by. \n Last night I initiated sex and after a few mins of me fooling around,  she wants to push me into the bed and be in charge. When I respond more dominant, as if it's a push-pull, she would not relinquish control.  I immediately lost interest, and really struggle to be of any use. It is difficult to remain aroused. \n At this age, does sex become 'different'? I feel like we should have a healthy sex life, and I enjoy sex and still fantasise about sex with other girls to get aroused so I can engage with her which doesn't feel right. \n We are planning on living together v soon and this seems really tough to get over.	I feel emasculated in our sex life, and unattracted to partner. Should sex still be an important factor at this age?\nThanks all	464	23	relationship_advice

hey guys, here's the situation:\nme (f19) and my brand-new bf (m21), have an issue with communication. he's a busy guy- we're both in college, and he also works part-time (bordering on full, some weeks). and he suffers frequent migraines. (i know, this is getting good).\nnow, we were dating for almost two months before we became official. during this time we went on a couple dates and i stayed over a few times. he was hesitant to begin a relationship after his last ended badly, but i figured i'd give it time. \nhe's always been a bit lax on responding to texts and his fb time is almost nonexistent. days would go by and for whatever reason (and there were always legitimate reasons: bad migraines, lost phone) i wouldn't hear from him. when he did text, we'd make plans and get together and have a great time. \ni put up with the difficulties in the hopes that if and when we became 'official,' he'd realize that he needed to step it up and stay in touch. unfortunately, he asked me just before our winter break and as of today, we've been on break 11 days. five of them, i've heard nothing from him... but once again, there were always reasons (although this time a bit less understandable and more because of a lack of thought, i.e., phone died without charger, apparently no internet, and.. a lost phone? maybe.) i think this relationship has a lot of potential, but how much waiting is too much? have i given him too much slack?	new bf sucks at staying in touch and making me any sort of priority. what do?	262	16	relationship_advice
Short story first; \n    I met my bf[21] at my workplace 6months ago and since I met him, I knew that something gonna happen between us. He's from another country(Australia), he came to my city - first just to visit it, then he realized he's gonna stay here just because of me. Few weeks later, we ended up in bed --we didn't have sex. After that, we started to hanging out/dating. He met my whole family, my friends and so on. We spend lots of time together. I let him take my virginity, which was one of the best decisions in my life. \n    The main thing is that; he's half australian, half dutch which means that he cannot stay in my country for the long time because of the visa thing. We were so nervous because of him leaving and stuff, but we found a solution and somehow he got his dutch passport (his dad is dutch). It means that he can stay in my country bit longer than few weeks. \n    But the problem is that, he needs to move to Netherlands just to prove them that he seriously wants to get the citizenship. I don't mind him leaving, Netherlands is so much slocer to my country than Australia but not seeing him everyday may be difficult. We've already talked about it that we're gonna visit each other but some of my friends are against it. They say that I should break up because it won't work. On the other hand, others say that I should. So can I find anyone here who's got almost the same problem like me? Someone who has actually done the long distance relationship? I'd appreciate any kind of advice.	My boyfriend needs to leave my country because of visa/citizenship and wants to do the long distance relationship but I'm kind of scared..	284	23	relationship_advice
"First we were in long distance relationship, but after few months I finally moved and now we live together. Before we were in two different countries. My problem is when she has some bussiness to do in another country (or just visiting her family) and we can't see each other for more than few hours. \n I trust her, so it's not problem with ""she's gonna cheat on me"", if anything it'd be probably me being insecure and not confident enough, I'm not in constant fear of losing her, but I know there are better looking guys with better life perspectives, who also (in my opinion) would gave her more fun in life - I'm calm, she's more of ""crazy"", in short - she's more of Pinkie Pie, while I'd be Fluttershy ;) I don't think I'm having problems with her fidning someone, because, well... she doesn't have many really good friends there. \n It's just me missing her so much I can't focus on anything. I work on late shifts so everyday I came home she was sleeping, sometimes waiting for me, even if we'd see each other only for couple hours a day (work, sleep, wake up, 2hrs of free time, repeat) we'd still do. Even when she is here I can't stop thinking about her, trying to come up with new ideas how to surprise her, how to make her smile, but now, when she's ""gone"" for a week (yes, only 7 days), I can't do anything - I nearly always make breakfast for her while doing for me and now I won't do anything, I have problems sleeping unless I'm seriously tired because she's not next to me, etc. \n She changed my life, I'm really happy to be with her and I know that without her I'd be sad person who never smiles because I'm a bit pessimistic and it's she who told me to look for good things even when something bad happens. \n She says it's nice that I miss her so much, but she's sad that I'm overly sad, she ""fears"" going anywhere for longer periods of time because she knows how my week will look like. \n I have some hobbies, I could fill my time with those things, but even if I start doing something, after 10 minutes I realize she's not there and all my motivation goes away. \n I wish I could change my behavior, I understand the problem is in me, but I don't know what to do with it."

My first year in grad school has been insane (and not in the tons of reading kind of way). I've been slandered and threatened, my rooming situation is difficult, and I had to bury one of my good friends from undergrad. Luckily I made a few really good friends in grad school to get me through these terrible times. Every now and then, I felt like one of these new grad school friends was pushing my boundaries (always wanting to be around me) but I figured it was because she took friendship seriously and because I've been an emotional wreck. \n Fast forward to this week, when I first got back from my other friend's funeral, this new friend (24/f) asked me how it was and I told her I was still upset that my other friend was dead. She tells me not to be sad because I still have living friends. This does not make me any less sad, but I try not to be too hard on what she said since she'd never had a friend die before. Then at some point in the conversation, I mention that I planned to help my boyfriend go car shopping when I was on break. She then insisted that she come grocery shopping with me because it wasn't fair for me to shop with him but not her. Later in the week, she got mad at me and another student for having a conversation without her, claiming we were purposefully ignoring her. \n Then, on Thursday night, this same friend (24/f) asks me if I can take her to work early in the morning. This past week I've gotten no sleep between being stressed about my own work and residual depression/anxiety from everything that happened this semester. I told her I would do my best to wake up but that it will be hard for me to do it. Later that night she texts me saying that she is going to get a taxi instead which I thought was a great idea. I happily go to sleep. Then, I notice that I don't see her for a couple of days. I decided to send her a text to check up on her. She texts me that she's feeling sad. I told her I would come to wherever she was so that she wouldn't have to be sad alone. \n As it turns out, she felt very betrayed by the fact that I didn't drive her to work and questioned whether or not I cared about her and our friendship because of this. She told me that she expected me to fight her on taking the taxi by offering to drive even more strongly. She then cried and left the room. I felt terrible because I had no idea this one event would mean the end of our friendship. Deep down I know she's a good caring person, but I don't even know how to go about repairing things. So I have two questions: \n \n What did I do wrong? \n How do I save this friendship?	Overbearing friend feels I let her down and questions our whole friendship.	510	12	relationship_advice

"okay Reddit, here's my problem.. \n I'm a 25 year old female, and in a 3.5 year relationship with a 26 y o male. \nBefore this relationship, I had several 1 year long or a bit more very intense relationships. Usually pretty dramatic, overly lust-y, over the top, really. Moved in quickly with guys, 18 year old me even got a matching tattoo with a boy that I thought was ""the person"".\nSo I got all these dramatic relationships out of my system and one day had a one-night-stand with a boy who was very shy (opposite of me).  I'm not sure what lead to us properly dating but it was probably just alcohol and lots of it, and him losing his shy-ness through that.  I don't know if I was instantly attracted to him but it definitely became that way after a while.\nThe shy-ness is important, because I'm not shy and want to talk everything-absolutely-everything through and this boy does not- he's very private and very personal. \n So fast-forward 3 and a half years- He doesn't ever include me in when he talks about buying a house, it's him wanting to make an investment in his life.  After three and a half years I don't even have a ball-park-figure as to what kind of income he's on. \nI guess those things make it seem like we're not in a partnership as such, where we look out for eachother and make decisions together- we're no different to people who just started dating, except we live together. Rent, bills, everything split down the middle. \n So I sat down this afternoon and told him all this- that it doesnt feel like a partnership, that I don't see a major committment on his half- but when I tried to explain it I made it sound like I just wanted him to pool all our money together (and I'm pretty sure I make less money than him and I'm terrible at saving so this just makes me out to want his money. \n Isn't there a certain vulnerability that you need in a long-term relationship? To know that someone else wants to combine everything and not worry about looking out for their own investments and whatnot? Or am I just seeking that need for that gushy-dramatic-all-in-or-nothing stuff that I had in my previous relationships?? \n For some reason though, whether it makes sense or not, I feel like this is a relationship-ender and while I dont want to break up with him I don't feel there are other options, because to change these things would be changing who he is."	my bf wont tell me how much money he makes, I feel like after 3.5 years that I have a reason to be sooky about not sharing things like this so I got my knickers all in a knot about it and now we're about to break up.	434	48	relationship_advice

I met my boyfriend two years ago after he moved to the US from England for work.  We immediately hit it off.  We have an incredible relationship and I am very much in love with him.  I've been to England with him several times to meet his family and friends, and he knows my parents well. \n The only problem in our relationship is figuring out our long term plans. He wants to move home to England to be close to his family, who are a huge close-knit group.  I completely understand this because I want to stay near MY family (which consists of only three people).  We don't need to move any time soon, but I'd like to figure out some sort of plan before we get married.  How do couples with separate families do this? \n We are both close to our families, but in different ways.  His is outwardly-loving and traditional.  My parents are a bit nuts, but they are great people.  My dad is ill (cancer, diabetes) and my mom has a serious anxiety disorder.  I feel like my little brother and I are all that they have.  They have no friends or hobbies and look forward to our visits more than anything else. The guilt I would feel if I moved to England is more than I think I can bear.  That said, I can't ask my boyfriend to abandon his family either. \n Also, our careers aren't exactly conducive to living in England.  I'm a nurse and from the research that I've done, nurses get paid much less there.  Also, my degree wouldn't transfer easily and I might have to go to school all over again.  He works in the games industry, and there aren't many options for his specific type of work. \n We are normally decent at communicating and being honest with each other, but this topic is just too heavy for us to handle without getting upset.	My boyfriend and I are from different countries and both want to settle down near our own families eventually.  How can we get on the same page so that this dilemma doesn't blindside us when the time comes to figure it out?	322	42	relationship_advice
"Hi. \nSo I don't know really how to help except to say that I recently left a 6'6"" guy for a 5'6"" guy and I'm totally obsessed with him. He even has a very average short man penis. I love love love him and don't care at all that he's short. The important thing is that he is confident. He is very well-dressed, which I think helps him feel better about being short, though he has never expressed any anxiety about this. He has great posture, and he is well spoken. I regularly wear 6inch heels when we go out (I'm 5'5"") and he seems totally cool with it. In fact, he says ""I have to wait in way less lines when I'm with you!"" haha. I think what makes him so sexy is that he just doesn't care! But it probably helps that he has other things to focus on and be confident about such as his clothing (kind of hard when you're 20, as he's older and $ is no object), his fitness, and his intellect. SO yea just try to focus on an area you excel and trust me when I say that your girlfriend means it when she says she doesn't care about your height. If anything, I love when people look at us in public (i.e. when i'm wearing heels/towering over him)... it makes me feel sexy and powerful, and it makes him feel super lucky to be with such a catch!"	be sexy in other ways, your gf still wants to jump your bones.	247	13	relationship_advice

OK, so ill try to make this as short as possible. As a quick back story on me, I'm 32 and have been out of the dating game for quite some time. I had a string of bad relationships and decided i needed to take a break and work my own shit out, which went great and I'm awesome now, but I seem to have neglected the concept that a break is supposed to end. Up until a week ago I hadn't had sex (or any intimate contact) with a woman in 5 1/2 years, and my last relationship was 7 years ago. Anyway, that back story is needed to understand my total ineptness. \n So I just recently finished nursing school, and through the entire 2 years I've been good friends with a girl we'll call Becky. Now Becky and I have never had any romantic feelings expressed between the two of us, and while i considered making a move when I first met her there hasn't been any thing since that time until recently. \n So New Years rolls around, we had just graduated nursing school, and we have a small gathering at Becky's house. Long story short, she and I end up fairly drunk at the end of the night and have sex. Now first off the sex was awesome and 100% consensual. I stayed the night, we made breakfast for a couple of her friends that were over as well, and I eventually had to leave. So that is the backstory. \n Its now been a week since it happened, and we haven't said anything about it or brought it up at all even though we've hung out a few times and we text a lot. \n So here's my question, should I bring it up to her so we can discuss what happened and if it means anything or if it was just drunken fucking? If I should bring it up, how exactly should I broach the subject? It's been so long since I have had sex of any kind, and my last relationship lasted 2 years, so it has been nearly 9 years since I've had to deal with anything like this so i feel completely idiotic trying to figure out what the rright approach is on this. And since i know it will be asked, yes I would be interested in a more serious relationship if she were up for it. \n I apologize for any odd spelling things or grammar stuff, typing this on my phone while it is having issues.

I have been with my bf for 10 months. We are an hour apart. Besides for him, I have no transportation, friends, or any connections to the real world until I graduate next year. I stay with him for a week or two at a time. I do love him a lot. \n He has always been somewhat of a liar. Example: when we first started dating he claimed he had sex prior to me with two girls with full detailed stories. 2 months in he fessed up that I took his virginity. I shrugged it off. \n At the start of our relationship there was a coworker of his that flirted with him. One day while talking to me over the phone on break, she came up to him and started talking. He hung up on me and didn\u2019t call back until 15 minutes later. I got very mad at him for it. He said he lost service. \n Eventually bits and pieces and lies came together through time about what happened while he hung up on me. This is an extremely brief version of it: A month later he admitted that she invited him to a birthday party. Then another month later, it was so they could party and do pot brownies together. Then a few months later her number appeared in his phone. He made up 50 different lies about that too. Then two nights ago (9 months in) he accidentally blurts out that he had her number all from the start, since that day he hung up on me. \n My bf might be a pathological liar, despite how awesome he can be. I don\u2019t think there is anything to be upset over the exchanging numbers thing but I am mad that he lied for so long, made up so many stories and he is only sorry that he got caught. I love him and I think I would regret leaving him, especially since I have no one to talk to in real life. I might try harming myself if I stay alone. Of course no one is perfect but the problem is he lies and trust is one of the foundations of a relationship. \n I cannot think through this straight. I have not eaten in 2 days. I am doing poorly with school. He apologizes non-stop and says he wants to change. I kind of don\u2019t know if I should believe him? HELP. I need a solid, mentally stable person to help me think through this. I wrote down the whole coworker story for my memory so if you want more details just ask me (2 pages). \n Maybe he lied because of me? Maybe he is too intimidated by me? He is too afraid to be honest with me? I asked him calmly so many times to tell me what happened and each story he would say that it was the truth. We have tried discussing this.

So reddit, what do I do? I wanna believe that we""ll get back together but I feel like shes just trying to put me in the dreaded friend zone. Do i keep talking to her hoping for the best, or do I just get over her and move on?"	girl tells me we need to be better friends, i dont know what to do.	183	15	relationship_advice
"I have been single for about a year now, and have recently discovered that I have codependency issues. I have always known that my self esteem was low and that I have tended to have problems telling anyone no because I was a ""people pleaser."" I was shocked after reading literature on codependency, because the characteristics are incredibly similar to my own. Although I am not in any formal relationship as of now, I have tended to be involved in various casual relationships where I substitute the sex for the love that I seek. This has been a pervasive problem since I was 15. These sorts of ""friendships"" only aid in my feeling of self hatred as I wonder why I am not worthy of anything more than a sexual pal, and cause me to wonder what is wrong with me (i.e. why doesn't anyone love me as much as I love them when I put in all of my effort/try to do everything righ). Whenever I do meet a potential new partner, I tend to do one of two things: reveal my whole heart and 'fall in love' almost instantaneously as I rely on them to mend my deeply rooted issues or other times, I hold back because I am so afraid that if a person knew the 'real me', they will leave me, just like everyone else has in the past. Either way, nothing seems to work out and I blame the problem on my personality not being good enough or on the other person not having enough compassion to care about a 'broken' person. \n I know that these thought patterns aren't healthy, but I don't know how to go about forming a healthy relationship. I go through bouts where I try to completely isolate myself so that I do not have to face the rejection that I know is imminent. And then trying to fill the emptiness in my heart, allow myself to be subjected to unhealthy relationships simply to sustain some sort of human interaction. I am aware that self esteem has a lot to do with my problem, but I have absolutely no idea how to fix low self esteem."	I do not trust that anyone will love me for me, and so I tend to only involve myself in relationships that lack intimacy so I do not face the possibility of rejection. Does anyone have advice on how I can go about breaking this pattern?	365	46	relationship_advice
My entire life I have had the annoying habit of falling head-over-heels for guys. As I've gotten older, I've gotten a lot better at not being the annoying tag-along that just wanders behind said person and makes puppy dog eyes the whole time. However, I have a bad tendency to relapse into this behavior when drinking. \n The other night, I was having a rough time and decided to have a few drinks. One thing led to another and I drank more than I intended to. Around this time, I decided it would be a good idea to start texting my guy friend about how horny I was and how much I wanted to have sex with him. Even if you think this is flattering from an attractive woman, it still gets annoying when it goes on and on for about 2 hours. When I started sobering up and reading what I sent, I started hoping that I might die of embarrassment. \n Long story short, my friend hasn't talked to me since said incident. I think I pissed him off by pushing the subject way past pleasurable. My plan is to just let it be until he says something, but I'm just wondering if anyone has found something useful to say in this type of incident.	I'm an annoying occasional drunk who spent the other night sending raunchy messages to a good friend. Now he is (understandably) irritated and I'm wondering if anyone has advice as to what to say other than Let it Be.	215	39	relationship_advice
Dear /r/relationship_advice, \n I'm typing this post in the hope of gaining some insight into the cultural differences of my relationship. This particular issue is related to my SO's [25/m] family. \n I [23/f, Caucasian] have been with my SO for two years and we've lived together for seven months. Overall, our relationship is fantastic and he is the best partner I could hope for. I'm quite family-oriented and close with my parents despite me living abroad (UK). My SO is a British born Chinese and he has quite a lot of family in UK, including his parents and two elder sisters. They live about a three hour drive away from us. I have met his Mother and one sister once when they visited us a few months ago. I've met his other sister twice. My SO visits his family for a couple of days approximately every six weeks. \n I like that my partner is in good terms with his family and obviously I understand that sometimes it's nice to spend time with your nuclear family only. However I do feel puzzled at times of why I'm always excluded from these visits and it does bother me I've never been to my SO's childhood home, considering it's not  that  far away. I would also like to meet his Dad and I've asked a number of times when it'd be possible but the only answer I get is 'I don't know'. My SO has never invited me to go with him either. \n One reason I can think of is my SO and his family think it's awkward to spend time with me as the parents don't speak English and I don't speak Chinese. I'm also wondering if it's a problem I'm not Chinese. I have asked my SO this directly and he said it isn't a problem but I don't know what to think. \n I guess what I'd like to get insight into is why it seems like I'm not welcome to spend time with my SO's family or whether I am being out of the line somehow (e.g. perhaps it's just not something that is done in the Chinese culture). I'd appreciate any helpful comments on how to bring this up with my SO and perhaps stories from your life if you have similar experiences. Thank you!	I feel excluded from my (f23) Chinese SO's (m25) family activities. Am I making a big deal out of nothing?	385	20	relationship_advice

So like I said, my gf and I will be separated by a 3h drive this semester. At first I thought, no big deal; we could only see each other every 1 or 2 weeks for the major part of our relationship. \n She, however, is very nervous about this and fears that this year in uni will mark the end of our relationship, that the distance will kill our feelings. \n The thing is, I had an appartment before, which is not the case now. I'm going to stay at the residences in uni and she's in the same situation, plus, she is forbidden to bring people from outside in the residences. While it's not as strict where I'll be, it's not like being at your own place. Also, I'm selling my car because I need the money. Seems like we're going to see each other less often. \n We are both willing to make it work out, and it is why I come here for advice. \n For those of you who are in a similar situation, how do you keep the passion alive when you see your loved one no more than twice a month?	How do you maintain a relationship while away from each other? \n PS: I x-post this to /r/relationships and /r/LongDistance	194	19	relationship_advice
Throwaway account, yay! \n I am a college student. I have been with my girlfriend for almost a year now. It's fun, the sex is good but there is a problem. Well besides normal couple problems (she is the jealous type but not too bad), there is a girl from my hometown that has always shown interest in me. We dated for a while (3 months) but we called it off because we were not sure that a distance relationship would work. Because of this, there was not really a sense of closure. There was not really a break up. We still had feelings for each other, even after I left my hometown and dated several girls before meeting my current gf. Whenever I come back home, I would go watch a movie with her or have ice cream as friends but recently it feels like she is still in love with me, and it got more complicated when I met my girlfriend and started a relationship with her. Hometown girl still wanted to go out to the movies with her even knowing that I have a girlfriend. Now that I am back home for the summer, hometown girl is really excited and might want to see me. I love my girlfriend a whole lot, but I'm afraid that old feelings might resurface if hometown girl keeps insisting. I actually think they are already resurfacing. What should I do? My gf and I almost broke up twice for unrelated reasons and pregnancy scares, should I just do it for good next time and go back to hometown girl? Should I ditch both and look for another SO? \n (You are free to say negative things about me, like I'm an asshole for thinking this, or stupid because going back to an ex is stupid)	I love my girlfriend whom I have been with for almost a year, but ex is stirring things up. I do have feelings for her. What do?	302	27	relationship_advice
I have been dating a girl for 10 months. 2 months ago she went to student exchange program to another county for half a year. I knew about it since very beginning and was happy for her. \n Everything was fine, I visted her, we talked every day, until last few days when she told me she stopped loving me. My first guess was that she met someone, but she keeps telling me she didn't. And maybe I am naive but I believe her. I am going to see her next week and I don't know what I should do. \n Before she went she was afraid that she's the girl who needs to see people, otherwise she easily forgets them. \n Guys please advise what I can do.

Hi Relationship Advice, I made a throwaway for this post. Here goes - \n I met this girl about a year ago (year ago) and we hit it off on a night out together. We subsequently went on a date a week later, then another date the next week followed by her coming to visit me (I live in a different town) for a date followed by her stopping over at mine. We had sex, kept in touch for a couple months then the whole situation kind of ceased. Which we were both fine with. \n 4 months later, we bumped into each other on a night out again, she came back to the house where I was staying, we made out and stuff but never had sex, she said she wanted to see more of me. The next week we went on a date and I slept at hers but nothing happened. She was kinda cold with me infact, which was completely the opposite to the signals she'd been sending. \n Anyway, she tells me shes going on holiday with her friends soon but I later found out it was her boyfriend sorta guy, who she failed to tell me about, so I decided not to bother anymore. Then a month ago, she got in touch again saying we haven't spoke for a while, how I should come see her and she misses me. Next time I'm in town she booty calls me, however I'm too drunk and just fall asleep as soon as I get to hers. We kept in touch and were texting like every day. She asked me to come see her again when I was in town, but we got our wires crossed and couldnt meet, so she booty calls me at 5am again. I'd unfortunately done some E and couldn't perform once again, she laughed about it and said she wants us to go on an actual date next time, which I am totally down for as I feel like I owe her. \n Now this is where it gets kinda weird, whilst I'm with her she tells me she's going on holiday with her ex and another couple in a few weeks, and that they booked it when they were together. I obviously feel really uncomfortable about this as I've started to really like this girl and kinda wanna make things more serious and official. She also showed me that her boyfriend has been calling her/texting her fairly often and shes been ignoring him/being cold with him when possible. \n Now I'm kinda stuck here, we're nothing official, but its obviously worrying to me that she's going away with her boyfriend, who definitely seems still interested in her. She's said that she's not interested, but even if she isnt, I can see them at least having sex (I think they're sharing a bed). I don't wanna ruin the friends with benefits type situation that we have going on but I wanna tell her I'm worried about her going away with him, yet I don't feel like I'm in any position to do that. I wanna take her out before she goes so she knows I actually do care but I don't wanna waste my time/get upset if she goes away and then gets back with him. \n Any advice here would be great cause I'm really stumped about what to do, i've caught feelings bad. \n Thanks guys	FWB type girl is going away with her ex boyfriend on a holiday they booked before they broke up, I wanna make things serious but I'm worried to ruin the FWB situation // scare her off.	568	36	relationship_advice
"This is kind of a long setup, I apologize in advance. \n About a year and a half ago, I had been accepted to a university, and was living in my hometown as part of a transitional phase. Spent some time with some old friends from high school, reconnected with, at the time, (20/F) friend. I expressed interest in dating her, she kind of beat around the bush for a few days, figured she wasn't interested but didn't want to hurt my feelings, so I said hey, no big deal, and hit the road. \n Started university, met a great (19/F), dated for about a year, moved in together towards the end. I was forced to leave the university and go back to my hometown after getting laid off and running out of funding. When I left we decided that it would be best to split up, and reconvene in a few years to decide our fate after I dealt with the financial stuff and could get back to the uni. It was foggy though since we still said I love yous and what not. \n Back home, started martial arts again, found a job almost instantly, things going great, started hanging out with old friend again only to discover that she really did want to date, but didn't know what to do since she hadn't seriously dated anyone before. We went on a few simple platonic dates and I decided it was worth another shot. I get a message today from the ex saying ""Please whatever you do, don't date or do anything sexual with (friend)."" \nFollowed by the usual, can you visit soon, and so on. \n I'm not really sure what to do here. When we split, we made it clear to each other that dating other people was okay, it was an actual breakup. I'm not sure why she would single out this one person in particular. I really like this girl, but I would feel wrong dating someone when I still say ""I love you"" to an ex. Am I scummy, or just ignorant? \n Edit: Sorry forgot the"	If I left someone I cared about due to life circumstances, should I stay away from dating until we can give it another shot?	349	24	relationship_advice
"It seems to me that this is consistent with her modus operandi.  She's restless > she makes a bad decision > she learns it was a bad decision > she corrects the mistake > repeat.  No doubt her flakeyness is frustrating for you, but at the same time, you were friends for 8 months, and dated for 18 more; you had seen it first-hand, and weren't ready to break it off.  Now you're ready to be done with her.  Be careful you're not letting your (justified) hurt make a bad decision for you. \n You have to understand this is who she is, but having flaked out about your relationship, I'd rate it unlikely that she'll do this a second time.  This is her (admittedly reckless) learning process, and she's taken her lesson in 4 days or less.  She has shown you that she undoubtedly wants to be with you.  Think about the courage required to come back after what she did - that takes balls. \n You still care enough to be mad and have doubts.  If it was really over, you would have told her it's over and been done with it, not in here asking for advice about when to start dating again. \n I'm looking at myself in this and wondering wtf I'm doing.  My standard line to people in relationship_advice is usually about finding the right person for them, aka moving on.  Something in this makes me think you two are right for each other, though.  Be careful you haven't picked up her bad habits, and go off flushing something you actually value because of a momentary feeling. \n If I were you: I'd talk to her about how hurt I was.  I'd tell her that if she really wants to be with me, she has to understand that I'm working for the family business, may do so for the rest of my life, and she's got to accept that.  She also has to realize that she can never do that to me again - once seems to be necessary for her, but twice will be a violation of the trust you're putting in her. \n If anything about that talk doesn't sync up, walk away.  She's not there because she's right for you, she's there because you're ""right"" for her.  And that doesn't play."	She's a flake but you knew that.   She flaked out on you, and you're hurt; don't let the hurt make you flake out on her.  Talk to her before you decide. \n Good luck.	385	33	relationship_advice
"Ok, so ive been seeing this girl for a couple months now after pining over her for some time. Before we started dating i thought she was absolutely gorgeous (still do) and I would do anything i could to ""accidentally"" bump in to her just so i could have a reason to talk to her. \n Well here we are several months in and shes been everything i hoped she would be and more. She makes me breakfast, lunch and dinner. At dinnertime i soemtimes cant make it over to her place till pretty late some nights and she wont eat till i get there.

Lastly...sex wise....simply put....amazing. \n The issue is, i always find myself losing interest once the chase is over. I've got this girl and now im not so sure its what i want anymore and it would be stupid of me to walk away.

We're just acquaintances really...small chit-chat nothing to serious. I've caught her checking me out on several occasions though and its got my mind completely torn. Im with this great girl and if i walk away i may lose one of the best things to ever happen to me in exchange for a girl that may turn out to not work at all or who may be the opposite of the one i have. \n I feel like im always looking for something better though... What i have right now is already light years ahead of any girl ive ever dated. Is this normal for guys? should i ignore these feelings and stick with it or does these mean something more?

I dated this guy a while back. I liked him, but he'd just broken up with his girlfriend and it seemed like he wasn't ready to make a commitment. I also realized that maybe he was just a little cocky and flaky in general. Recently, I made a tinder account and matched with him out of curiosity, and he sent me a flirtatious message. I asked him how he was, and he asked me how I was doing. The conversation pretty much ended there. \n It seems like he hasn't really changed at all. I think it was a mistake to open up communication again. Should I unmatch him or would that just make me look pathetic? I'm not really good at this dating thing.

you don't like him; so leave him. \n i would also like to say that it's not a bad idea to have a long distance relationship what only exists in name (if you don't like him, you're not going to try very hard).

"I'm having issues with my mom, and she isn't getting the message that I would like her to be a bit more responsible. She was in a 4 years relationship with a really cruddy guy. While she was with this guy, she took up smoking and drinking. On one occasion I came home to a foot sized dent in the door and a hole in the wall from a thrown shot glass.  About a year ago things started getting rocky: He would threaten to leave her, she would beg for him to come back. He left for good a couple weeks ago, and my mom took up drinking and smoking again. (She had quit a couple months ago when she had a close medical call.) We're broke now, so she says we ""have to be responsible with money"", yet she still buys cigarettes, alcohol, and soda. Here's my dilemma. My dad gave my mom the house in the divorce, so he lives in his parent's basement temporarily. He gets more money than my mom, and pays for a lot of my expenses AND child support. The laws in my state are pretty screwed so unless my mom willingly gives me to him than she is my primary guardian. I don't feel safe with her, but i'm not in enough danger to consider calling CPS.

Good luck finding anyone in this world without at least one issue.  I think it's going to be more a matter of picking your battles, or picking your issues.  There are well-adjusted girls out there.  But being 22, that's still young, still college age, still figuring things out, still trying to figure LIFE out.  You might not meet the right girl until later.  You'll probably have to search for a while until you find the right one.  Blah blah, all the cliches about relationships you always hear but they're mostly true.	Don't settle for less than what's reasonable to expect.  If you're looking to settle down, maybe aim for someone older with a steady career and a steady household.

Hey r_a, I have a scenario that I doubt you get to see very often: \n I'm backpacking on a 12 day trek in backwoods New Mexico with 11 other people. 8 of which are male (15-19M), 1 father (45+ M) of 1 of the boys, and the parents (45+ M&F) of 2 of the boys. I'm the only girl (18F) of the group, not including the mom. (btw, this is boy scout affiliated coed group) \n Everyone in the crew has either their brother or parent here with them, except for me. This makes me feel depressed, especially since I will not be able to talk to my parents for 12 days straight (no cell signal on the trail). I can talk to them as of now, seeing that we are just at base camp currently. But tomorrow will be the first day of the 12. \n Now here are my problems! I have pretty bad anxiety and it's been going off a lot due to being far away from my family, and then I have this anxious fear of possible death/injury while hiking (silly, I know). The anxiety gets really bad when I'm alone and at night, which works perfectly due to being the only (single) girl and thus have to be alone in my own tent. And I'm too embarrassed to talk to about my anxiety and depression to the adults here....because I am an adult. I'm almost 19 for fucks sake. \n My second problem is that due to being the clear minority, I've been getting a lot of shit. Now, I know most of these boys pretty well, and 2 of which I've been close with for 6+ years. But being the only girl in a huge group of immature, alpha-hungry guys....it changes from fun to hurtful awfully quick. Now, I am all for messing around and goofing off (hell, I swear and joke more than any of them), but it can get nasty. The boys (not the adults) have made a few sexual jokes involving me at me, some sexist comments have been made, and then misc teasing in my direction. And while I can easily stomach all of that (I chose to be here afterall), I do have a breaking point. And while I'm sure that this shit will soon die down once we actually go trekking/backpacking and be around the adults more... The issue is that I'm clearly going to have to fight for respect here. But I don't have the slightest clue how.. \n If I can't get their respect and have them back the fuck off, I'll feel as if I need to put myself at a distance and pretty much isolate myself to avoid further emotional abuse...and then I'll get depressed and won't be able to discuss it for ~12 days.	18F backpacking with 8 boys (15-19M) who outnumber and thus don't respect me...also too embarrassed to discuss recent anxieties with the adults.	467	22	relationship_advice
OK so this is a post about something that just happened with my mom. Just a little back story I have been caught with weed one time by her and I was drug tested regularly and grounded for a while. She is very strict when it comes to drugs. So I work a part time job and am a senior in highschool. I went on vacation last week and brought 200 bucks along which my mom saw. Now this week she asked me to go and pick up some dog food. I told her that I had recently gone on a shopping spree and had spent most of my cash. In reality I spent the majority of the cash on some boomers and had spent the rest on food, clothes, etc. She then started to question me on what I bought specifically and I gave her a list of things but sort of cut her off saying that I can give her money when I get paid in a couple of days. She then said fine and I went to bed. Now, I'm seriously freaking out and have no one to talk to. I know that this isn't exactly a good situation on my part but I really need advice on how to handle this. I feel like I really fucked up here and I don't know what to do. I am just super nervous about her finding out and having a huge fucking meltdown. I can't be open with her because she'll actually lose her mind but I seriously need some advice to calm myself down. She is completely insane when it comes to any sort of drug and will overreact horribly. Sorry if this is kind of jumbled but I'm sort of having a paranoid fit and could use some advice.	I think I made my mom suspicious of me using drugs and I'm very paranoid and don't know how to handle it.	303	22	relationship_advice

"When there's a problem in your relationship, he's turning to an ex for comfort rather than talking to you about it. \n He doesn't see your intelligence, but judges you in a negative light intellectually (which will harm your confidence, exploration and intelligence). \n He tells ""random people"" that he's going to break up with you. This is disrespectful and shows that he has one foot out the door. \n He keeps you guessing. He makes you doubt your worth. He gets ready to bolt and then when you're tired of being taken for granted, dude professes undying love. \n To summarize: \n \n He makes you doubt yourself. \n He puts you down. \n He isn't committed for the long-haul. \n He disrespects you. \n He doesn't communicate well. \n \n I get it. You have this dude on a pedestal. You offer him unconditional love, empathy, and understanding. And, reading between the lines, you're afraid you won't find someone you like (and who likes you and connects with you) if you leave - and you're afraid you won't find this kind of sex and attraction again. \n And that's exactly how someone continuously taken for granted, continuously trained to take the blame and let others off the hook, would feel. \n Close your eyes. Picture 10 years from now. He's telling random people maybe he'll get a divorce. He's turning to close female friends for ""comfort"" because they ""understand him."" You're on edge, wondering how smart you are, wondering what else you can do for him. He tells other parents he wishes his kids were better at sports, smarter, etc. And you're never exhaling fully, breathing easy that he's going to always come through and be around. \n If that sounds good, stick with it. If not, there are tons of dudes out there who are good at fucking, open-minded, respectful and much better at loving. Ask yourself which you want - because this dude's gonna not only take your time, he'll damage you and THAT will take time to heal. He's not that special. You just think he is because you are. And so long as you keep making that obvious, he's going to lower your self esteem until all your specialness is eclipsed."	GTFO.

My girlfriend and I have been together for almost 2 and 1/2 years. We're both 21 and both have had previous sexual relationships previous to this one. We first had sex about 3-4 months into the relationship, and would stay together at least 3-4 nights a week. This lasted until roughly 10-12 months into the relationship, when sex started to become less frequent. This never bothered me because I assumed it was part of the natural progression of a relationship and tbh I could make do with occasional sex with this girl. She has always admitted to being a little close minded in her sexuality and is incredibly self concious about her body, which is pretty opposite to myself. Anyway, there were a few events in quick succession in her life that seemed to put her into a bit of a rut and since then it has been a struggle to encounter anything sexual with this girl. We have talked openly about the possibility of her having depression, but regardless of this she refuses to see anyone about it or try to help herself in any way. It has gotten to the point where it is a major struggle just to get her to make out with me. \n I have tried to be supportive, I've tried to be understanding of any issues she may be having. I understand that in order to enjoy sex you need to be in the right frame of mind but there is a serious limit to how long you can stay in a relationship without any form of intimacy. I find myself growing frustrated with any/all of her problems and the whole situation has led to a breakdown in communication. From this has stemmed a lot of emotional turmoil in my own life, including periods where I myself have felt depressed and lost. I am in love with this girl but this situation is affecting my mental health, and I feel like being with me is another added pressure to her life. \n So I guess what I'm asking is: \n1) How can I go about being more forceful in her seeing someone about her depression? I feel it could really help her become a happier person if she opened up to someone other than me about her problems.\n2) At what point do I give in and break it off? A few close friends have spoken to me and suggested that me leaving may kick start her into doing something about her depression, but I feel like I may be one of her only support systems. \n I know this essentially comes down to me, but I would love any advice/criticism oh wise and mighty reddit!	2 year relationship started off fantastically, girlfriend has developed symptoms of depression and I feel like it's destroying our relationship. She refuses to get help.	450	25	relationship_advice
I have a boyfriend, we have been together for 6 months. We meet about once every week and he has told me that he loves me.\nI told him when we began this relationship that I want to take things slow, because when we started dating it was only a month and a half after me and my ex broke up after a three year relationship. \n I felt good with my current BF but he told me shortly after we started the relationship that he had been anorexic, but was absolutely and perfectly well now. I had been battling anorexia about 8 months before we began dating so I know how it is. \n But I have noticed that he isn't over it, he eats like a little girl, constantly counts calories and it is triggering me, really bad. Around other people I don't feel like stopping eating, starving myself for perfection but around him I do. \n I have told him about this and that I feel uncomfortable naked around him, because he's so thin and fragile, meanwhile I now have some meat on my bones (130 pounds, he weight much less and is taller.) \n He thinks it is only about me being uncomfortable naked, but it is just really hard, and I can't handle with it, I want to focus on my own health, I try to help him, but I only can feel myself getting worse. \n There are also other reasons why I want to break up with him.\nI am moving out of the country in six months or so, to go to Uni and then we will break up. \n When we have sex it is only he who orgasms, and we never ever cuddle. \n He thinks this is a happy,normal relationship(his first) but I know it isn't. \n Thank you for reading this.	Well, I feel like my BF for six months is really pushing my anorexic tendancies and that makes me feel really bad, but I do not know if that is a a reason enough to break up with him.	305	39	relationship_advice
A bit of background first.  I used to be a bit of a narcissist, I used to treat women pretty badly, neglecting their needs and just focusing on how awesome I was.  I would end up manipulating their feelings and hurting them in the end.  I hated how this behavior hurt these ladies so I had a paradigm shift in my mentality and behavior.  Now I treat women very well.  I write poetry, tell them they are beautiful, I'm very giving in bed and I am there for them whenever they need me. I work out 15+ hours a week and I am in great shape.  I go to school studying neuroscience and I have jobs.   Really I'm just treating them like I would like to be treated. The only problem is that the girls have a tendency to think I'm like a puppy dog or just lose interest after awhile. \nMy question is, what is the proper decorum?  Where is the balance and should I be trying to look for a balance?  I think I just sabotaged one of the best relationships I've ever been in because of this (many other variables as well, distance plays a role.) I just don't want this to continue because I really don't want to revert back to my old self but I am often tempted because I didn't have to deal with this kind of rejection.  Any advice or help would be great appreciated.	I used to be the jerk that got what he wanted from girls, now I'm treating girls too well and they lose interest.  How do I get away from this behavior/mentality?	242	31	relationship_advice
"Where to start? I began talking to a girl online in the ends of 2013 and it wasnt anything like online dating or anything, it was just some random online contact from some site I used to use and we didnt really hit it off.. she had a bf at the time and sometime during 2014 they broke up and we began talking more often, we never got along originally but somehow we managed to click, she was/is dealing with depression and I having overcome some depression a fair few years ago we had stuff in common and it wasnt even anything ""sexual"". Around the time she broke up and we began talking more and more, until may 2015 we had been talking A LOT, I mean 15+ hours a day, phonecalls.. post letters.. we became pretty intimate in some cases with information and potential things between us, she even planned to visit me and stay for a few weeks... I was sceptical at first thinking maybe she expect me to pay (lol) but she said she'd pay the way her self and she wanted to meet me, she previously told me she loves me and she cares for me and how important I've become to her during her depressive times, and I got sucked in somehow and believed it.\nI confessed I had feelings for her somehow and she admitted she did too and that she didnt know why but we kinda had something between us.. Until around 3 weeks ago.. She forced herself outside to try to end her depression and socialise.. and within the first 24 hours met a guy, and within these past 3 weeks she's started becoming an 'item' with him.\nNow I know first off I have no complaint on this, We aint together or even met eachother (yet?). She said she wasnt looking for some sort of lovey-dovey romance thing, or any relationship thing and she said she thinks I want to make her my gf which she doesnt want.. because 'distance' and whatnot. We had a few arguments about feelings, she said if she has to choose between hurting my feelings and keeping this new guy, or choosing to see if there was anything between us that could work.. she's going to risk hurting me and see if this new guy works for her.\nShe's single and free to do what she wants, but she keeps saying how she doesnt want to lose me, and that there is still feelings there for me but the distance between us is fairly big and since we aint physically met she cant be sure. She wants me visit me during July roughly this year, but I told her if she's still with this new guy then I dont think it's fair... as much as I want to see her I dont see how this benefits me for her to visit me with this other guy back home who she's just met waiting for her when she returns.\nShe got kinda offended when I said I got 'nothing out of this' if I stick around to be her friend and shes busy with another guy since I grew to enjoy the person she became towards me, not the person she could become with a partner who she willingly chose over me, and told me she chose over me."	"Im thinking it might be necessary to cut this person out my life and safe myself the hassle, but she told me to ""wait and see"" how things go, because she ""needs this"" with mr Current Guy to get her out of her depressive cycle, and being single it shouldnt be an issue."	562	53	relationship_advice
A little backstory, my girlfriend has gone on this trip before, however sometime between the last trip and now the guy running the trip openly propositioned her for sex knowing that she is in a relationship with me. She wants to go again, I told that that I would be very unfomfortable with her going due to the one persons proposition. \n I trust her, and believe that she would never cheat on me, however the idea of her sharing a hotel room with this guy and his friends makes me very uncomfortable. She is upset with me because I feel very uncomfortable about the situation and have told her how I feel about it.

Let me start with saying that I am not afraid to ask her out I just need advice on how I should go about it. We have known each other for about a tear now. Me and her really enjoy anime (romantic comedy ones) and I think that because of that, I need to make it special when I ask her to be my girlfriend. I do not know whether I should do it soon on valentines day, or wait until the local theme park opens and ask her atop the Ferris wheel. The thing is, I am pretty sure she has similar feelings towards me as well, so I don't know if she would be disappointed if I don't ask her this valentines day.

This new twist in my life is so huge I would like to begin again because the main issue is completely different. I'd expressed frustration that my wife of 18 months didn't want to live with me, or see much of me, though we were happy with each other. \n We sat down and discussed my need for more time with her, that I love her, and I'd like to not live separately as we've been doing. \n After a while she stated that she never wanted to marry me. She only did so because I had mentioned a couple years ago I might make more money working for myself but the cost of health insurance made that tough. I have a pre-existing condition that makes the cost ridiculous. So when I proposed she said yes only because I could be on her employer's health insurance, and be free to leave my employer. \n Huh? Why would she marry me for such a dopey reason? I didn't propose based on health insurance needs, I wanted to marry her, period. I still work for the same company. No wonder she doesn't want to live together, she never wanted to be married at all. \n We had a complete wedding with family from all over the country, a band, dinner, etc. She planned most of it, and played the role of the bride with gusto. Now it seems such a fraud and I feel a knife in my back the same as if she'd cheated on me. If I'd known she never wanted to get married (nor live together) I would have broken up with her. I want to be in a happy fulfilling relationship, married or no. What I have now is an unfulfilling relationship, and a marriage I've been tricked into. Everything makes sense now, I'm in the friendzone because my wfe never wanted a husband. \n Does this seem as bad as I make it to be? Now what, do I break up with her? I'm living in a soap opera.	my wife has been distant cause she never wanted to be married, so now what? \n Edit: To add that not only does she not wanted to be married to me, she stated doesn't want to be married to ANYone. \n Edit/update: Found out she's been cheating on me for years.

"Well, for starters, I am no good at telling stories but here it goes. \n So, my girlfriend has her fair share of family problems. She talks to someone about them every now and then but it doesn't affect our relationship. Lately, she has been ranting about her half brother. He is 40 and to say he is a racist/ sexist would be a tad bit of an overstatement but he is stuck with a 50's mindset regarding race and women. This has been causing my girlfriend to go on rants about how it's white peoples fault black people are ghetto and all. This is causing her in my mind to be an extremist against racism and all and it is starting to make me feel a little weird. For example; she wants to adopt two black kids just because they sit in orphanages longer. She was saying that it will be with me or without me. She was not kidding when she said this and asked what my opinion was and I said ""as long as I have my dream fishing boat it's whatever"". She replied with something about me being selfish. I wasn't in the mood to really get into it because we were going on a long road trip in the morning. So, it has been on my mind since she mentioned it on Friday. While I don't want to bring it up again (I am hoping this is a phase) but I am not sure what to do about this. Should I speak my mind although it may break us up or should I just let it go?"

"When my boyfriend and I started dating almost a year ago there were never any accusations of me being unfaithful to him. I have honestly never cheated on him and he has very little reason to believe that I have. \n Back in February it was on of my guy friend's (20/m) birthdays and he wanted to hang out with me. We went to a grocery store to buy some cake mix and my boyfriend saw us in the car together, I waved and smiled and called him because he looked upset. He sounded fine on the phone and i said he should turn around and meet me at the grocery store and he could meet my friend. They met and my boyfriend was very smiley and lovey towards me and I thought we were fine. \n I find out a month later that I lost his trust that day. I can understand that, I was hanging out with a guy alone and he didn't know about it. I never did anything with this other guy and I haven't seen him since then except once hanging out with a group of friends. \n My boyfriend asked that if I'm going to hang out with guys that I would be with a group of people and not alone. Reasonable and fine, I would ask the same of him if roles were reversed. \n Months go by and my boyfriend starts being weird whenever I take out my phone and keeps asking if it's a guy or not. We work that out. That doesn't happen anymore. \n On Father's Day my dad came to pick me up at 11. My boyfriend thought that was ""interesting"" because his roommate had to be at his Dad's at 11 the same day, essentially accusing me of trying to cheat with his roommate. \n Today I was hanging out with my roommate (19/f) and our mutual friend (different guy 20/m) and my roommates boyfriend broke up with her. Outer guy friend and I sat in my dorm living room alone while this happened. My roommate then went to work and I went with my guy friend to get her a 'sorry your boyfriend broke up with you' present so I was in the car with him alone. \n I tell my boyfriend all that happened and he was sympathetic until I got to the part where him and I were in my dorm alone while we waited to see if she was okay. He gets quiet and distant and I asked if that was okay and he said ""not really"" and the conversation essentially ended there and he hasn't tried to talk to me since, which he normally doesn't go this long without texted me or something. \n Our one year anniversary is in a week.

"Ok so I met this girl about a year ago when my friends started flirting with her at the mall. I got her number and we started texting each other. We hung out a couple of times but after she told me she liked someone else we started to drift apart. During the months that we didn't talk I changed a lot (e.g.) huge haircut, got a job, lost 10 pounds, joined the football team and more. A couple weeks ago we started talking again. I asked her out over text and she told me that she was flattered but she had broken up with her bf about 2 weeks ago. She told me she would keep my offer in mind when she was ready to date again. She finished off by saying "" I'm just not into the whole dating thing yet"" I told her I was sorry to hear that and that she should take all the time she needs.

OK so we have been on around 5 dates or so... We have a lot of fun together and i am really liking her company. \n Problem is this... I have been in a lot of long term relationships etc..but i never have trouble with women, i date often, i don't get too involved if i don't think its gonna work... However, even with my success with women (in the sense of initiating and dating), as soon as i meet one i like, suddenly my logic and relaxation goes out the window and i overthink things. \n So anyway...\nI am a proactive kinda guy so i initiate the date talk and  set them up. She's always down for it and excited. Always tells me I'm interesting and fun. We talk through the day, and generally its always funny and light convo.. \n I have dated mostly younger girls... She is around the same age and i actually feel like we click a bit. \n So here's the question? When do we discuss what each other wants out of this? How do i bring that up? Do i discuss exclusivity? I don't want it to always just be the fun guy who she sees once a week and not actually break into that conversation. Just over a month of dating is all we have behind us.

I definitely don't suggest losing all of your various virginities all at once without a stable relationship.  OTOH, there's nothing wrong with doing lots of making out and running of bases to gradually learn the skills you've been missing out on.

"I'm (22/f) and in a relationship for one year now with my boyfriend (24/m) and I catch myself being crazy jealous over so small unimportant things and I don't even know exactly why. I've never been jealous in my entire life except for in this relationship. \n It can be a famous female actor I know he think is attractive, I can look at her during the whole movie and being angry and hope she'll turn in to a ugly witch just because I'm jealous and can't even concentrate on the movie. This is insane! I can absolutely think maleactors are attractive, so I don't get it why I'm being like this. And he's an assguy so whenever some girl has a nice ass and turns up on the screen or in real life in good looking jeans I'm boiling inside. \n But the thing that absolutely bothers me the MOST is that my boyfriend is still ""friends"" with one of his exes, they don't see each other much but talk sometimes. And I know she's one of the girls my bf have had analsex with, and he loves analsex. But I don't want to have analsex, atleast not for now. And sometimes during sex he has one finger around my asshole and lightly touches it and  it's a A BIG fucking turnoff when he does that sometimes because all I can see is he having sex with his ex. So I could never even if I maybe wanted to try anal, because I would see his ex in my head and barf. \n He had alot of exes and I havn't been in a relationship before, so I think it feels like he loved more women and I don't like that since I want to be the one and only, I know I am now so it's totally ridiculous! He often tells me how he never loved someone so much as he loves me, and thought he had been in love, but now realise he hasn't, and that what he's feeling with me is real pure love. And that he truly thinks I'm the most beautiful and hottest person he's ever seen. So I don't know why I'm so frustrated when he's talking about one of hes exes or talking about someone looking good. \n DOES ANYBODY RECOGNIZE THEMSELFS? OR AM I A CRAZY INSANE CHICK?

My GF and I have known one another for 2 years and have dated, this round for 7 months. I say this round because we have during the past 2 years dated twice before, once for a few months, took a break came back dated a few more months, and then broke up again, always at the issue of her dating a someone 7.5 years younger. Age has never been an issue for me as I have always found myself to be more mature than my peers. \n She and I get along like we've known one another forever. We enjoy each others company, however, I know that she is trying to settle into her life. She has ambitions to travel, to buy a house this year and has mentioned marriage and starting a family all of which she wants to share with her partner, which at this moment is me. \n However, with those dreams I am having problems keeping up due to my age. The issue is that she makes 3x my salary. She is 7.5 years ahead in her career. She is a nurse , I am an architectural designer. I can not afford to keep up with some of those dreams as much as I would like to. I can only uphold one of the pillars of the relationship, being emotionally available, to which I think I do an amazing job.  I hold a steady job, pay all my bills and am generally on an upwards path. But I am at the beginning of my career, and not in the middle of it. \n She has recently begun to question me about my finances, in evaluating me for her future. My only response has been that I am where I am right now. That I can not close 'the gap' (which she has named the physical and financial separation we share) is the biggest issue to our relationship. We had a fight this weekend about where I am financially and I am understanding that she is on the verge of making decisions that effect our future, however she is doing so alone, without my input. I have tried asking her if she sees me in any part of her future. I want to be there in every way I can yet I dont have the means to give her comfort other then asking her to trust that I will do whatever It takes to make sure that she is always taken care of. \n I guess I am here wondering what I can do in this situation? We both love one another. Do I sit by and let her come to the conclusion that dating me is not financially sound? I come from the belief that love should triumph all and that you find a way to make things work if you truly love someone. Maybe i'm wrong?

"I second AMerrickanGirl's opinion. \n Breaks do not work, plain and simple. \n There is a root problem here. Whether it is lack of excitement, sea above, or something else. It may just be the way you act towards each other. The simple fact is, just because you love someone doesn't mean they love you. Personally, I have never believed in ""trying to make it work."" It puts more stress on an already stressed relationship. Things like this should come naturally. \n That being said, relationships are not easy things. There always will be problems to work out, compromises to be made. Taking a break solves none of these things. Since you already agreed to the break, do not violate that contract. See it through, but use the time to think on your relationship. Do you really want it? What are the problems? The first time you are together again should include a conversation about what the break meant to you and what you thought about and learned. I know it sounds sappy/stupid."

The thing I've learned about being in a relationship is that it can only happen if you're happy with yourself. In a way, you have to love yourself before you can be loved. My suggestion to you: focus on becoming content with who you are. \n I felt the same way you did back when I was in high school. I felt like I had accomplished a lot but at the same time I felt conflicted because my friends were in relationships and I had never even met anyone who I could even remotely see myself in a relationship with. It bothered me for a long time, but eventually I stopped dwelling on what I was missing and started focusing more on what I was good at, what I wanted to do, and what made me happy. As soon as I stopped thinking about how I felt like I deserved love or deserved a relationship, I found a great girl. The weird lesson that I learned though throughout my entire development of my relationship was that the harder I tried to be loved, the less it happened. \n The thing about being loved and being in love is that it comes from being yourself. It's not something you can create at will, and it's not something you can make another person do. Before you can be loved, you need to love yourself. To love yourself, you just have to go out and do what makes you happy. Become great at something, go on adventures, develop your hobbies, try to involve yourself in things that make you feel accomplished. For me, that meant getting fit. For you, it may mean accomplishing even more things. It's different for everyone. \n Last of all, learn to manage your expectations. Instead of feeling like you need to do something in order to be loved, do things because you want to do them. Real love is based around an attraction to who you are as a person, not what you do. Know that it won't come easy, and it isn't guaranteed, and that there may be long times where you will not have it. But that doesn't mean you will never get it, that you aren't loveable, or that you aren't doing enough. It just means you have not met the person who appreciates you for you. Genuine appreciation is hard to come by, but it makes the world of a difference. Appreciate people, and they will appreciate you. Eventually, maybe that appreciation will turn to something more.	You don't have to do something to be loved, you just have to be yourself and the rest will come on it's own when the time and person is right.	420	30	relationship_advice
My SO and I broke up about 3 weeks ago, because I wasn't ready (we had been dating for 14 months) most of which was a LDR.

We've been having talks more recently about the future; where we'd move after he graduated, looking at places to stay, jobs etc. \n After a really nice romantic dinner one night we were just laying in bed and I looked him in the eye and whispered ""I love you"" because it just seemed like the right time. To this he replied that he'd never been in love, that he appreciates it and would let me know when he does. He was very gentle about the whole thing and made sure I was ok about the whole exchange. \n Since this we've carried on as per usual, but something in the back of my paranoid mind won't let this go. Am I fretting too much over a few words? I just can't fight the notion that I'm investing too heavily into this relationship compared to him. What should I do in this situation? Bring the subject up again at a later date? Drop it altogether and just go with it? Pull back a bit and see what happens? \n I'd appreciate any and all advice. Hopefully I can settle this and move on, as it's probably just me overthinking things. Thanks all!"	Told him I loved him, was not reciprocal; plan from here?	238	11	relationship_advice
So a few months ago I met this girl while on an internship and we hit it off immediately.  Same interests, same sense of humor, and she even thought I was good looking.  I'm 22 years old and I've never even been on a date before, I'm always awkward and nervous around women and I tend to over think things which has always stopped me from ever making a move.  I decided this time would be different; I manned up and asked her out and within a week of first talking we were on our first date. \n It was fantastic, she was also a novice at the dating scene and so we were both learning as we went.  By the time Christmas came along I thought I couldn't ever be happier, we talked all day at work, would go out on most weekends, and were both telling all our friends that we had finally met someone.  I was excited and nervous but everything seemed to be going right. \n After new years I headed back to university for my final four month term.  We were both a bit anxious about this but were sure we could get through it.  We were both looking up ideas for Skype dating etc. and would be trying to meet up on weekends if possible. \n Last week however, she had an interview with a company in another county (leaving out details in case anyone sees this), and was pretty sure she nailed it, and sure enough just a few days ago she got the job offer.  We had a long and sad talk where she told me she would be taking the job and that the best thing would be to end our relationship, as long distance would just be too hard (neither of us have much money to travel, student loans etc.).  I told her I would be willing to try long distance, but that if she didn't want to I would respect her wishes. \n So that's it, she\u2019s going to be moving soon and I don't even know if I'll get a chance to see her in person again.  I'm a complete wreck, I've gone from the happiest I've ever been to feeling like complete crap in under three weeks.  It\u2019s not like we were having problems or anything like that, it was going so well and now...it\u2019s just...over.  I can't concentrate, I think about her all the time, I don't feel like doing anything.  She says she feels the same way but I know she's got her new job and moving to distract her. \n I don't know how to deal with this.  I've never felt this sad in my life, I was so ready to finally be in a relationship with someone and I poured my heart into it, and now it\u2019s just gone...a victim to circumstance.  We try talking sometimes, but it\u2019s completely different and awkward now.  I don\u2019t even know if we\u2019ll be able to maintain a friendship and that makes me feel even worse.  I'm not mad or angry, I understand her decision and I know it\u2019s hurting her too.  I don't want to try and forget because there was nothing bad about the time we had together, we both thought it was going to last much longer than this. \n I\u2019m normally a pretty happy guy, I play video games and go to the gym, I have school and friends I hang out with and I know I\u2019ll feel better in time.  But what do I do right now\u2026until that time comes?  I feel so empty and sick to my stomach; I don\u2019t know if I want to go back in time or forwards\u2026I just don\u2019t want to be here.	first relationship was going amazing.  Now she's moving to another country and thinks it would be too hard to go long distance.  I accept that its over but I feel like crap, like what we had was cut down just as it was really taking off...don't know how to deal \n Any advice would be really appreciated.	620	56	relationship_advice
Okay, so me and my boyfriend have been dating for almost two years and for a long time, I was confident we were going to be together for well, ever. But lately, he has been a lot about sex and less about me and well frankly that's kind of pissing me off.

He if full aware of both of those things and yet still pushes for making out and this and that and well, I dont want that right now. I got diagnosed with many mental disorders as well over this year and so yah maybe I have been acting differently but is that my fault?

"Today I (28yo female) read a g-chat exchange between my boyfriend (30yo male; heterosexual) and a female friend of his (28yo female; bisexual). My boyfriend was telling this friend how horny he was and how excited he was to go home and jerk off. Parallel to this conversation (and I didn't know at the time they were g-chatting) I had also been g-chatting with him, and told him I would be home early that day, as it was my last day at my current job.

So, I've been dating my girlfriend for 8 months today (yay!), but for the longest time, especially this summer (we're long distance by about 3 hours and I see her most often at school), I've been having some insecurity issues that have been affecting my behavior. It's a combination of me not having a heap of self-confidence, as well as I've been burned before in relationships, and I want to avoid it. What I didn't realize until last night was that, in my efforts to keep our relationship, I was actually destroying it. My girlfriend has finally gotten tired of my insecure behavior, and while she doesn't want to break up yet, she let me know that she is losing faith with the relationship. I really want to salvage this while I still can, because I love her deeply and I am prepare to fight for this relationship. I ask you, Reddit, what are your suggestions for feeling less, if not at all, insecure when it comes to a significant other? And, how might you salvage this?

So what do you do when you've been with a girl for a year.  You love her, and she is in your eyes the coolest, most bad ass girl you've ever been with.  You're happy and think everything is great.  All of a sudden she becomes depressed, isolated, and when you ask her whats wrong she tells you that she is miserable half the time. \n I recently lost my job (a month ago) out of my own fault of leaving for vacation for a month.  I've come back and I can't pay for anything (we don't live together).  I have no kids, no ex-wife, I've made my life free and simple for 30 years.  She is a bit younger than me and has an ex-husband and 2 kids.  I go snowboarding, and I enjoy being at the bar, its what I do.  All of a sudden she doesn't want to go the bar, she says all I do is party and put her on the back burner. She was fine with our life style for a year. Now she acts like she is over it.  She sent me an e-mail about how all I do is fuck her.  This isn't true. She is welcome to hang out with me at the bar, we go snowboarding together, I tell her all the time we can just chill and watch a movie, but apparently this has become not good enough.  I can see her stress in me not having a job, and she has her own responsibilities, but she gave me this ultimatum.  If you want me to be your fuck buddy then let me know, or if you want to hang out when you aren't snowboarding or hanging out at the bar let me know and we can hang out.  Now she knows I don't have a job and there isn't going to be much else we can do. I snowboard and can drink for free mind you.  How do I respond to this e-mail.  I care for this girl but I was with a girl previously that literally went nuts. She began pulling all her hair out and her parents had to send her away.  I feel like she is starting to go crazy too.

"Hi everyone \n I've been with my girlfriend since I was 19 (I am 22 now). \n She is lovely and everything, and I feel horrible just having these thoughts, as I have been for a while. \n She is my first serious relationship. I am aware that the ""honeymoon"" phase fades away. And in fact it did, about over a year ago. \n I had a couple difficult months back then where I considered breaking up, and almost did but figured it was stupid as it's only normal that after a while things settle down, and the spark fades. \n The thing is that that feeling stayed in me in a subtle way, and even though everything has been good between us, it has been crawling back stronger and stronger every day, being present almost daily for a year, if not more. \n I feel terrible because I feel like I am in a lose lose situation. And like she is in an even worse way, since its out of her control. \n Firstly, she is is wonderful. She loves me to bits (and tells me every single day) and is extremely caring, understanding (I have a few issues with my psyche I will not bore you with) and overall (almost) flawless. She hasn't done anything wrong to me. \n Yet, I feel like I want to be alone. It's not like something major has happened, like cheating, or falling in love with someone else. I just want to be alone. It might sound stupid, but I feel like it's right for me. I feel like the relationship has ran its course, as stupid as it may sound. \n I know that the grass is always greener on the other side, but I can't help feeling this way. I feel like every day that passes I am lying to myself, and to her. And I don't know if this is temporary or if it will ever go. \n She has no idea this is going on, and I hate myself for it. I would not want to be in her shoes. And I can't bring myself to be honest with her. \n I don't even know where to start. What the hell am I gonna say? ""I know we spent 3 great years together and you love me more than anything, but I am breaking up with you for no reason even though yesterday we had a lovely dinner?"" \n The reason why I haven't been able to even approach the subject is because I can't bear the thought of seeing how I'd break her heart. She is a sweet and innocent girl, and doesn't deserve such a shock.

"Long story... I(m33), my first relationship I was together with her total 15 years and married 5 of those.  She cheated at the end multiple times and thanks to this subreddit I learned to finally ditch the bitch and divorce.  2 years of nothing then finally a rebound with an awesome girl that ended amicably.  Right before I met her I moved back to my hometown and decided to step my game up and try to make new friends with peeps outside my friend group since grade school.  Met this girl we'll call Haley,  hit it off right off the bat, same interests in everything it was scary.  We were both in relationships at the time so no flirting or anything or hanging out alone, just one of those friends that you can just be yourself around and always smiling.  Fast forward a bit we are both single for awhile, a few nights of drinking together she hops in my lap and we have the best make out session ever in my life, we cuddle for a bit talking about the tension that's been there since the start (I'm a retarded guy and had no clue), but I'm in heaven.  We start hanging out more but nothing goes past making out and cuddling.  Now let's make it clear I'm no looker and slightly chubby and this girl is absolutely beautiful and her ex is 6 figures and looks like the Rock in comparison.  After a few weeks and she's bringing over chocolate strawberries and wine and my favorite beer talking about spending time in the jacuzzi with me, I get over flustered. I go alpha and make smooth moves but it gets declined even though I can tell she wants it.  A few days later I call her out that I can't do that anymore, not that I'm just fine with making out and cuddling, but she keeps saying and acting like the real deal is going down and it's driving me crazy.  She is sad yet doesn't explain herself and we go back to friends.  So a few weeks later she brings over a girlfriend of hers(bff's since college) and next thing I know I have 2, 8/10's in my jacuzzi, naked.  The other girl is giving me ""the eyes"" and I do what my nerdy, chubby and dorky self has always dreamed of doing, and I just grab her and pull her to me and we make out in the pool with Haley busy on her phone.  Turns out she gets mad and goes home and I end up dating this girl for a year before we break up while Haley dates her on/off boyfriend.  Now me and Haley are single again, we both had time off for Xmas and go on a vacation together.

"Your problem is very simple.  You're afraid to put yourself out there.  I know this because I have felt the same way.   Part of it is lack of self confidence, part of it is fear of rejection, part of it is the chance that someone you may know will see you doing posting your picture online etc.\nIf you are uncomfortable with putting yourself out there online, you may want to think about doing things off line to meet people.  The best venue for finding someone is sometimes a place where meeting people is not a primary goal.   I recommend getting involved in clubs or activities, volunteering, and generally doing things that may be of interest to you. \nIt's hard to take the leap alone, but in general most clubs, groups, volunteer agencies are very welcoming to new people.  It's an opportunity to do something worthwhile and meet people of the opposite sex in a casual environment.  Other ways to ""put yourself out there"" is to spend some time at coffee houses and book stores.  Bring your laptop if you have one and smile at guys that capture your attention.  If I saw an attractive girl smile at me at a coffee house, especially if she were sitting alone, I'd say hi and at least make small talk."	this	218	1	relationship_advice
We have been dating for 5 years and he has always been wonderful. I went onto reddit on his computer like I always do and noticed a different username.

Hello Reddit. Me and my girlfriend have been together for about 8 years and have known for a while now that we plan on getting married and starting a family. While I feel excited to be nearing a proposal and getting ready to plan a wedding, a new issue has arisen regarding an engagement ring. \n I have been looking for an engagement ring for a little over a year now. We have discussed what she likes in terms of a ring, and I know her tastes very well, so I have an idea of what the ring will be. I was looking mainly at vintage rings, with a sapphire center stone due to both cost and preference. Due to financial issues (both in College, both \u2018student poor\u2019), I have been looking at rings well under the amount that I had originally thought I would spend and I struggle to imagine how I would afford those. Luckily, for both of us, an expensive engagement ring (and wedding for that matter) is not important. \n Around 2010 \u2013 2012, my father was dating a woman and decided to propose. He purchased a very nice engagement ring and they were engaged for about 6 months before calling off the wedding. She returned the engagement ring and he has kept it since. \n Last night, I was discussing with my father finding an engagement ring for my girlfriend. My father brought out the ring and it is very much in the style I was looking for my girlfriend, just  much much  nicer than I could ever think to imagine purchasing myself. The price of this ring is approx. 4x more than I could imaging spending, and again, I\u2019m not in a place at all to purchase even a very affordable ring right now. The main difference being that this ring has a large center diamond (more traditional engagement ring style), and sapphires on the side. \n My father is an extremely generous man. I told him this is the style I was imagining for my girlfriend just much nicer, and he offered the ring to me, no strings attached. He very much likes my girlfriend, and is said he would be happy to see the ring be used in the family. \n Now, when my father\u2019s engagement happened, my girlfriend and I, along with my siblings, knew my father had spent a lot on a ring. We also know that he got the ring back, and has yet to sell the ring. My father knows that it would be awkward to let my girlfriend know that this is the ring, and asked me not to mention this to her. \n I don\u2019t know whether or not I should accept this ring. I told my father that I would, but I am now having doubts. These are my concerns: 1) desperately want to discuss this with my girlfriend, as we are best friends and share everything, but a) have been asked not to by my father, b) do not want to ruin a surprise proposal. 2) I am very concerned that if she finds out she will be disappointed. To me, this is a positive thing, but absolutely can see what she and others may not find this the same. 3) The ring is clearly much nicer than what I could afford and will raise suspicions. This may lead down a path of lie or confess. \n I wanted to get this community's take on my (albeit positive) predicament.	Should I accept an engagement ring from my father, who used the ring to propose, but whose relationship subsequently dissolved? I\u2019m worried my girlfriend may have a very legitimate issue with this. \n EDIT: I've decided to look into resetting the ring and the costs around that. Thanks for the advice everyone!	578	51	relationship_advice
Recently I started going to college and there's a girl doing the same course as me that I've taken a liking to. We're in the same class for 2 subjects but its hard to just go up and talk to her as most of the time she's with 2 of her friends and in the big lecture halls we're in (200+) it's hard to get a seat next to her. And I'm shy and would be really nervous just walking up and talking to her. I think she likes me as well as I've caught her looking at me a few times but I could be jumping to conclusions. \n A big positive is we live in the same student accomodation complex and the door to her apartment is about 30 feet away from the door to mine.

I\u2019ll provide you with some background information. \n I\u2019ve know this girl (we\u2019ll call her \u201cK\u201d) since freshman year in college. We met in chemistry class. K and I have always been rather friendly to each other. We never were overly flirtatious, but there was some. She would always find some opportunity to hand out. The problem is we never really did. Looking back I\u2019m wondering why I didn\u2019t try to make a move. There were times then when I wondered why she was being so kind, so over the top \u201ctouchy feely.\u201d \n The problem is I\u2019ve never had the cojones to approach women. Even to this day I\u2019m still a little apprehensive. High school was terrible. I was rejected by a couple girls then and basically turned a blind eye to the female kind. I surrounded myself with good friends, learned a lot and worked my ass off to pay for school. I\u2019ve since regained some of my courage. \n Fast forward to this past academic year. I had a class in the biology building of the university. One day while getting coffee K comes out of nowhere and says hello. We chit chat for a bit. I ask her what she\u2019s doing later that week and ask her for out for a drink and a bite to eat. She was thrilled! She hugged me and said she had to get to her class since she was late. \n Now, when that happened I wasn\u2019t exactly looking for anything. By this time this girl had dropped off my radar and out of my mind. Yet, out of the blue (about 2 years of no contact) she approached me. Unfortunately though, dinner never happened as this was one month before the end of school. We were both extremely busy and promised to have dinner after school ended. \n After graduation we never had those drinks. We both have very different work schedules. She works weird hours at the hospital. I\u2019m always running between clients in Hartford, Boston, and New York. We\u2019ve tried inviting each other for drinks/dinner/movie/hang out/etc but some things just don\u2019t work out. Last Friday I get a text message asking me to a bar for drinks while I was in NY. I say I can\u2019t but we should meet up another time. We arrange for drinks this Friday to celebrate me leaving my current job and going to the next. I propose a couple places in a town close by. Being my first time going out with her (and any other girl for that matter) I was a bit anxious. \n Yesterday I received a text message saying that K wants to go bar hopping. I say that\u2019s cool and all. I then get a text saying that a mutual (guy) friend of ours E is coming. This is what\u2019s bothering me. I\u2019m not sure what I should make of it. I\u2019ve been running every conversation K and I have had leading up to and after I asked her out through my head. I question if I wasn\u2019t as direct as I should have. To add to my anxiety and pressure I\u2019ve never been in a relationship before (super confident on the outside, SAP2 on the inside). I\u2019m afraid of screwing up. On top of that, E has let slip that he\u2019s into K. Am I just overreacting about this whole event? What is reddits advice?	Guy misses prime opportunity to go out with girl early on in college.

"I moved a month ago for seasonal work and got in on a house rental through Craigslist with a couple my age. They're both really low key and easy going and it is going surprisingly well for strangers on the Internet. \n Within a few days of my arrival, the girl's college/post college roommate came down to visit for 3 nights. (She lives about 2 hours away). No big deal, it was Memorial Day weekend. She was nice enough and a respectful houseguest on all fronts. \n Nine days after she leaves, she came back again. This was two weeks ago tonight. She's still here. \n She buys her own food, is sleeping on one of the couches, and is non obtrusive around the house with the exception of making it difficult for me to get to know my housemate, because they are glued at the hip. She has no car and relies on my housemate to get around. She stays in the house messing around on her phone when they're not together. I dont know many people here yet so I've invited her to do things a few times when my housemate has been at work and I've been off, but she's declined and I've stopped asking. (For example, invited her for coffee, she said ""I'm so full from breakfast still"". Hint: IT'S NOT ABOUT THE COFFEE.) \n I'm paying $800 a month to rent my room. She's...not paying anything. She still has her apartment that I know she has to return to at some point, but I've heard no mention of when. I feel very uncomfortable asking what's up, because I can't get my roommate alone and don't know how to tactfully ask how long she's going to continue to stay for. I also plan on having multiple guests over during the season but for 2-3 nights at a time and not too frequently. I wasn't consulted about her visit, but I wouldn't have said no anyway, it would have just been nice to know. \n So my questions: \n \n Am I justified in feeling irritated? \n \n How can I phrase my wtf is she still doing here? question without sounding like an uptight, petty ass? \n \n Any tips on handling potential future guest gray area situations without sounding like a Mitbew\xf6hnernazi? \n \n \n Thank you!"

"Ok so I had a thing with this girl named A and liked her enough to ask her out after she'd asked me to her prom. She has very strict parents and replied with ""Yes, but my parents don't want me to date until 18"" so I said well we don't have to tell them, just think about it. 2 weeks goes past and I've heard nothing, and I don't know where I stand or what to do. At the prom I ask her if she's thought any harder and she looks surprised, then hesitates for about 20 seconds before reluctantly saying yes. Now I really don't know what to do, as her body language and everything is saying no. We aren't even hugging let alone kissing. \n We get to the prom and I'm sitting between her and her best friend named B, who has taken a family friend to prom. I end up chatting non-stop to her best friend and we get on 10 times better than I ever did with A \u2013 flirting, teasing each other, laughing, hugging \u2013 all things I never really did with A. But I keep telling myself to stop thinking about how great she is because I'm here with A. \n Then comes the afterparty, and A isn't drinking so she goes off somewhere. I end up spending the whole time with B, laughing and carrying on, and she's made it crystal clear through how she's acting that she really likes me. I start thinking to myself that I'm done with being stuck in this grey area with A, who I barely even like anymore, and that if she wants to act like we aren't dating then she shouldn't expect me to act any differently. \n So I decide to go for it and kiss B. She kisses back, hard. We end up making out down the back for about an hour, giggling and playing with each other's hair, and I had butterflies in my stomach the entire time. I've never felt that with A or anyone else, and one of her friends told me I was the 2nd guy she'd ever kissed, so I would hope that means it meant something to her as well. \n That was a few days ago. A found out on the night and hates me... and I haven't spoken to B yet. I'm sure their friendship is suffering, which makes me feel absolutely terrible. I'm not a bad guy, I never thought I would cheat on anyone (even though I don't think this really is). I don't really like A anymore so I don't really want to recover anything with her, but I still really really like B and I haven't stopped thinking about the kiss with her. Is it wrong to pursue her, given the circumstances? Should I just cut my losses and move on? How can I help their friendship recover? I know I should leave it for A's sake but I don't know if I can given how I'm feeling right now. Was I right to kiss her in the first place? Where do I go from here?

I confronted her and she admitted everything. \n We'd dated for 3 years, had been engaged for 3 and were getting married next year.  Last month, while developing our ""life plan"" we agreed we wanted to be debt free prior to the wedding.

"So, recently a new girl joined our school. When I saw her, I instantly wanted to be friends with her but didn't know how to approach her at first. \n Luckily for me, the person who was assigned to make sure she gets to her classes was someone who also goes to the same science room at lunch (better than outside or library so we go there) as me and my friends. So, Beth (the new girl) came too. \n Then, today, she didn't come to the science room because the person who was supposed to go to her classroom to wait couldn't because of teachers. So, when she didn't come I said I'll go look for her. I found her sitting alone outside reading a book (she does this in breaks when we go outside too). I came up to her and asked if she wanted to go to the science room, she said yes (she's very quiet, she looked at me for about 5 seconds before answering and I felt bad for a while because I thought maybe she preferred to stay outside but felt obliged to say yes). On the way back to the room, I asked her if she had facebook, ""yes"", and asked for her last name. I have now added her on facebook. \n I planned to message her when she accepted (she accepted 10 minutes ago) but I'm scared. I don't know what to say, will she even like me?

"Ok this will be long but I need an answer because I'm lost. \n I met this girl (Lady) last year when her boyfriend (Guy) and her moved in to town. Honestly the first time I saw her I thought I was in love, she was beautiful and extremely friendly.

Hey ladies! I hope this is the right place to post this, if not let me know which sub would be better. I'll try to keep it short. \n I have been dating my boyfriend [22M] for almost three years. I love him dearly, but lately we've been really struggling with communication. There are some serious things we need to discuss (mostly religion, but some other things like our future together), but everytime I bring it up, he shuts down and doesn't want to talk about it. This has been going on for a few months now and I don't know what to do, I've tried everything - giving him time and being patient, bringing it up and asking him to think about it and discuss it later, bringing it up casually in conversation, forcing him to talk to me... Literally nothing works. \n We haven't always had this problem, but it seems like now that things are getting serious he is panicking and stressing hard. There's a lot going on in his life and he doesn't handle stress well. But I really need to know where we stand. The biggest thing is that he comes from a STRICT catholic background and I come from a Christian background, I feel like it's not a huge deal and we can work around it but I just need him to TELL me what he thinks about it, or if its a deal breaker for marriage or kids. I've brought up numerous potential solutions but he just always shuts them down and goes quiet. I have no idea what he's thinking or what's going on in his head. Now I can't even talk to him about getting married or what his thoughts are, he just gets defensive and says he doesn't have it all planned out. He thinks I'm demanding an exact answer but all I really want is to have a discussion. \n I'm just so frustrated and confused. I'm not willing to just break up with him and give up but at the same time I can't get married to someone who won't talk to me. Yesterday I finally just snapped and said I needed time. I don't know where to go from here. He says he wants to get married and he acts like nothing is wrong but I feel like I'm being ripped to shreds from the inside out, I'm so lost.

I could really use some advice on what to do with this girl I like who's a really good friend\n Short Version \n So for about 2 months I've been talking with this girl I met via Online lets call her Cait. In that time we really hit it off, we'd text all through out the day and video chat nightly almost everyday and tell each other eveything. We haven't met in person yet because of work and school but are planning on it for the summer (we only live about 2 hours away from each other). From the beginning I felt some type of connection to Cait and after a month knew I really liked this girl. I don't normally let myself like other girls easily in fear of getting my heart ripped out and fed to me, but with her I couldn't help how I felt. \n About 2 weeks ago I told her how I felt for her and she told me she was confused because she doesn't know if she likes me or loves me as a best friend and she started hanging out with this other guy and Its hard because we both make her happy. I told her that if shes really happy with this guy she should be with him (stupid freaking thing to say yeah I know). She said I just love you and doesn't want things to change between us. I told her that she wont lose me because I don't want to lose her and if shes happy with him then I'm happy for her.

I only begin to feel attracted to them after I know them for a few months and become close friends with them. \n This has been pretty problematic for me dating-wise, because it's pretty awkward to ask one of your closest friends out.

Hello reader, first of all I'd like to thank you for reading this. \n Now, this is somewhat of a longer story than this but here it is \n I get along great with a woman (we have a lot of chemistry), we've known each other for around 5 months or so and we're really close, we talk almost every day (we're far apart for now). We've slept together holding hands, cuddling and all (but we hadn't had sex). We began to get closer around a month ago or so but we haven't been together all that much because I'm away. \n So, the first weekend together was a blast, we were really close and we had a lot of fun but the next one, 2 weeks later we got too drunk and almost had sex (I say almost because we were way too drunk to actually do it, as embarrassing as it sounds). During that she confessed that she was falling for me, and I confessed the same. \n Next day she broke broke it off (to be fair nothing had officially started, but you get the idea), she said she was bad for me because I still had a lot to live and that she appreciated me too much and respected me too much, that I was a really good guy and she didn't want to shackle me because she had already been through a lot. \n I was shocked and couldn't say anything, I tried to accept her choice but after a week we ended up talking on the phone about it because I needed to tell her how I felt, that I liked as she is, with her virtues, flaws and scars . I asked her for a chance to start going out as more than just friends but she said no. \n I told her I would treat her the same way I'd always treated her (as a very good and close friend). We still talk every day and we still have a lot of plans (we've been thinking of traveling together, going to the opera, ballet, etc.). I'm going to see her next weekend and we've a lot of stuff planned: lunch with her, then movies, then pot cookies (we've never tried pot so we're curious), and some other stuff. \n I'm confused as to what to do. I've been thinking to just let whatever happens happen since it feels like I'm in limbo and I don't know if my feelings or her feelings might come out again. One thing's on the phone but in person it's a whole different story. \n Do any of you have any advice? Should I just go with the flow? Have any of you been in a similar situation before? \n Thanks a lot for the help, I'm very inexperienced when it comes to relationships.

K here are the basic facts. I'm a 27 year old guy with limited dating/sex experience. I've had 3 partners--4 counting this girl we'll call Veronica, who I've been out with several times now, including 3 sexual encounters. We've done everything up to PIV sex. It's Veronica's first time for everything. (Religious upbringing+overweight until recently+anxiety, etc.) She and I haven't clearly agreed to date exclusively yet, (I told her I'm not seeing anyone else, but talking to a couple people, which is true) but it's pretty clear she wants to be exclusive. \n We've tried to have sex twice but it hasn't worked out because I've been having troubles staying stiff enough to get in there. I think this is at least partly because I'm feeling guilty about the fact that I don't really see this relationship going anywhere. There are a bunch of things I really like about us as a potential couple: we have complementary strengths, our sex drives seem in tune, and I really admire her personality and intelligence. But...I don't feel a strong emotional bond to her. \n I've had wonderful relationships (platonic and romantic) with women with whom I just clicked--where we could talk about anything for hours in the most natural way. It's just not like that with Veronica. We've shared some intimate confessions, some laughs, and we've both made some pretty leading statements while in the throes of passion. (Crazy about you etc.) But at the end of the day...I don't see a love connection happening for me. \n So anyway, we're planning to get together again (and trying for sex again) in the next couple of days. I'm starting to feel pretty guilty about the prospect of being her first for everything, when it's a big deal to her, and when I'm pretty sure that I'll want out of this as soon as I find someone I like better. \n So my question is, do I tell her I'm not feeling a romantic future between us? A friend who I consider very wise in these matters told me that I only owe Veronica honesty about what  my  feelings and desires are, and that I should let Veronica be the guardian of her own feelings. \n I don't know what to think or what to say or how to say it. It's almost 5am my time, and I haven't slept yet because I keep thinking about this. Really appreciate any feedback.	Dating a girl with no experience--she wants me to be her first everything, but she also seems to think this is the budding romance of the decade...and for me, well, I'm pretty sure it isn't.

I've been dating my girlfriend for more than last 6 months now. I love her, things were going great and we've been also thinking about our future together.\nDuring the first 2 months we decided to go exclusive which at first felt very fast for me but i was excited about it and I committed to that. I also deleted all my dating apps and stopped dating anyone else, but in a month after that, i still had a number of this girl and for some reason i decided to go on a date with her. I didn't sleep with or kissed her, I know that doesn't make right though. Fast forward yesterday she found out that i did go on a date with some girl as she stumbled on one my past texts.\nI know I completely screwed up and now she finds to hard to trust me (rightly so) and this might end our relationship now. I know how it feels since i've been on the other end multiple times. I never thought I would be the one who would cheat. At the time I somehow rationalized that i am not sleeping with anyone else, but I know that doesnt make it right. I really did commit to her in mind at some point, and never meant to cheat on her. I know i can't go back and fix this, but how do I do make it work? I desperately want to be with her and genuinely see my future with her. Please advice.	I screwed up my relationship by going on a date with someone else while we were exclusive in first 3months of the relationship. I really love her and want to be with her.

I (M25) worked with her (F29), we're quite friendly for co-workers and I think she likes me. After I leave I ask her out but she said 'no'. We've carried on being our normal level of friendly when we see each other (group of us who do/did work together get together every few weeks), after a little bit of initial awkward. \n I kind of have this assumption that I can't be trying to be any more friendly with her because she will think I have ulterior motives. TBH there's a bit of me that does want her to get to know me better in case she changes her mind but I know I have to respect her choice so I can and will keep that in check. Do you think she is likely to think this or would she just have moved on from it all? \n Every now and again someone brings up dating and suddenly it's a bit awkward again because she's obviously trying not to look at me. Is that kind of to be expected or should I read something into that? I generally don't feel awkward now but maybe she always will? \n Should I let myself have that little bit of hope she might change her mind? Is that a thing that people do or am I just trying to convince myself? I don't want to be disrespectful so she'd need to give me good reason to think it's even ok to flirt. I did an awful job of asking her and her feeling weird about the recent work relationship might have had something to do with it. I sat there the other day as her friends told her she should date more then just after mentioning to her how I'm a 'good one'. If I let myself have that bit hope then these sort of thing get in my head and have me thinking about how much I like her which isn't helpful. But this is more than an average crush for me, I don't want to give up if there's a chance. \n And any other thoughts on navigating this are welcome. It's a new one to me. I don't want to be a dick and if we're not going to date then I do want to be friends.	I asked her out, she said no and now I'm not sure how friendly to be, if she still feels awkward and if there's a point maintaining hope.	383	28	askwomenadvice
She is 21 and i am 26. This is a guy (about my age) from her workplace. He started complimenting her for being good at the job, then suddenly added her on instagram (searched her up) and had her number from work so he started to text her and very quickly opened up and talked about deep things and issues he has in his life. My GF of 4 years, the amazing girl that she is, of course wants to help him. She starts talking to him a lot, which honestly I don't mind too much. \n Recently I found out they still talk every day, at any time of the day. Morning, afternoon, evening, night. He texts her and she replies. They even meet eachother for walks sometimes and this week they met at a bar once and grabbed dinner once. She tried to reassure me very kindly that nothing is going on and that it's me she loves and that I should not worry. But I do. Honestly I trust her but I don't know what to think of the situation. \n I talked to her again about me feeling uncomfortable about them talking so much and hanging out like that and she starts acting like I'm suffocating her. Am I? \n Is it unreasonable? Maybe it is. \n How do you handle situations like this? You tell them, you lose, you don't tell them, you lose. Is there just no winning? \n This guy has complimented her looks, her personality and god knows what else...

"The backstory here is that I've known this friend since we were kids/teenagers. We used to hang out a ton, and she was good friends with my younger sister. While we grew apart a little bit as we aged (I went to college, she went to college, etc.), we never had a falling out or anything. She also started dating a guy when she was 14 and dated him for a few years off-and-on. \n Now, recently, we're both back home (ish) and she is single. I think the world of this girl. I think she's one of the most amazing people I know and she's fucking beautiful along with it. We've communicated much, much more than we had in the preceding years recently. I'm considering taking the plunge, and telling her pretty directly that while it's outside the dynamic of our existing relationship, I'd like to pursue her more as a romantic interest. I've only given how I would say it a little thought, but something to the effect of ""I know it might be out there or unexpected, but I'd like to spend more time with you and see where it goes. You're great [for all these reasons] and I want to take you on dates and enjoy your company even though I realize this isn't necessarily the way you might currently think of me"" or something like that. \n Because she's as great as she is, I expect she'll be honest with me and not shitty about it. If she's not into it, I won't push the issue. If she wants time to think, I'll give her it. It's more about me making sure I'm not missing out on what could be because I'm afraid to ask. Still, the potential exists that it gets awkward and she is less comfortable around me and our friendship changes. \n Am I crazy because I want to do this? Does my text look too direct? Ultimately, it will be decided by her thoughts on me so I'm thinking that what I saw probably isn't as important as just saying it, but I'm so in my own head on this one, it's fucked."

I'm 18, turning 19 in a few months and I just finished my first year of university. While there, I met 3 guys out of the blue (in completely different programs) just around campus. I liked all of them, especially the first guy i met. We clicked instantly. But he then told me he was 33. Same thing happened with the other two, turned out to be 27 and 30. For some reason, they all looked at least 24 to me. I'm pretty sure it wasn't sex, since we've had deep conversations, they never did or hinted at anything appropriate, just told me they liked me and left it up to me.. \n It sucks because guys around my age dont approach me at all. Even the ones in my program... \n And I look my age, my friends agree and even people who I've just met have guessed my age correctly, the highest anyone ever guessed was 20.

Like most people in high school there were girls I had crushes on but never really tried to pursue due to being overweight and what i now know was generally low self-esteem. Since high school I always prioritized getting the current goal done effectively whether it was high school, college, or finding a job. To make a long story short, after few years after college I started hitting the gym with a guy who's like a brother to me. He always gave me that positive reinforcement to push myself further to the point where I could tell my self-esteem had greatly improved. In a year I'm close to my ideal weight(down 90lbs with 20lbs left), I'm able to hit a lot of fitness goals I thought previously impossible, and after some needed soul searching I'm clear on what exactly I want in life with a template of getting there. \n In doing all this I'm a lot more confident in myself to the point where I want to put myself out there into the dating world.

I posted this on the relationship subreddit aswell, but I'd like a female perspective on this as well. \n My insecure ex-GF and I split six months ago. She actually ended up dumping me after a night out where we had a huge fallout. She claimed that I had neglected her; the truth is that her poor behaviour due to her insecurity pushed me away. I listed just a few of the things: \n \n She was looking through my entire phone, text messages etc. On one occasion she hid the phone in her bra, so I couldn't get to it and she texted a platonic female friend of mine from my phone asking whether or not 'she was a virgin', implying that the friend and I had sex (which we never had). When I confronted her at the very end of our relationship with the fact that I thought she was jealous, she denied, saying that she thought she wasn't. \n She told me to 'sleep alone' if I was out without her and if I went out for dinner with a female friend, she would ask me how 'my date' went. \n She was demeaning towards my dreams, my friends and sometimes even her own friends. She was a real bully. When I pointed out her ways, she just denied, claiming she was 'just joking' and wasn't being serious. She once texted me saying that 'we'll never see each other again' (accompanied by a 'hahaha'). When I did not answer, she claimed that she was 'just joking'. Another time she called my female friends 'my bitches'. \n Our verbal fights were very intense, and I have never fought with anyone like I fought with her. She seemed to bring out the worst in me. Despite of that I remember her saying that our fights were 'nothing' compared to the fights she had had before. \n \n She was/is very insecure in general. Her mother cheated on her father when she was 10 and went on to marry the man she had an affair with. Combined with the fact that I have two close female friends, I suspect that this has/had an influence on her behaviour. \n Now I feel terrible regret/guilt that the relationship ended, thinking that I should have done more to comfort her. \nI also think that somehow I am the faulty one, as she had a seemingly successful relationship before me (3,5 yrs) and she is already dating someone new and moving in with her new boyfriend after a short period of time. \n The thing is that her behaviour pushed me further and further away. I had a gut feeling telling me that something was terribly wrong, and in the end, I didn't even bother making an effort because her behaviour was so poor. We only dated for two months. \n I could use some input on this. Should I feel guilty for being sick and tired of her behaviour and pulling away because of it?

There's a girl that I've known for a while who wouldn't really be interested in talking to me that much outside when we saw each other - I'd usually initiate the conversation and it would go on for maybe half a day where she'd take a while to get back and usually end up blanking me at some point. \n Out of nowhere she starts texting me and we've been talking throughout the day, everyday for about a month and a half.

I'm asking this because I'm honestly not sure and I don't have anyone in my life that i feel comfortable talking to about this. \n The first time I ever had sex I was 15 years old. I had been dating this boy for a couple of weeks and I was hanging out over his house with him one day when we began hooking up. He was the first boy I ever did anything with other than kiss but when it came to going all the way I told him that I wasn't ready. Well on this day, we were hooking up and he looked at me and asked me if we could have sex. I told him that I still wasn't ready and we continued to hook up. A few minutes later, I guess he got a little too excited and entered me anyway.

He seems like a nice guy, we were getting on well and didn't seem to have an agenda.

Continued to have minor yellow flags of this kind, but nothing to make me feel terribly worried. \n However, a friend of a friend happens to know him, and I asked about him under the guise of asking about something else.

I know that there are two sides to every coin, but this has thrown me a bit and kind of makes me want to call off the date - I don't know if I can entertain this kind of douchebaggery.

We were heading down the stairs along with two of her male friends, and she suddenly turned to head somewhere else.

I'm a male, 19, she is 20. \n I'm asking that, if you're into a guy, would you possibly ignore him, not looking at him, not talking to him, and so on. Unless he directly comes to you? \n So you're kinda 'forcing' him to come, but of course, only if he's also interested in you. \n I feel like I'm in this exact situation myself. So I want to know if that might be an possibility. If that is in fact. Something girls do, and not just me over-analyzing the situation... \n In my case, I have known this girl since we were born. We grew up in the same apartment building, we were great friends as kids on the playground, our families see each other as family although we're not related via blood. \n But we kinda grew a part since I went to a private school, in which you sleep in as well (boarding school, I think it's called). \n She has no reason to ignore me, the way she does. As far as I know at least, I haven't done anything that might offend her. \n And as an extra info for you, she has shown some interest in me a few times before. At weddings for example, she would sometimes come and ask me for a dance. Which is unusual in our culture for a girl to do so.. \n But when an conversation has started, then we talk like nothings wrong.

Now, I am looking to have sex with someone special, and even though I REALLY like him, the fact he had 6-8 one night stands does not agree with my sexual side.

"I know this post is probably going to make me look like an asshole, but here it goes. \n Around 3 weeks ago I(M17) first started dating my new girlfriend(F18). For the first week of the relationship everything was fairly normal, the only notable thing is that she has a few mental health issues based on past experiences, basically there are a LOT of things that are triggers for her (not her fault, she has had to deal with a lot of shit). The second week there were more issues appearing, such as controlling various aspects of my life, not taking no for an answer in any context, and feeling the need to inform me of anything she thinks I do wrong (to an obsessive amount), and becoming extremely passive aggressive if I don't respond to her texts within 5 minutes of sending them. The third week this basically had the same things happening but worse and with more frequency. She is also ""extremely in love with me"" according to her own words, if that is relevant information. \n I honestly feel trapped right now, and I'm scared to break up with her, since the last guy who did got a broken nose. Any help on how to break up with her without conflict would be greatly appreciated. \n Also a side note: I don't want to break up with her because she has any mental trauma or anything, I simply feel realy uncomfortable and trapped."

I'll try to keep this short and to the point, even though it's a looong story. \n I was friends with this guy for 5 years. He was a lonely guy, and very socially awkward, so I tried my best to befriend him, and it took off and we kept in contact over the years. However, a pattern soon emerged of him getting handsy with me and prepositioning me for sex, even though I had a boyfriend (mutual friend). My boyfriend would kick his ass, ultimately forgive him, only for creepy friend to start creeping again after the sting from getting his wrist slapped wore off. \n About 6 months ago, shit hit the fan when my friend came to ''support'' me when my boyfriend was abroad and I was having a really bad psychiatric episode. I was dissociating badly and not feeling myself. He decided to comfort me through sex and I am so ashamed to say that I let him, because in that moment I thought that it was my duty to reward him for his kindness/old beliefs about being responsible for ''making men horny'' and deserving to use me for it resurfaced. \n My boyfriend was furious but again forgave his friend, but I couldn't forgive him for it.. we broke up shortly afterwards. \n I hesitate to label what happened definitively. But at the very least, my ex-friend knew that I had been abused in the past, had shit boundaries, and he actively came on to me during a psychiatric episode. That at the very least counts as predatory, right? \n Anyway, during the time when he was doing his thing, I became somewhat close to his circle of friends, my ''acquaintance'' group mentioned in the post title. I've observed his interactions, and he's incredibly awkward and can't even look any female friends in the eye. I get the feeling that they're unsettled by his presense and wouldn't be caught dead alone with him, even without me saying anything. \n So, here's the ultimate question: do I tell a girl in the group that I grew close to and could trust about what happened? Or would it be kind of a ''no duh'' thing to say, and ultimately not worth the risk to myself? I still have to see him in person once in awhile, so if this got back to me it could be bad. In addition to being sexually abusive, he used to start arguments with me, tease me until I cried, and a few times gave warning signs that he might get violent.	My friend of many years is a sexually exploitive asshole. I'm wondering if it's worth the potential risk to myself to warn his female friends, who already seem wary of him and for whom it might not be that big of a revelation. \n Is it possible that this is just coming from a petty place of wanting to ruin his reputation?	424	61	askwomenadvice

"I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for about 5 months. I want to say our honeymoon period ended recently and I can't tell if I'm becoming way too anxious or if there's a problem with me in terms of relationship. \n I know she can be busy, but I feel like recently she just doesn't want to be seen with me in public or around friends. I feel like I constantly have to push the issue with conversation and if she does respond to me, it's with quick, short responses. After a time where she actively avoided me when we were out with our friends during spring break (I would try to sit next to her, she would go somewhere else) I confronted her and told her she made me feel unwanted. She told me she was just very independent and giving off the impression that she was ""only hanging out with her boyfriend"" wasn't her style. \n Independent ladies, I want to know what it's like to be independent from the girl's perspective and what I can do to respect this. As of now, I have no idea what a good balance is between being together and being apart and I feel like I'm putting in more to the relationship than I'm getting out of it. To me it really feels like she's being distant but I feel like I'm over analyzing and just scared of losing her."	not sure if gf is independent or just uninterested	239	9	askwomenadvice
"So I'm a 19 (M) living in Kansas and I work at a pizza shoppe. I haven't been in a relationship since my senior prom breakup in 2015, and I finally decided to go for my coworker who's 16 (F) and she's just the sweetest little thing. We had started talking a bit and she like to sit next to me and/or talk to me whenever we got a break or I was closing up shoppe. A friend of mine (17/M) wanted to go for her, and I said that he could because I figured I had 0% chance with her. She turned him down though, apparently knowing somehow that I had some feelings for her and got mad at him for trying. After that, she knew that I knew she knew (haha) and never said anything against me trying, so I did. It really did seem like she had something for me too. \n  She commonly made looks in my direction with little smiles and she is on the ""thick thighs"" side so she liked to hike her pants up in front of me all the time, as well as bending over my laptop, with me literally right there*. I asked her if she ever wanted to do something, but she stated she actually had a very tight schedule, I asked if it was that or if she just didn't like me like that, to which she smiled and said ""no its not that"". \n\n The following shift I walked her out, got ballsy, and I pecked her cheek, but she did nothing but smile and say goodbye. After a couple more attempts of flirtatious talking and making it well known to her that I liked her, she stopped me during our texts (right before my ""big moment"") and told me we're just friends, and that there never was any interest in me from the beginning. So what I want to know is, did I do or say something? Is she playing games? Is this all a bunch of miscommunication?\n\n I'm really depressed about this, as my first attempt at something in awhile was a complete failure and I'm already very hesitant about relationships due to having 4 bad past relationships. I just wanted to get to know her more as she's a brilliant girl with an open mind and heart, impressive writing skills, wonderful eyes, and a small temper that matches her height.

My boyfriend and I are both 26 and have been together two years and friends since middle school.

I'm already in the state where my grad school is but he wants me to drive back up and work until December. I do have a job I could do until then. \n I feel like we should just do long distance again for three months until he comes down. Then I could look for an apartment etc in the meantime and get going with finishing my program. He doesn't want to do that and is putting pressure on me. It's sort of my fault since I have been wishy washy and told him I would come back after visiting my family down here. My family thinks I'm making a mistake and need to start my program now.

I hate living at home with my parents but I could do it for three months. \n Is it completely ridiculous to go back and work until December?

I (22M) was just reading some of the FAQs on r/AskWomen and I was amazed at how many questions there were regarding 'creeps' (I didn't ask this question there because they're obviously sick of it but none of the FAQs really answered the question I have now so here I am). \n I've been pretty sheltered and don't know many women offline. Weirdly online most of my friends are women but it's always platonic. Typically I don't make any attempt at anything romantic or sexual even if I think the other person is interested, partly because I'm terrified of being labelled as a 'creep' (though I know that discouraging men is the point of the word).

I'm about to turn 22 years old, just graduated college, and will be starting grad school this fall. \n When I was a teenager, I had severe anxiety which contributed to the fact that I didn't have a normal high school experience. I didn't really have friends, I never dated, was too anxious to talk to any guys who approached me, etc. When I started college, I didn't want my anxiety to keep hindering me, so I started going to counseling which helped immensely. Eventually I was able to do things I was never comfortable with, I made close friends, and started dating. \n I met a guy, who eventually became my first boyfriend of about three years. He recently broke up with me, and the last two weeks have been tough. Here is some background on the relationship: \n He was my first boyfriend and the person who I lost my virginity to. However, our relationship wasn't perfect, far from it. The first couple months were great. However, things changed and I started seeing a different side of him. Long story short, he kissed another girl once, lied a lot, never really wanted to go out (he was somewhat of a couch potato), he eventually became aggressive. He suffers from some mental illnesses, but always refused to get help. I always stood by his side because I thought it was what was right considering he was going through the psychological issues, and I would feel like a terrible person for leaving him at such a time. \n I broke up with him once because I was just not happy anymore. He started crying, saying he would change, the usual spiel. And I listened and retracted the breakup. Nothing changed. \n Eventually, I wanted to break up again, but couldn't bring myself to do it. \n He ended it about a month ago because he knew I was unhappy, thought I deserved better, he needed to grow up and get help and couldn't give me what I needed, etc. \n I agreed and in a sense was relieved that he did it so I wouldn't have to. \n The first week I was okay. The past two, I've been a mess. I know being apart from him is the best thing for me. But, it doesn't change that I did love him and miss him. I keep rehashing all the major incidents, all the times he became aggressive with me (he didn't necessarily hit me except once), the cheating, the things he said and done, and I'm now overwhelmed with anger toward him and at myself for being so stupid. \n How did you handle your first major breakup?

As a 20yo, there are 3 problems I have with this, which may cause me not to be relaxed with sexuality, which is what I most want. I want to know what people in my situation usually do when they have sex. \n 1) Living with parents: \nHow do you have sex comfortably at home? Do you talk to each of your family members about privacy? Do you lock your room? Do you only do it at night? Do you wait until nobody's home? \n 2) Having no job: \nHow do you pay for sex related stuff and outings when you have no job? Do you ask for money from your parents? \n 3) Feeling immature: \nDo these things feel awkward to you? They do to me, asking for money from my mom to buy condoms/pills and then going to my room in her house and having sex. I sometimes feel ashamed of being immature in this aspect, especially since my partners may have jobs or live alone and they are on a higher footing than me.

Ok, so I should make clear from the beginning to avoid any confusion that I'm not asking for relationship advice here, so please, don't say... \n > ''The only way you're going to know is if you ask her out. We do not read minds!'' \n I'm not interested in any of these women romantically, nor do I intend to pursue them. I don't need advice on how to get a woman. Just to be perfectly clear. \n I don't expect telepathy, but rather the keen intuition and insight that only a woman can provide from their own unique experience on this round blue ball we call Earth. \n The purpose of this post is more of a very general question on psychological behaviour in men and women and whether or not there is any meaning behind these observations of mine. (So if there  are  any men here feel free to contribute!), \n So I always get told by absolute strangers how insanely attractive I am and that I should be a movie star etc. Sorry for the self-aggrandising synopsis, but it helps paint the imagery. \n Whenever I go to an eatery or a cafe I've noticed that women are always incredibly flirtatious with me. By flirtatious, I simply mean they seem interested in me as a person: they ask for my name, they prompt me about my life, they flatter me. Things you typically wouldn't do to someone if you didn't want to solicit their attention. And I don't really do anything to encourage any of this. \n Now at this point, you usually get a few people who want to doubt your claims via the argument of subjectivity. And say that my ''idea'' of flirtation is simply me misunderstanding kindness and friendliness. So let me just say that I'm not being biased when I say they are, indeed, flirting with me. It's happened too many times where it's been confirmed that these girls do want me to ask them out. (I won't get into details for the sake of brevity, but please just trust me on this). I'm not wearing rose-coloured glasses or assuming or being idealistic. \n What I've noticed, however, is whenever I go to a cafe or any venue and there is more than one female waitress at the counter, they always act non-flirtatious. They're still friendly, but not nearly as outgoing or as overt in their interest in me. I absolutely respect their right to be like this but I'm curious: am I just imagining this? \n As a girl, are you more flirtatious with a guy you're interested in when you two are alone? Girls will still be friendly to me, of course, but they won't be suggestive when they have company working alongside them. \n I've also noticed that if I go into a venue for the first time it's incredibly easy for me to strike up a conversation with a girl, and she will genuinely be enjoying herself, but whenever I make a routine of going there and familiarising myself they become gradually more shy over a period of time. Is there a reason behind this do you think? \n Sorry for the long post and disclaimer, but I've had people get a little overzealous in misconstruing my intentions in the past and attack me. So I just want to be extra clear!	As a girl, are you less flirtatious with a male stranger you're interested in when you're around company?	552	18	askwomenadvice
"Hey ladies, \n I'm struggling to figure out how to end an irritating cycle with a woman I've been friends with for over 10 years. We'd always been close but ever since I got married last year she's been acting very differently (I say since I got married because I actually haven't physically seen her since my wedding-- I don't know that it has anything to do with my marriage). Usually every 2-3 weeks she'll text me saying she misses me and we should meet up for coffee/drinks/work out/etc. I'll reply with several days/ times I am available and she will pick a time that works for her. Every single time, she cancels the day of our date, usually a couple of hours before. \n This is incredibly frustrating because she always has very convincing reasons (surprise audit at her job, got sick, dog dies, etc.) and apologizes profusely, so I feel uncomfortable being critical or angry with her. Then, a couple weeks later, she tries to set up a date again and the cycle repeats itself. I have tried offering to come to her house, meet her at her work, go to a class at the gym she frequents, etc. just to avoid this irritation and she always cancels the day of, which is very irritating because I am a planner and generally want to know my schedule. \n Yesterday we were supposed to meet at the gym. Two hours before she tells me she has a TOOTH ACHE and cannot make it. She apologizes dramatically ""please don't hate me, you know you're my best friend, I promise I'll see you next week...blah blah blah."" Keep in mind, I have never asked to see her, she is constantly setting this stuff up. \n I have not seen this woman in a year. We live 4 miles apart. \n I'm so over this, but I don't want to be an asshole. She has struggled a lot in the past and I know feeling rejected/ judged is a huge trigger for her-- I don't want to cause her any pain. We also have several mutual friends, and I don't want to strain any of those friendships either by being cruel or dismissive. \n The next time she tries to set something up, I'm planning to tell her that, while I love her, I just can't schedule something I know will be cancelled, but if she ever wants to drop by my house she is welcome any time. \n I'm just wondering if I should be more direct/ harsher? Should I cease contact with her altogether (I do text her occasionally to see how she's doing/ send her a link that reminds me of her, etc.-- should I stop this?) and just wash my hands of the friendship?"

Sorry in advance if there just isn't enough detail to go off of in this post. I'm trying to maintain gf's privacy. Here's the deal. \n My gf is going through a very depressing time (a few months at least). She has put all of the focus on herself and has recognized that I am not part of the problem, but I also can't help (my efforts result with her feeling worse). \n Many conversations have shown me that while upset, she can't pinpoint what is upsetting her. Example, some times she is sad because she isn't near any of her friends and then an hour later will be sad that she isn't on her own with no one helping her (desires independence). In other words, the source of what is upsetting her flip flops usually before our discussion is over. As a result I am very unsure as to what is truly bothering her. \n This relationship has been going on strong for almost three years and her feelings of depression didn't start until a few months ago. The same feelings would show up every couple of weeks and be a little worse each time. These emotions would follow varying events - so I don't think this is a situation where she just hates her job. \n Current situation, we've lived together for a couple of years - pretty good synergy. She has a low stress office job, but takes on a lot because of her excellent work effort. In post-bachelor's, but hasn't been accepted into a program yet because of grades. She has a very open relationship with her parents, but doesn't want them to give her advice. \n So does this sound familiar? I'm really hoping for some insight into what she might be going through. In no way do I think she needs me to fix her problem. More so, I just want to be available to her if she needs me (emotionally or what have you). I just don't think I'm coming from the proper perspective because I see that she is upset, but I can't see why.	gf is becoming more depressed by the day and can't figure out what is actually bothering her. \n edit - grammar \n update - there is a clear theme in the comments and I will take them to heart.

Background; I have been dating my SO for 4years now. We are both 25. Living together going on two. I Love her first off and want to fix this for our potential future together. I started dating this young independent professional and it is was attracted me to her. Everything was great for a good while. As the relationship has moved along it started with little things that I figured showed me she cared and loved me as well(not wanting to go to any party/get together separately)(even if it was inconvenient for me to pick her up, I would pick her up every time so she wouldn't have to go alone). I didn't mind this so much. Once we moved it together the slide continued. Slowly but over the last 2 years it was gone from little things to not being able to sleep apart(or sleep at different times). I like to go to the gym late so its a problem. She will call me from the next room to do something for her that she could easily do her self, but its an inconvenience so she calls me over. I do this every time, and I have mentioned to her how I feel. The one time I refuse I seem to come off like an asshole for not wanting to. There are alot of little things as well. If we are sitting on the couch and she needs something she will never get up to go get it. If she is by herself ya sure of course, but if I'm with her no way. \n All of her morning time is spend getting ready and I prepare everything else she needs. Anytime that I need or want to go do something that interferes with something, that is of inconvenience to her wants she eventually will let me go but not without a struggle.

"Hi ladies, \n I have been with my boyfriend for almost 3 and a half years now. We met when we were 16 and have been together since. He is my first boyfriend, kiss, everything else. Our relationship was pretty solid up until about maybe 5 months ago, then it became kind of like a rollercoaster. One of the main issues my boyfriend has is that I have never initiated sex. Not once. At the beginning, I was just very shy since it was all new to me so I never initiated it. Then I went on birth control and then my sex drive literally became almost nonexistent. I never initiated because I was never really ""in the mood"" until he would put me in the mood, so to speak. Like if he initiated sex then I would get in to it. He has told me about this and I always tell myself that I will do something about it, but I don't feel confident in doing it and I guess I don't know what I would do. \n So my question is, what do you do to initiate sex with your SO and how can I feel more confident/comfortable in doing so?"

It makes me feel sort of scared, she's the kind of person that everyone loves and everyone will want to get her fucked up so she has the best time.

"My friend and I (both 21F) got into a fight a few hours ago over the phone. Her birthday was this past weekend, which overlapped with other plans I had over the weekend. We've known each other since the 6th grade, and have been through a lot together. We're best friends, and would even go as far as calling each other sisters. So here's a little backstory: After spending the day together, we planned to meet up at midnight (on her official bday) to go out for drinks. Since I worked earlier that morning, I ended up taking a very long nap on my bf's couch, awaking to her phone call later that night asking when I would be arriving to have drinks. I ended up declining, since I had just woken up and it was already late. A short while later, she posts a cryptic Facebook status saying how she should have never planned to do anything on her bday in the first place, which I took offense to, since not only did we hang out that day but also had made plans to get birthday brunch the next morning. \n The whole ""sub-tweeting"" thing had really rubbed me the wrong way, since I knew it was about me obviously. I brought it up to her over the phone after telling her earlier today that we needed to talk, hoping that I could voice my concerns while also hearing her side of the story. Long story short, the phone call quickly turns into a screaming match with her calling me ""petty"" and saying that she wouldn't think that I would get offended over something like that. Throughout the entire phone call, she was being extremely disrespectful and condescending while also screaming at me, while I respected her and listened to her points even when I disagreed with them. She would even make snide side comments as I was talking, saying things like, ""woooooow...."", ""oookaaaay..."", etc. I was blown the fuck away by how rude she was being. I could/would never, ever speak to her the way she spoke to me during our phone call and I'm very much considering ending our friendship. \n 10 years is a lot of history, so it's extremely difficult for me to decide if I want to move on or try to patch things up with her, but tbh I don't want to be friends with anyone who is rude and inconsiderate of others, and she has a bit of a history of this.

"For a bit of reference: \n I'm a 30/M and she's a 25/F. \n I'm on a trip in Japan (we're from the United States) with a girl I've known for about 4 years now. We've also been to Africa climbed Kilimanjaro a year prior. I know her because I used to work with her and we were really close then. I quit the job we used to work together right before we went to Africa and we don't really see each other as much, maybe about once every 1 or 2 months, if that after I quit my job. We're still cool, we just don't see each other as much. We've never kissed or anything like that. \n Well, now I'm on my second of 3 weeks in Japan with her. We share the same bed sometimes because we're on a budget and will grab any room possible in the cities we visit. She'll sleep as far away as possible from me or if our elbows touch on the train she'll move away as fast as possible. It's not even like she's moving away because she's shy. Seems more like she's moving away to prove a point. I haven't made any blatant advances because I don't want to put our friendship at risk. \n It sucks because it makes me feel really repulsive of a person. Like a touch of my skin will give her grey scale. I get it, I'm like Jorah Mormont and forever friendzoned but does she have to be so snappy about it? I love her but she's making me feel like I'm the grossest thing to ever grace this planet. \n I guess my question is: How do I enjoy my trip here in Japan without feeling like I'm a sack of shit because it seems like she's so grossed out by me when we accidentally touch elbows or share beds and sleeps on the very edge? She's attractive to me so naturally I wouldn't mind but she on the other hand does. How do I get passed this? I just want to get over this. Most of my guy friends are like, ""How do you go on a trip with a girl and not have sex?"". I ask myself the same thing. Why does she not want to have sex on such an awesome vacation and for so long?

I may be over thinking this, but I happened across a girl I had a bit of a crush on in one of my classes last semester on social media.

Hi r/askwomenadvice \nI need your help! I can\u2019t really tell if this girl likes me? \n So there is a girl, lets call her Susie. \n Susie and I are coworkers, kinda. We are both Resident Assistants (RAs) - if that means anything. I talked with susie everyday last semester from school to personal life and such. We kinda flirted back and forth and she always laughs at my jokes no matter how bad or subtle they are. Over the break we have been snapchatting everyday over break. \n She sent me a message a few days ago saying that she\u2019s excited to be single this semester after waiting for a guy to want to be with her all last semester. Her last boyfriend was over a year ago and hasn't been with anyone since. \n Lately, I've been trying to move from snapchat to texting and she hasn't been replying as much unless its involving work really. Over snapchat she\u2019ll talk to me all day\u2026 its weird. Right? \n In the beginning of the year, she said that she wouldn't want to date a coworker again but, overtime we talk she describes the guy that she likes exactly like me. Every time without fail . \n Is she trying to send signals? \n If it helps\u2026 I do want to ask her out when she gets back before the semester beings. I know this isn't r/Dating_Advice or r/Relationships - so I wont ask about asking her out. But I do know you can help me decipher if she likes me! \n How could I ask her out, should I just go for it? \n Thanks!	Girl I like laughs at my jokes and we talk for at least an hour every day.

My girlfriend(f 17) and me (m 17) have been dating for 9 months and we have an amazing relationship. We are completely in love and we turn to each other for everything. \n Recently she's been posting a lot of selfies on instagram.

I don't wanna ask her directly cause she might get defensive. \n So my questions are: Is she looking for attention? If so, from who? Am I just over thinking this? Is my opinion not good enough? Is my attention not sufficient? Or is this just a harmless way to express herself? Is it to feel pretty?	Girlfriend posts a lot of selfies. Is she looking for attention other than me?

"Good afternoon, ladies. This is actually the first time that I have posted on this subreddit ever! Nonetheless, I do have a good question and it would very helpful to receive the much needed feedback. \n As such, allow me to tell you of a very rough three day stretch in which I turned to the bottle for ""help"" It all started this past Thursday where I was called into work after I had agreed to a date with ""Kali"" someone who I thought I did know a lot about and just last Sunday had an excellent date with her. \n ""Kali"" is a person that I met in my speech class that I took over this past summer and I grew to like her after we had exchanged emails and gave me some praise over my scripts. \n She possessed a lot of the same interests as me thus it was only fitting that I attempt to date her. \n Nonetheless, I knew I wanted to get the money since I would also be working that Saturday so ten hours of work means I would be getting a nice paycheck in a few weeks. Nonetheless, I paid for her ticket and watched them be on their way the next day. \n Later on after I had got home, I figured that I would message her and ask her how did the movie go and she exposited upon a subplot that was not to her liking because of her past issues where she told me about beforehand. \n I tried to get her to talk about it and she shut me down in which I send her two extra long messages telling her that she is okay and to make sure that she does not do anything stupid i.e. harming themselves. She did not and it got worse from there. \n Long story short, a lot of people think that I am nuts because I tried to show support for a friend whom I was interested in and of course I now have a lot of those people basically talking down to me as if I am a fifteen year old kid. I am not despite thinking like one with the dating stuff. \n I am now just breaking out of the funk as I type this. \nand I must ask you all here, where do I go from here?

"I know this is a silly place to ask this sort of question, but I am genuinely out of people to ask since this chick and I have so many mutual friends in common. \n I have had a friend, we will call her Beth, for six years now. Starting out Beth was a great friend and we became very, very close through a writing group. We are talking texting each other 24/7 and sharing all our secrets/best friend situation. Three years into our friendship we had a falling out because I basically called her on being in an emotionally abusive relationship and tried to explain that myself and several of her other friends were worried. I told her that I experienced similar things in my own abusive relationship, and she freaked on me. She called me expletives, told me that I was paranoid about any man because of my relationship with that guy, and threw the fact I was raped in my face as an excuse why I was a ""jealous psycho"". She then went to all of our mutual friends and told them I was a psycho and told them about my mental health issues, about the rape too, then they all cyber bullied me. They tormented me for months cropping up in the writing groups I had joined later and causing trouble, sending me mean messages on social media calling me names and making fun of my anxiety, and sending texts telling me to kill myself (knowing I had struggled with suicidal thoughts in the past) \n I eventually got her to leave me alone for two years, and we didn't speak at all during this time. When she found out I was still active on the writing groups some of our friends were in, about six months ago, she reached out to me and we agreed we were both wrong in the mean things we said. She apologized for the mean things she said and begged for my forgiveness. I told her that of course I forgave her and that we could move past it. I always try to give people second chances, since I have screwed up and appreciated when people did the same for me. So we fell back into being best friends and I went back to confiding in her about some things. She set me up in a short-lived online relationship with her agender (bio female) friend too. I felt like things had really changed! \n Until they didn't. She began to exhibit the same toxic pattern we had when she and I were friends before. But my problem is that now she has MORE ""dirt"" on me and I am terrified that if I stop speaking to her that she will spread more of my personal business around or perhaps even contact the guy I am interested in and ruin things. I am 100% in the closet regarding my sexuality, and Beth knows that. I am also treading VERY carefully with my crush since he is a total introvert and has some things in his past that have affected him. Basically I am trying not to rush things with him despite the very strong feelings I have for him and have expressed to Beth. She knows his first and last name, which the combo there of makes it pretty easy for people to find him on Facebook. I am terrified she will message him and ruin it. \n I feel like I am almost being blackmailed into being her friend. But I just have to get away from her. Our communication is totally online and through text messages. So there is no risk of face to face altercations."	I made the mistake of befriending a formerly toxic friend, wrongly assuming she had changed, and now I can't figure out how to stop being her friend without her trying to ruin my life and tormenting me (like she did last time).	613	42	askwomenadvice

She responds to me super happy saying yes and she was so excited. So early December we go on the date, things went really well. We seem to have great chemistry. Then about 2 weeks later, we went and got breakfast together on campus. Always playing with her hair, smiling, dressing real cute. Before winter break she told me she wanted to hangout and smoke together (potential to hook up here), I said definitely. Turns out she was super busy over break with work and other shit. I texted her a few times making advances, and still too busy always using sad face emojis though..

In high school, I made two friends, F and D. The three of us grew to be extremely close, they are the absolute best friends anyone could have. We developed a special friendship with each other. We can be totally honest with each other, we care about how we treat each other, we are on the same wavelength, we have all pretty much agreed that we are family forever. \n F has a sister who is a year younger, G. G would hang out with us sometimes, but we were never particularly close. After college, she ended up marrying young into a mediocre relationship despite people telling her not to. Her husband cheated on her so she got a divorce, she was obviously messed up about it. We invited her to hang out more with us because she needed new friends and emotional support, she eventually became a part of our group. For the first few months it seemed like she was doing okay. \n But, things have gone downhill since then. She has become estranged from her parents and has fallen into a deep depression. One of her family friends passed away. Her cat she got with her ex died of some kind of fatal disease. She has been through a lot, and we know what is it is like to be depressed, and for some time we gave her some leeway. \n G herself is low-key suicidal, never to the point where we felt we had to call the cops, she has self-harmed a couple times though. She has been in therapy for a while but it doesn't seem to be helping. She has become extremely dependent on us, constantly treating us like her therapists. She has a questionable relationship with illegal drugs. She has also become promiscuous and is constantly casually dating someone or other. She is also sometimes passive aggressive. \n It has been three years since the divorce. THREE DAMN YEARS. So we are now at today, F & D and I don't feel like we can hang out anymore without including G because she has entrenched herself into our group. Any time she detects that we are irritated with her or feeling distance she becomes even more clingy and manipulative. We're afraid that having an intervention with her and telling her that we are upset with her behavior and how she treats us will make her more suicidal. And we can never really get rid of her because she is F's sister. \n While we still care for her and wish she would get better, and there was a lot to love about her before the divorce. We are giving up hope. She has made zero improvement since the divorce. Things have actually gotten worse. The friendship is causing us so much stress than joy and we are all resentful of the fact that she is dragging down the initial friendship that the three of us had. It seems like everything nowadays is about how depressed or self destructive or reckless she is. \n We are completely and utterly at a loss. We don't really want to have her in the group anymore unless she drastically improves, which we hope she will, but we can't get totally stop being friends with her because she is F's sister. I don't want to deal with her suicidal, clinginess for the rest of my life. And we all have no idea how to go about another intervention because and we don't want to make her more suicidal and it doesn't seem like anything would change, she has no other friends. She is F's sister after all, we would feel guilty forever if something happened.	Friend's sister joined friend group, stressing us out due to mental illness and self destructive behavior, have no idea how to improve situation. Cannot just cut her off because we care for her and she is one of our's sister.	611	40	askwomenadvice

I'm on mobile so can't do that male /female thing, but I'm a 15 years old male from Denmark. \n So a few weeks ago I held a party, and for about the last 40~ minutes of it, I had a conversation with this girl. The party was exclusively my class and the other class on same grade, so I obviously knew this girl, but I didn't 'know' her. Man. She's so sweet, so cute, and so geniuly good hearted it's crazy. But she's also shy, so very shy, and this is where I need all the help I can get. The day after the party we wrote together, and she seemed to like me. I thought so at least. \n Her friends are constantly trying to bring me and her together, and it's almost a running joke in my class by now (which is really unfortunate). I feel bad for her, I didn't want it to be this way. Her best friend has been telling me that she really wants her to be happy, and she thinks I could help with that, but this is where I face a wall again. Last party (it should be said that we haven't written together ever since, and we haven't seen each other in person) it seemed like she completely tried to avoid me. She didn't do it directly until the end of the party, where I asked her to go for a walk with me, and she rejected, slipped past me and went outside to some other people. I felt really broken at that moment, because I felt like we had so much to talk about, and it was a perfect time to do it. \n After the party I asked her friend if she knew anything , and she said that she pushed her to take a walk with me and she didn't want it to be that way. Now I don't know what to believe. I don't know if she actually likes me, and I'd I should go for a kiss next Saturday. All her friends say she is really shy, and the conversation we had at my place was just amazing, with a lot of sensual eye contact. Maybe she hates me. Who knows? Oh, and to make the world situation worse, I was seen talking to another girl last Saturday and now the rumour is that she would do me, and that we kissed... we didn't, but my crush has probably heard something else. \n So, sorry about that long post, but it's driving me insane.

"Long story short, manager recently wrote me up for supervileous behavioral incidents. This came at a time when she was extremely stressed out, and I wholeheartedly believe this is the reason for her actions towards me.

This was not brought to my attention, as the person who's information was incorrect,  went to the graphic designer who then made the changes and reordered the collateral. But still blamed me for the loss in departmental funds. \n I've lost all confidence in my job. She made it apparent and very harshly that if I continued to make mistakes I would be further disciplined but could very well be terminated. This to me is unfair as most of these allegations are not my fault. \n She stated I am stressing out my coworkers-meaning her as I only work directly with her, and with emphasis that I am ""a weak link"".

I don't want to cause her drama, I don't think telling someone who to be with or not to be with has ever worked, I know that in the past I've been with someone not good for me I had to realize it myself, so I was wondering if this would be considered too intimate: Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory \n It's a snoogle and the women on the babubump subreddit say it's supposed to be very comfortable. \n I already pay for her cellphone bill (it's only 10 dollars a month to add her to my family plan) this already annoys him but they are both bad with money, sometimes he goes weeks without a cell phone because of lapsed payment. The idea of her not being able to call the cops if needed makes me too nervous to stop though. It's 10 bucks a month for peace of mind. \n Thanks for reading all that. Sorry it's so long."	Does a body pillow seem to intimate? I feel like it isn't, but because of those weird Japanese ones I'm not sure if there's some kind of stigma attached to all of them.	419	33	askwomenadvice
"Hey \n Not sure if this the right place to post. \n Little background about myself and why I'm asking this. \n So I am (21/M), my job is a nightclub photographer and I live in the UK. I am ashamed that I am a virgin, it not intentional it just sex never happened to me. I know I should not be ashamed about being a virgin but it's really bothers me. From the age of 18 I never felt happy about being a virgin but I had high hopes about getting laid especially since I worked in a popular nightclub. On top of that I don't really know how to have sex (I am a strange one as I am not into porn). \n Why am I asking the question: So I went on my first ever first ever date (she's 18/F) and it went really well (she wants to meet again and hinting relationship) towards end our date she brought up sex in our conversation. She talked briefly about her sex life and said she had sex a few times, then she asked about mine, I said I never had sex she then replied with a surprised ""OH"". She asked what I knew about sex I was honest and said I know the very basic of sex which includes what hole to put it in and basic of fingering. She replied with something like ""you need to learn a lot"" which I agreed on. For some odd reason it really hurt my feelings having the sex conversation and I felt really ashamed about being a virgin and for my lack of knowledge of sex. \n Additional information on me: I am deaf but I can hear well via Cochlear Implant and can speak normally. I am also socially awkward but I do have friends and I am poplar at the club I work at (the clubbers get overly excited when they see me and love hugging and kissing me along with selfies). Oh and the Subreddit /r/amisexy confirmed that I don't look too bad."	Would you be okay with your boyfriend being a virgin.	341	10	askwomenadvice
I've [21F] been dating my SO [22M] for almost 2 years now and I'm graduating in May. My SO was supposed to graduate last year, but hasn't been doing well in school and is now due to graduate in 2 years. \n I've been thinking about what I want to do after college, such as where I want to live and when I'll begin to start a new chapter of my life (maybe a family). There's a few aspects that we have different viewpoints on. For example, he's made it clear that he doesn't want kids(he says maybe he'll feel differently someday though) which is something I absolutely do want. \n Now anytime I bring the next few years up he avoids all conversations and says there's still plenty of time before either of us should think about that stuff and he isn't thinking about anything but school. Do you think he's right and I'm just jumping ahead in life to quickly or is it acceptable for me to consider my future goals and desires when dating at this point in my life? \n Any advice and opinions are appreciated!

Husband (27), me (f/27) I'm really clueless as how I should proceed. We're on a month long holiday to my husband's home country for Christmas.  He hasn't been home in over 5 years so I've tried to really let him enjoy himself. \n He's set a crazy agenda- we've gone all over the country by bus visiting friends and relatives and doing tourist activities he was too poor to do growing up. We've had a few minor conflicts abut him being inconsiderate-- making plans he knows I'll be uncomfortable with, ordering meals he knows I won't be able to tolerate, etc, but I've gone along with everything  (even got sick because I agreed to eat something we both knew I shouldn't) because I really wanted him to have a fantastic trip. \n My only request was that he not go out drinking without me, because he is not great with moderation and will spend hours buying his mates round after round if no one puts a stop to it and his friends here have no responsibility, no families, and no money so they're happy to have him . He agreed we'd only go out as a couple.  I don't usually drink but as a compromise I have gone out 5 or 6 times on  what I would consider heavy binges-- out till well past 3 AM, including the last 3 nights in a row. \n Yesterday I hurt my ankle so I told him we need to take it easy for a day or two. Well, he arranged a party for himself with his high school mates anyway. I asked him several times not to go, because I obviously couldn't go with him, my phone doesn't work in this country so I can't call him, and I am not fluent in the language so I couldn't even find him if I went out looking. I didn't yell or cry or anything,  tried to be very logical. he agreed my request was reasonable but he went anyway-- promising he'd be home by closing time  (2 AM). \n I waited up, he didn't come back. He finally stumbled in at 9 AM and I lost it. Screaming, cursing, you name it. I felt like i was going nuts. He said the party didn't work out so he drank at a friends house all night, like that some how makes it okay to leave me for over 10 hoursand spend God knows how much . I told him to take a nap because we're going home today, and I'm seriously considering ending the trip (a week early.) He's asleep on the couch right now, but I'm really unsure about what I should do when he gets up. \n I feel so disrespected, like such a fool. I've given him every thing he's wanted all month (including paying for the airfare and tons on spending money), and he just takes more and more. This seems out of character but I'm worried if I don't handle it right he'll continue to see me as a doormat. \n What should I do when he gets up?

"Was wondering if I could get some opinion/insight on my current situation. I'll try keep it as brief as possible. \n Connected with a 25 year old woman on Coffee Meets Bagel (dating app). She is an actress who just moved to my city in order to star in a big theater production. She messaged me first asking how I was doing, and from there we talked for a while. Near the end of the convo she gave me her number (I hadn't asked for it yet) and told me to text her later to set up a date. \n Few days later, we go on a date during her dinner break (she has rehearsal to at least 9:30 every night). The date goes well, she's very attractive and has a bubbly personality. There was a lot of laughter and good conversation. A couple small awkward moments as well, but we laughed them off. At the end I walked her back and as I dropped her off at the theater, she told me to hit her up this weekend. A few hours later after the date, she texts me and we chat a little longer. \n This past Friday around 5 I texted her what my plans were for the night and asked her what hers were. She gets back to me at 10:30 that night asking me where I was at. Told her I was at a friend's but would be going out afterward. She doesn't respond. When my friends and I head to the bar I text her where we are going. Again, she doesn't respond. I do not text her again that night. \n Yesterday morning she texts me apologizing for the night before saying she had to go home cause of ""work calls"", and tells me to let her know what I'm up to for that night. EDIT: Forgot to mention this originally, but I text her back that morning saying that I will let her know my plans once I figure them out. She doesn't respond. I then text her around 7:30 PM disclosing my plans, and ask her what time she would be free to meet up later. I don't get a text back from her until 1:45 AM, and the response is simply ""Ah"". Thats it. I haven't responded to it nor has she sent me any further texts today. \n So I'm not sure what to make of the situation or what my next move would be. My friends have told me its most likely that shes extremely busy seeing as the show opens on Tuesday, and that I should still pursue. But I'm not sure. I figure I could just wait till Tuesday to text her saying something along the lines of ""Good luck in the show"" and then follow up saying we should meet again sometime this week.

My girlfriend (30/f) lives in the 4th floor of an apartment and less than 20 feet our the window is another building where you can see in 20 windows if you wanted - and vice versa. \n She keeps her blinds open at all times and the way her room is situated she puts on (or takes off) underwear in front of one window and gets dressed (or undressed) directly in front of the other window.  Even for sex, blinds open.  Blinds open 100% of the time.  Her living room windows also face the same way and she usually just wears panties to walk around in. \n She says the open blinds aren't for her fun - just easier to not mess with the blinds. She says she doesn't really think much about it. \n Doesn't add up for me...  I'd prefer she acknowledge she likes the (potential) attention and move on.  Right now it just feels like she doesn't want to tell me the truth - which really would be more fun to me! \n Do you care about your blinds being open/closed?  If not, do you care if someone can see you changing, etc.?  Any excitement to it or just the way it goes?	My gf is naked in front of her windows all the time but says there's nothing stimulating about it - just easier not to mess with the blinds. \n UPDATE - I should have clarified, she prefers the blinds to be open for sex.

"Hello Women! \n I've been seeing a woman in her mid-twenties for about a month who experiences sensations I'm not familiar with, and am hoping someone here can lend some insight. \n A few important notes up-front: \nWe're new partners, have had sex together a handful of times now. She's not as experienced as I am nor is she as open to talking about sex. She's even stated that she'd rather ""just do the thing"" instead of talk about it first. I understand the discomfort comes from being intimidated and inexperienced, and have been easing her into talking about the things that make her uncomfortable. \n I'm 40, male, and have mostly been in long-term relationships, though for the past year have had multiple partners. All in all my sex life has been pretty healthy, and I take great interest in pleasing my partners. Corny as it may sound, sex to me is less about the destination and more about the journey. \n Now for the ""Ask"" part: \nWhat's baffling to me is two-fold: \n1) playing with her nipples makes her nauseous, no matter how gentle I am. It happens rather quickly. Not to the extent that she will start heaving or gagging, but the sensation will make her nauseous. I don't know if this matters but she's usually laying on her back when this happens. \n2) She orgasms very quickly, which itself isn't a problem. It's what comes after: she can't be touched or even breathed on for a good 5-10 minutes. She rolls away from me and stays that way until the sensation is gone. \n In all the partners I've had, I've never experienced either of these situations. I'm patient with her, and am willing to see this through. But even she doesn't know what this is all about. She apologizes and thinks it makes her a bad lover, which I think (and tell her) it doesn't. True that it's a little frustrating to me because I'm so used to touching and embracing after orgasms, but I want to help her figure this out. \n Any insight is greatly appreciated!"	My partner can't be touched for 5-10 minutes after she has an orgasm, and gets nauseous from having her nipples played with.

"Me [25F] and my boyfriend [24M] of 12 months are postgraduate students in the same city. We've talked about our respective thoughts on marriage, children, all kinds of stuff before, but never really focused on a specific long-term plan, partly because I think we both assumed we'd be here together for several more years doing our PhDs and there wasn't really a need to plan out anything further yet. \n Now his supervisor has abruptly (less than 2 weeks ago) announced that he's moving to another university about 500km away and given my boyfriend and his other supervisees the option to also move, which they would have to do by mid-Sept. His current research would stay here, but the expectation is that he could get similar funding for a different project. My boyfriend has visited this other university before because he also applied there for undergraduate and postgraduate programmes but didn't go, and from his description it sounded like he doesn't like the campus or people very much but thinks the research they're doing is as good or better than his current department. \n He told me about all of this earlier this week, and also told me that he thinks he'll probably go. I don't understand why. It's not definite either way until he moves. We also discussed long distance and both agreed we would be terrible at it (we both hate phoning people and find video-calling extremely awkward and avoid it) so if he goes it looks like we're breaking up. He also told me he's trying to ignore the fact he'll lose all his friends if he makes this move, which I think is a really silly thing to be ignoring given how important I think those support systems are during your PhD... \n Anyway, the summary is that we've argued about this choice, but I don't understand at all why he would choose to leave and his only explanation is the research is good. Usually we're good at talking things out but this situation just leads to us having terrible arguments every time it comes up. Any advice for non-confrontational ways of pointing out that I think he's making a huge mistake? Any thoughts on how I can better understand why he might choose this? Any suggestions on how I can get him to think about the importance of all the things I feel like he is ignoring? To me it seems like a ""grass is green on the other side"" decision but maybe I am missing something. I'm really sad because I want him to stay here like I thought we were planning. He's very willing to talk about the situation more but I feel like neither of us are getting our position across to the other."

"Hi r/askwomenadvice, I (M24) hope I can get some advice on my current condition with this girl (F25) I am seeing. \n So, we met through Tinder about 2.5 months ago and, while it started slow (we don't really share many things in common), we manage to reach that stage where we talk daily about daily stuffs and other random stuffs. So far, we have only met 4 times as of yesterday, mostly because we are currently not in the same country (me being the one who is overseas for work. I matched with her when I was on weekend holiday back home). \n Now, I really like this girl. While I can't really explain it explicitly myself, it just feels comfortable being with her, being able to open up myself to her (not a big fan of talking about my problems to anyone, really). And I could tell that she likes me too as she is doing things that I guess females won't do if we were just friends (Disclaimer: We are Asians, from and staying in Asia, so we are more reserved in a way). For example, we were watching a movie yesterday, and she was okay with me reaching out to hold her hands. She also did that thing where she put her head on my shoulders. So, considering that she kept talking to me even though we don't really many common things to talk about, and what happened in the cinema, I told her how I felt for her over dinner and asked how she felt for me. \n This is where the issue is. She told me she was still not 100% sure. I am not sure how to put this in proper English, so I am just going to give a rough excerpt of what she said. \n ""I am unsure because while I do have feelings for you, I'm still being hold back because I would still be okay too if we were not to meet again"" \n From there, she said that we will just have to move forward and see how it goes, but she's okay too if I don't want to wait for her. While I am okay with waiting for her, I am just confused with her not giving a care whether I wait or not. It actually makes me doubt whether she really do like me. I have asked and she told me that this has actually happened before to her, and the other guy did drift apart and she wasn't really too bothered with it. \n So, I am unsure what to do now. I really want to wait, but I am afraid that I am being left hanging without actually having any real hope. I hope you guys can give me advice on this. Thanks!"

She doesn't know many people there but he grew up there and knows everyone. He's very attractive and goes to great lengths to charm everyone he meets. \n I realized he was insecure soon after they got together. He read her private journal and got upset over things she did before they started dating. He made her cut contact with her male friend for 2 years even though he was gay.

"Hello ladies! \n Recently, I met this girl through some volunteer work. We hardly get time to get to know each other due to our conflicting assignments and schedules, but every blue moon we happen to be at the same place at the same time. \n But here is part of the issue. I have a really hard time with the whole dating scene. Actually, I haven't been on a date in....6 years. And that one time, wasn't much of a date because she abruptly pretended to go the bathroom and just bailed on the date. Mostly because girls just don't find me attractive. I have the whole ""too nice"" thing that I can't seem to shake. Anyways, the reason why I am saying this is because over my lifetime I get the chance to meet many really amazing girls and that seem to like me, until I make some kind of move. Then I find out they were not interested in me. And trust me, I have made attempts to change/adjust myself from going to the gym to getting some dating advice from ""bar gurus guys"", and a series of haircuts that will be a nice comedic conversation sometime in my later years. \n So, here I am again. With my aim set on this girl, I really don't want to screw this up. And I will say this girl is different. \n One, we have a bit of a language barrier. I mean, she speaks English pretty well. But you can clearly tell it isn't her first language and she is taking lessons. But I have been doing some online studying of greetings and trying to understand her culture a little better. And I am also really interested in her culture. But I don't want to make it feel like I like her because of her culture. \n Second, I usually go for really hot girls. Like the ones that seem to be constantly hit on guys on a daily basis. One of few reasons I'm glad I was born without Brad Bitt looks but dread looking more like Quasimodo (yeah, for a few years, I was called that). Anyways, I don't get that vibe from her. I mean, she is really...tastefully conservative instead of look at my boobs or obligatory sexy pose. Which seems to become more and more of a rarity (no offense). Or at least, it isn't obvious. And I'm thinking, I hit a gold mind or there is something extremely wrong and I'm too oblivious to notice it aka ""crazy""? \n Besides all of this, the small time(and when I mean small I mean a couple of minutes maybe a lunch break a most) we seem to get along pretty well. We are both kind of space cadets when it comes to thinking. And for the first time in a while, I feel like I have met someone that is a little more space cadet than me.

M/16] met this girl [F/15] at my college open day. We've become really close as we have simillar tastes in everything. Ive expressed the fact i like her and we have been flirting for the past month, she told me that she does like me but needs a little more time to see if she wants to be in a relationsip with me (that was 2 weeks ago) we have been flirting and ive opened up to her about some of the darker parts of my past and shes been supportive. \n However tonight felt pretty off, normally she would reply to texts and snapchats instantly and never just leave them open without a reply, but a couple of times today she just didnt say a thing. I cant help but think that shes getting uninterested in me.\nWhat do you think? And what should i do?	met girl [15] been flirting ive told her i like her she said she likes me but needs more time to see if she wants to be in a relationship, today she felt kind of distant (avoiding messages or not replying) what can i do?

So, I'm (19M) planning to ask out a girl (19F) I've liked for quite a while to prom, and I was planning to leave flowers and a letter at her desk. Now my question is, is it more meaningful/better to keep the writing in the letter a fancy font that I would write out, or just keep the font in my own handwriting?	Should I write a prom letter in my own handwriting or write it all fancy calligraphy style?	63	17	askwomenadvice
There are so many things I want to talk about, but I think the focus of this post is going to be this:  I'm a good guy, but I have some hangups in the bedroom due to scarce and bad past experience, and I have some insecurity about being able to make someone I actually like happy (in all ways). \n My background: I've had 2 girlfriends. First relationship was long, mostly long-distance, and unhealthy in a bunch of ways. Sex wasn't very good, especially for her. 2nd relationship was very brief and troubled for other reasons. Sex was more enjoyable for both though, and we were learning to work around our issues. Broke up for unrelated reasons. In both these relationships I had issues with coming too soon and with keeping it up, especially when it came to PIV. I almost hooked up/got into a thing with someone else after the 2nd relationship, but she ditched me after I couldn't get it up for her. \n Anyway, I am not super concerned about the ED and PE issues I've had because I know they're incredibly common, and I have every reason to experience them. (Having performance anxiety, body image issues, etc.) I'm confident I can get over them and have great sex if I can just get the chance to get really comfortable with someone and build myself up a bit. \n But now I'm on the verge of getting into something with a woman who, so far, I really like. I haven't felt this kind of connection with someone for a long time--I forgot how this even feels. Everyone I've dated since my first relationship has been someone I would have been settling for, whether I realized it at the time or not. But I realize it now. The point is, I wasn't super devastated when the last girl I was seeing lost all interest after our first disappointing hookup. But with this one, I would be. \n Anyway I'm sorry this is so unnecessarily long, here is my question: we're going on our second date on Monday. (I know that's super early to be so serious about someone, but just take my word for it--I'm not delusional about how genuine and mutual our connection has been so far.) I'm thinking I should probably try to hold off on sex until I've cemented a stronger emotional bond between us. That way, when I inevitably have penis problems the first time we hook up, she'll be more open to the idea of helping me work through it. What's scary, of course, is the possibility that she loses interest if I'm not putting out. \n I guess what I should be asking is: how do you communicate this succinctly to someone when they invite you inside for chilled netflix?	I'm totally smitten with someone and I'm so afraid that I'm going to mess it up for so many reasons, including by being a disappointing lay. Need advice on whether to put off sex until she's more emotionally invested, and how to communicate that, and any other advice you think is relevant. \n Thank you.	464	54	askwomenadvice
So I met this girl (friends in common) I thought she was cute so I added her on facebook and started a conversarion. All started well the topics were good, sometimes flirty( not from her, she is not that straightfoward). Later on she gave me her number without me even asking ( she said if i needed any care ;) to call her, she is a doctor). On another week, our friend in common even asked me out to a lunch where all her girlfriends were going (the girl i was talking to included), spent some quality them with them. Few weeks later i thought screw it and asked her out and she said no. At first I didn't understand why but then I moved on. So a week later she starts up a conversarion again and nowadays we talk every week maybe more, we watch series together and talk about our day and films and funny videos or experiencies (nothing like she asking for advice on a guy or something like that). Honestly I'm starting to lose my mind here and posting for the first time. What am I looking up to? Do you think that she just wants to be friends or can I try and later on ask her out again since months have passed. I'm receiving mixed feelings from her, i really don't know what to do and it's tearing me apart.	met a girl, we talk a lot, she looked like she liked me (gave me her number, her friends invited me to a lunch with them etc) when i asked her she said no, but later on started talking to me again and we talk a lot(about movies, funny stuff and are currently watching a series together).

Hey everyone! \n I'm 25F and started a new job that I am not excited about and elements of it have been triggering my anxiety. I also often have shaky health and don't feel well, which in turn also triggers my anxiety making me feel worse, so it can be a struggle not to call in sick on days I probably can push through. \n It is only my second week at this job and I called in sick. I am so mad at myself for not powering through, but I was unwell all night so by the time my alarm went off I had already convinced myself to call in even though I wasn't too bad in the morning. I reasoned that I already don't love the environment/care much about the job and what if I got worse while I was there? \n Does anyone have some tips on pushing yourself to follow through with commitments you dread despite how you feel?

Hello, \n I'm not sure if this is the right place for this question but here it goes. \n Last night (new years morning between 1-3 am) I was out with a couple friends (both guys). We are all in our early twenties. \n We ended up in a bar owned and run by our friends. A couple meters away there are 3 girls (late teens - early twenties). I spotted one of them (who greatly resembled my ex english teacher). She stared at me a couple times, and we unintentionally locked eyes twice. \n I tried to carry on minding my own business, and not look in her direction. My two friends then decided to go out for a smoke, while I stayed inside as I was cold. \n The very moment my friends left, the said girl walked over to me, says a few words, and proceeds to give me two unopened beers, and a half bottle of whiskey. She says her friends had enough and didnt want the drinks to waste. So she gave them to me. \n Thing is, last night I wasn't drinking (I wanted to remain sober for the night). So when my two friends finish their smoke and come back in, I told them that I just got a bunch of drinks from the girl(s) at the next table. \n We all get up and decide to thank them (the girls), which turned out to be just around the time they were leaving. Everyone shook hands etc, etc, etc. \n NOW THE WEIRD PART. The said girl shook my hand for a really long time. It was an incredibly akward handshake which lasted for about 10-12 seconds. She also moved her thumb back and forth on the back of my hand, while moving her other fingers in my in a circular motion in my palm, during the entire time of the handshake. I tried pulling away from the akward handshake, but she didn't quite let go until the 10-12 seconds were done. \n They leave. Friends and I go back to our table. I mentioned how the girl gives a really weird handshake, and my two friends look puzzled, and explained that she did not do the same to them. She gave them plain, quick, and ordinary handshakes. \n NOW MY QUESTION: What was she doing to me? Maybe she wanted to freak me out? Maybe she was feeling my skin? Or is there a meaning to this that I don't know? \n I just feel truly weird, and was wondering if this is a common thing, and if it means anything at all. \n Please advise.	Went out to bar with friends. Accidentally locked eyes with girl. Friends go out, girl gives me alcohol. Friends come in and thank her, she gives me weird handshake with her fingers moving in/ around my hand for 10-12 seconds. Don't know what such a thing is or means.	432	49	askwomenadvice
Me: 28/M \nHer: 21/F \n I just started dating this girl and it\u2019ll be about a month next week. \n From what I understand, she and her ex broke up for a variety of reason, but the main reason is due to distance. He moved a few states away because of work and she flew up to see him (June 2015). Shortly thereafter (or maybe up there? I\u2019m not sure of the timeline) they broke-up. \n We start talking September 2015, but lost contact almost immediately because she was in school and was busy. \n We reconnected December 2015 and then subsequently had our first date. \n It\u2019s still early enough in the dating process that we haven\u2019t really dove into our past relationships and exes. But she tells me that they\u2019re still friends. So much so that he sent her a package for Christmas. So much so that he flew down here to see her and they\u2019re both on a mini-roadtrip at a different city having went to the zoo and are having dinner at the moment. \n Now my question is, do I have any right to be uncomfortable with this? \n \n People can have totally platonic relationships with their exes \n Does me being jealous/insecure a confidence issue or is there some grounds here? \n Does the fact that he\u2019s out of state give her more of an excuse to \u201ckeep in touch\u201d? \n Should I even relay the fact that it makes me uncomfortable even though it\u2019s so early on in the dating courtship and she hasn\u2019t given me a reason to think otherwise? (e.g. She\u2019s not hiding the fact that they\u2019re hanging out, sent me snaps (not of him) as she\u2019s out, etc) \n \n Basically I\u2019m trying to find the balance of what is acceptable in the dating courtship and what I shouldn\u2019t stand for as someone who is confident with themselves and realizes that you can only be the best person you can be and the only thing you can control is yourself and your emotions and whatever else happens is out of your control. \n I perhaps should also mention that our dates have been going very well. They regularly last 4/5 hours. We kiss. We hold hands. We makeout. We talk. We text. We plan future events.

"So I (m29) have an 8 year friendship with my friend (f27) who in the past 2 years has been poly. She travels a lot so we don't get to hang so much but we write letters regularly and have phone conversations that easily last 3 hours almost once a week. We've helped each other through bad times and enjoyed good times. When we met she helped me out of my shell by encouraging me to talk to more women and even being a great wingwoman. One trait we both share is our independence. \nI saw her over the holidays and she blatantly asked me why I never asked her out. She's tall and gorgeous while I'm short and not too stout, which is why I think we hit it off so well because initially there wasn't any sexual attraction between us. Not that I'm not into tall women, I genuinely don't care about height, but at the time I figured she didn't see me like that and I just didn't bother and I was much more shy. \nAnyways, I told her I never did because I didn't want to risk our friendship. I'm not poly. I can do one night stands but that's because there are no feelings involved. She, on the other hand has multiple lovers literally across the country. \nSo since we last saw each other she has been referring to me as ""beau"", ""honey"", ""babe"", and a personal nickname she gave me which I enjoy. We've both expressed that we love each other and she just had the courage to be the first to suggest we express it further. I want to, but I'm afraid of developing deeper feelings, and the last thing I want to do is stifle her in any way. Is there any advice on how to proceed? We both feel we will become closer.

"SO [m 28] and I [f 26] had an argument about a week ago. Imo it was entirely unfounded and irrational on his part - he was mad about things in the past, and ended up calling me abusive names like cunt, bitch, and implying that I was a slut. I know I'm making him sound awful, but he's only ever like this when he's angry. \n Previous arguments, I'd say about 80% of the time I'm the one making the first move and starting a conversation - we can usually fix things, but he rarely apologizes.

"As a guy, I've been having some troubles with communication with my girlfriend. \n Personally, I feel like she asks too many questions of me. Whereas, I would prefer her to feel more comfortable being direct and making more statements at me. \n I almost feel like men and women often communicate from opposite perspectives- I've always felt more anxiety-ridden when asked questions like ""How was your day?"", ""Are you okay?"", ""What do you want for dinner?"", etc.... due to the open-endedness. \n But, in speaking with women, I've often been told that asking questions is something that women view as indicative of respect, care, etc. \n I tend not to ask as many questions because I don't want to bring up topics that would not be comfortable for the other person to talk about. So, I often have my own bias, where I expect her to communicate to me in ""my way"", where she could just make more statements- ""We need eggs and milk at the grocery store."" is a better form of communication to me than a longer conversation that consists of, say, ""Can you pick something up at the grocery store today?"" [Yes] ""Okay, I needed a couple of things- bread and milk. Can you get that for me?"" [Yes.] \n I know, rationally, that she only asks questions to show concern or thoughtfulness for me. (i.e. If I'm going to be busy with something like a huge work project, then I wouldn't be able to get groceries.) \n But, to me, it's more of a circuitious form of communcation. And, I feel like, perhaps due to the fact that I  suck  at multi-tasking, I subconciously feel more in a hurry and feel more anxious and stressed if verbal communication with others is more drawn out instead of ""cut to the chase"" or objective-oriented. \n All thoughts and advice are welcome!"

Man: 26 Woman: 27 \n I met this woman a few weeks ago, fell head over heels too quickly, too stupidly, and it hasn't worked out. I've been getting the silence from her for the past few days, and the writing's on the wall. \n That's fine. I am okay with that. If you play the game you have to be prepared to lose a few hands, I've rejected people, been rejected countless times, and in all likelihood will continue to reject/get rejected until I either find a partner or find my grave. \n But...

Just trust me, I try to walk in the footsteps of Leslie Knope, my gift giving idol. \n Now it's worth noting that I was not/am not expecting anything from this gift, I grew out of that line of thinking in my teenage years, okay, early twenties. A gift that you're expecting a return on is just a loan. That is not what I'm about. \n So, it seems that the socially acceptable protocol is to quietly fade into the shadows and put the gift in a closet or something, along with all my other regrets and clothes that don't fit.\nBut I still want her to have it, because I think it would bring her some joy. \n How do I give her the gift?

At school there's this guy that's in my class (around my age, maybe a bit older iirc). He started messaging me recently, it was all normal the first time but it quickly became all ''cutie'' and ''hottie'' and so on from him. I told him that I have a boyfriend (and I don't but.. you know) and he insisted that he could make me fall in love with him and a bunch of stuff like that. I wanted to be nice but still insisted that I wasn't interested, but he told me he'd still call me those words even though he'd actually asked me if they made me uncomfortable and I said yes. \n So then today the teacher made us team together randomly and I had to be with him, so we started working and he kept calling me those ''cutie'' and ''princess'' names, and I just tried to ignore him or answer sarcastically. Then he touched my hair and later my waist and I tried to laugh it off but really I was sort of uncomfortable with that. I sort of want to tell him to stop in a very serious way but I don't want him to tell other people because they'd probably think i'm hysterical and overreacting. Also because maybe I'm overreacting at it and he's really just playing around and I'm all mad over it. I've been sexually harassed before but I'm more certain that was actually sexual harassment because the guy was directly and bluntly telling me to have sex with him, whilst this guy is just insisting in a relationship.

So my mother has kind of had it rough. Youngest of 6 she grew up in SLC and was pretty much dirt poor. She got married to my dad, had my sister and I, and evaluate got divorced. She never went to college and had serious difficulty in the job world. There's a ton of shit we've gone through as a family I stuff I've seen her go through personally. It all basically culminated last year when I found out that after I had moved out (I'm the youngest) she had gone into a severe depression and had started to become agoraphobic. \n She was unable to leave her apartment without getting panic attacks. She was so far behind on rent that she was served an eviction noticed. Myself and my sister flew back home and packed what we could into a uhaul and I drove her back to her mother's (my grandmother's) house in another state. \n Since then, she has made some progress. She's not as fearful anymore but she has yet to find stable work. I feel really awful because I just feel like she has no momentum. I can't force her to do something but I would love to inspire her. \n I recently came across a photo online of a model striking a power pose and she looks just like my mom did in her early 20s.

"Hi there, \n I struggle with what to do between dates at first with women, so I am looking for advice on this. I'll give all the relevant details I can think of so that hopefully people might have some contextual advice for me. \n I have met a woman through a dating website and we went on our first date last night. I'm a male, in my 30s as is she. Had an amazing time, we spoke almost non-stop for two hours, then she had to go home as she was getting up early for work the next day (she had already warned me about this before we met). We didn't touch, other than a kiss on the cheek and a hug at both the beginning and the end; however, she was smiling the whole time, locked eyes with me, played with her hair, had open body language etc. I said I'd love to do it again, and she said me too. When I got home I sent her a text saying how much I'd enjoyed it and that we should grab a bite to eat next week. She replied saying how much she had enjoyed it too, and that I should definitely touch base next week. \n So, I know that I am prone to being nervous about stuffing things up at this early stage (I become much more confident after a few dates), and probably overthink things a lot. I don't want to play any games by artificially waiting before texting, or give her the idea that I'm not that interested, but I also don't want to come on too strong. The reason I am unsure is that I've seen a lot of advice saying that you should just forget about it and text when you have something to say. However, I know that she is super busy, working six days a week, and she told me how after work today she was driving down the coast. \n Given this context, and the fact she said ""touch base next week"", do you think I should wait until Monday before texting again to set up the second date? Or am I just totally overthinking it all?"

However, due to current events involving a break-up on her end, my thoughts for her have changed. \n Nevertheless, everything came to an head yesterday when she send me a text stating the following sentence that confuses me.  Essentially, it is a it's not you, it's me type of message but the one line in the very long text confuses me. I haven't even asked her about it yet because it's starting to become a meh type of thing on my end. \n However, I need help translating it into simpler terms so that I can understand it clearly.

"I work for a mid-size startup (over 100 people) on a team of about 10 people.  There is a conference in another city coming up in a few months, and my boss wants the whole team to go.  One of my coworkers pointed out that it will be a waste of company money for me to go because none of my clients will be attending.  He's probably right, but I didn't want to make a big deal out of it to my boss. \n We all started booking hotels for the conference yesterday and all of the hotels near the conference were booked.  The only one I could get was miles away and with traffic it will take a really long time for me to get to the conference.  Plus, I can't drive (long story, but everyone at my company knows this about me) so I will have to take cabs/Uber.  So considering the cost of the flight, hotels and Uber, the company would be paying thousands of dollars for me to go to a conference where I'll probably get nothing important done. \n My boss has started encouraging everyone to ""just book AirBnB"" close to the convention center.  I'm the only woman on the team, and I have to say, I feel really uncomfortable doing this.  I don't want to stay at a stranger's apartment, even though I know 99% of the time it's safe.  I don't need to stay at a five star hotel but I need to feel safe.  I've had a history of sexual assault (not something I'm going to tell everyone at work obviously) and a pretty bad anxiety disorder, and on a less dramatic note, I don't want to risk the Airbnb host canceling on me last minute and then being stuck with nowhere to stay, no car, and just stranded.  Plus, my boss told me there's  ""a chance"" the company may not fully reimburse me for cabs.  So basically there's a chance I'd be paying hundreds of dollars out of pocket (There is no public transportation option where I'll be staying). \n This whole thing is making me extremely anxious.  Everyone else on my team has lived in this city before (I've never been) and is very familiar with it.  Plus, they're all men.  They think the conference is, at worst, an inconvenience.  None of them know how anxious and scared I am about the whole thing.  My boss is a great person and I really like him, but I'm not sure he'd understand this. \n I want to explain my thoughts to my boss, but I don't want him to think I'm ""pulling the gender card"" or acting unhinged.  My main concern is just what a gigantic waste of money this will be for the company and possibly for me too.  Is there a way I can bring this up to him that doesn't make me look unreasonable?"

Good afternoon everyone, \n I (30/M) have a friend (30/F) I've known for just under a year. At present, she volunteers at an animal shelter and helps to socialize the animals while they await adoption, but has no formal employment otherwise. \n She has social anxiety that makes it difficult for her to interact with other people. She and I became friends because I was extremely patient with her and really did my best to interact on her terms. I brought her to a party earlier this year and did my best to introduce her to others. She had conversations in smaller groups (2-4), but was clearly uncomfortable in groups much larger than that, though she was a good sport about it. \n She has expressed a desire to look for a job and start earning some money. At present she does not have a car, meaning that she's stuck looking in places within walking distance. There are a handful, but it's not a downtown area or business district where there are lots to choose from. She is concerned about working with people, and from what I gather, her ability to answer standard interview questions with enough confidence to make an employer want to hire her is not one of her strong suits. \n On the one hand, I want to respect the fact that social anxiety is not at all easy to cope with, and that pushing her may well make her feel worse about the situation, rather than providing motivation to change it. \n On the other hand, if she wants a job, learning how to interact with people despite not being inherently comfortable with it is going to be a part of whatever job she gets, and most of those interactions won't be on her terms. \n I wouldn't be conflicted regarding how to help if it was me thinking, 'she needs to get a job', because that isn't my place to impose that. However, she's going on interviews with a massive amount of anxiety and ending up stuck in the same rut as the rejection from the companies declining to hire her puts her in a negative feedback loop. I do sincerely think she wants to make changes, but I'm not really sure how I can help without running the risk of making things even worse.	Friend has social anxiety, is looking for a job, isn't getting anywhere, I want to help. \n Thanks!	384	17	askwomenadvice

"I've been with my boyfriend (I'm 26, he's 23) for 9 or so months now. Recently I've just had this weird feeling and I can't help but think he's cheating with someone he works with. \n Let me say right off the bat that I do have some pretty serious anxiety issues, and on top of that 2016 has been a pretty awful year for me for a few different unrelated reasons. \n The first thing that made me anxious was a little while ago, maybe a month or two ago, I had purchased a box of condoms because I had forgotten a BC pill - we used one and then I went home/to work, etc. I came back to his apartment two days later and noticed there were only 10 in the box of 12. I didn't really know how to go about this so I just did nothing. \n Fast forward to current times. Sometimes he takes a while to text me back after he gets home from work, and hasn't been following his usual social media ""routine"" (i.e he logs on and stays pretty consistently online after he's done with work, lately he's nowhere to be seen - sometimes he's MIA for several hours and then tells me his phone died or he left it at work. I was at his apartment a few days ago and he was on Facebook while I was sitting next to him. He went to search for something and she was at the top of his search list - he typed what he was looking for in really quickly, as if to hide it. Her Facebook is pretty private, but I noticed it went from ""single"" to ""in a relationship"" publicly a few days ago, but now there's no relationship info to show. She also tagged him in some work status and then a few hours later it was gone. This morning, after getting ready for work, I went to lay down next to him while he was texting, and he immediately closed out of the text and put his phone down. \n I know I sound crazy and I know that I really need to see a doctor for my anxiety issues, I'm just having trouble. I'm about two seconds away from going through his texts just to either put my mind at ease or confirm my fears - he doesn't have a lock on it and leaves it unattended pretty frequently. \n The shittiest thing is, I would just end it because of my own issues, but I love him and I want it to work. It's not like he's pulling away from me, either. We have solid plans for different events, etc through November - not to say that we still couldn't break up, I just don't see how he could intend to carry on our relationship that long while cheating? \n What should I do?"

"Okay so this is kinda a long story. There is this girl in my class called ""J"", and I've known her and been friends with her for almost 6 years. We were pretty close friends, and we chat quite a bit in person and on whatsapp, about both school and just life in general. \n So a few months ago I realised that I had a crush on J. \n During the Christmas Holidays I asked her out on this lunch date. I dropped in some hints that it was a date like ""I was thinking it could just be the two of us"". She said yes. \n So during the lunch I told her that I like her, which went along the lines of: \n J: Can I ask you something? \n Me: Sure \n J: Do you still like X (my previous crush)? \n Me: lol no \n J: Who do you like? \n Me: I'm looking at her now \n J: Wait what seriously? \n Idk if she actually didn't know, but she acted like she had no idea that I liked her. After that I proceeded to ask her if she would like to be in a relationship (with me), and she said no, which was sad but I've had worse rejections so it's fine. Overall we had a really nice afternoon together. In fact, after that lunch we proceeded to go to the book store, walk by the seaside, and sit at a park (she had the option to leave, there were definitely times where it wouldn't have been awkward if she left but she chose to stay). \n Anyways, after that day I asked if she wanted to meet up again, but I felt that she was reluctant so I called it off. \n Recently I tried messaging her less since I am getting really busy with some work and I don't want seem too needy, but I noticed she is starting more conversations than she used to. In the past before I had a crush on her I would basically start 90% of the conversations, but now its close to 50%. \n However, the quality of the messages definitely declined. In the past we literally talked about anything, from bitching about people to complaining that the bus is late to just random life talk. Nowadays although she starts the conversations, its usually just her asking for a favour like borrowing my book or asking to see my work, and the occasional ""lol I'm late to school again"" every other day (both of us have a tendency of being late to school). The conversations we have nowadays don't last, and they aren't really the quality of the past."

I'm 20 years old, half way through college majoring in psychology. I've had 4 sexual partners, 2 of whom ended up being girlfriends (currently single). Although I've an okay amount of sex, I largely consider my sex life to be a nightmare and here's why: \n 1) Penis size: Flaccid, my penis is just smaller than a credit card, quite below average size, and pretty embarrassing. I've read a lot of posts and comments about how it doesn't matter as long as you maintain self confidence and learn to compensate with all the other things that happen in sex other than pure penetration. I've already done this, I've become very good at oral sex, I know what to do/say to make a women feel sexy and am no stranger to lady cum (bragging a little here sue me). Although I've never been asked, I'm totally open to using toys, I'm not going to let me ego get in the way of facts. If my penis can't satisfy a women, I feel no shame in getting some help. I've only had to change positions a couple of times, because (with that particular partners body) my penis size restricted me from achieving penetration. I don't ever feel the need to apologize for my size, so overall I think that I've overcome this pretty well, although the fact that it requires effort to overcome still makes it an obstacle in my mind. \n 2) Fetishes: I have sort of a hybrid fetish (2 fetishes that go together). I've had them as long as I can remember, even before I was old enough to get an erection I was drawn to these things in girls my age. the first, is feet. This one really doesn't bother me as much as it used to. With a combination of the internet and actual partners, strictly in my personal experience, about 90% of all women I've talked to/had opinions from either don't mind it or prefer it (for the free massages and other subtle perks). This one used to bother me, but I've only had one partner that was reluctant to indulge me, so I've been rather lucky in that respect. \n The second, is tickling. This one is tough to deal with. Not only is it more of a burden on my partner, but it's way less common and therefore way more stigmatized. For as long as I can remember I've been turned on by tickling and being tickled by attractive women. For a lot of people, tickling even in small doses in unpleasant, and tickling during sex especially is a mood killer. Lets be reminded of the definition of a fetish: A sexual obsession over a non-sexual body part, action, object, or scenario that is REQUIRED for climax. Meaning this isn't something I can just ignore, for me to achieve orgasm, I physically REQUIRE tickling. \n This post is already long enough so I'll wrap up. Putting all of these things together makes finding a partner who I can ACTUALLY have sex with a chore. I've had to ask a lot of the few partners I've had, and more often than not I'm dragging people out of their comfort zones, with makes sex even more awkward than it can already be. Not everything in life can be fixed, I may just be condemned to a life of very little sex. But if any women have ANY tips or insights that might help lead me to a half decent sex life, I'd love to read them. I want non-bias and non-sugarcoated opinions, thanks.

"I've been struggling with this for a few years now, and I'm finally at a point where I'm looking for some external input. Some context: as far as I can remember, I've always been attracted to both sexes. Gender and appearances are pretty arbitrary to me, personality mostly turns me on/off. \n So.. between the age 18-21, I've had 3 short relationships. After each break-up, I would often refuse to go out, and typically spend a few weeks getting my mind of of things while browsing the internet, instead of getting drunk in a bar with friends. I quickly discovered that I could meet tons of people online (all men) who would give me special attention and care whenever I was feeling sad / vulnerable. \n Plenty of times, the men where 5-20 years older then me and extremely kind online. Eventually I'd meet up with them (once I got tired of being indoors) and more often then not, all manner of unspeakable acts would follow. At first I was in conflict with myself about it: getting the attention was nice, it felt nice in the moment, but afterwards I felt disgusted when thinking about it. I hid it all from friends and family, and eventually, I would get into my last serious relationship and try my best to forget all about it. \n After the last breakup, however, I got depressed and let myself slide too much down the rabbit hole. I found myself actively baiting men into giving me attention and lusting over me. Between the age of 21-24 I had created a kink for emotionally abusive relationships (the very short, very intense, ends-in-tears type of deal). In 3 years time I had slept with hundreds of men (it shoots up fast when you're young / good looking / drunk and get taken to an packed orgy at 1am) and used alcohol as a way to not face reality. I managed to stay of of drugs and have protected sex for the most part, mostly because of fear for STD's and a sound understanding of statistics / addictions. \n At 25 I decided this had gone too far for too long, and I stopped the excessive drinking, I focused on finishing school (wonder why that took so long..) and getting my shit together. \n Fast forward to today. Single, good job, in good shape, most of my shit together (in a bag). I've had 2 girl crushes in the last few years, with mutual interest, but both times I felt I had to keep them distant. Apart from the normal scare of getting hurt, which is fine, I'm struggling more with the experiences I had and how to deal with them. ""What if it ever comes up?"" \n Part of me feels plain guilty for being attracted to someone ""normal"", given my experiences. I've always considered myself disgusting for what I've seen / done / had done to me, so I try to push it down and forget it ever happened. But then I get in the awkward position of sharing that I'm bisexual, and any follow-up questions turn into an emotional minefield, where I fear that saying to much will open the floodgates and ruin everything. Saying too little, I've noticed, comes across as me being awkwardly distant about it, and not willing to share details about a pretty big part of my life. \n I'm currently at a loss and looking for general insights / opinions or suggestions. \nI have a lesbian female friend whom I occasionally talk to about this stuff, but her advice is just plain terrible. And I quote: ""Drink more alcohol and die alone like the rest of us. Also get a bunch of cats. :3""\nSorry for the long post."

sorry if this is not appropriate to post here) \n I'm a 16 year old (cis) female. I've never fingered myself, never used any toys, and am a virgin with 0 sexual contact with another person. The only time I have ever inserted something inside me was once, and that was at age 14 when I used a tampon for the first time. Inserting and removing it was somewhat painful and uncomfortable and I am afraid of ever trying to finger myself or use a toy because I'm scared of the pain. \n Now, a couple years later, I want to finger myself or use a toy but I have no idea how to start, what to do, or what to use. I do masturbate but it does not involve any sort of penetration (I'm a bit shy to tell other people how I do it).	Never penetrated/fingered aside from a tampon, unsure how to masturbate. \n Do any of you have any tips or advice? Again, apologies if this is not appropriate here.	144	27	askwomenadvice
"Alright, so I [24M] reached out to a girl [21F] about 2 months ago. She was a friend of a friend and I figured, ""I'll just add her and try to message her, whats the worst thing that can happen?"" Went into it without thinking too much into it, (thats how it should be right? lol) Within that week she started reciprocating, in fact she started flirting with me first. We then started flirting with each other. I know this probably isn't common for her either because she isn't really outgoing or social. \n We come to learn that we had actually had a lot in common, things like her working literally less than a block from me. (We both were interns in NYC and had to commute to and from the same school! Our jobs and classes were even complimentary of each other. i.e she designed building interiors, where I design mechanical systems for them.) In a city as big as New York and commuting from out of state, having that in common was really an eye opener. We then started meeting up after work on some days and making the trip back to school for our classes. We would flirt occasionally in person too. This went on for maybe a month (seeing each other after work, texting, etc). \n Winter break rolls around and she suddenly stopped answering my texts... its been a little over 2 weeks now of no contact (I tried twice, and no response) and i want to wait till were back in school to reach out to her again and hopefully pick up from where we left off. Now I know a girl not answering twice is not good at all which is why I'm giving her space, but I always give up easily and this time I really don't want to unless I know for sure that its not going to work. If you were like this with someone, would you mind if they tried again after some time?"	Texted a girl who became mutually attracted to me then even started hanging out. Flirted back and forth for a month then really suddenly, cut contact. \nWhat do you ladies think? Thanks. \n edit: formatting.	334	34	askwomenadvice
throwaway because its a personal subject. \n I've been seeing someone and it's mostly just a friends with benefits thing. It's been about a month or two. We've been experimenting and having fun whatever. He's a really nice person and we get along. He's never done anything to break my trust with him in terms of sex. I honestly don't think he did anything wrong this time but I don't know. \n The other night we both drank some wine and started messing around. He brought out a buttplug at some point. I'm super kinky but anal is just...I hate it. I've tried it so many times and I don't like it. Not to mention all of the men I've been with don't seem to understand that it fucking hurts and is uncomfortable for me. It's like they think that I'll ease into and love it. \n I have always told him I don't like things around my butt. But I'm buzzed enough to say fuck it, I'll give it a shot. So okay buttplug and it feels fine. I actually forget its even there once we start having sex. The sex starts to get really good and he decides he wants to switch the buttplug for his dick. \n I don't know what I was thinking. It was just like okay and hes trying to put it in and it hurts even though hes using alot of lube. I say no stop it hurts. But just like every fucking time that I've tried to have anal with anyone he still tries to push it in a little more. \n I don't know but I started full on bawling and crying within 2 seconds. He stops instantly and queue me freaking out that I'm crying and him apologizing/getting worried. I wanted to finish having vaginal sex, so we do after I calm down. \n Anyway, here I am a few days later still trying to figure out why I freaked out so bad. I've never been raped but I think I have been taken advantage of more than once by other people. I've been wondering if maybe some of the other times I've actually had anal sex have been almost forced/not 100% consensual. \n There's been a few times with other dudes that convinced me to keep going even though I say it hurts. Or they just slow down and don't pull out despite saying it hurts. Maybe it's fucked me up and I didn't realize it. \n Has this ever happened to you? I am worried that I'm repressing emotions or I don't know. I've NEVER cried during sex, much less freaked out crying like that so suddenly. I'm worried that I need therapy, I really don't want to ever feel like that again.	I don't like anal but got buzzed enough to try it out again. Broke out in tears when he tried to put it in but not because of the pain. I've never been raped, I don't know why I started crying so hard.	457	43	askwomenadvice
Has anyone else have issues with their SO's mother being cold/distant? How did you handle it? \n Background : Currently in a relationship with an amazing guy. ( we are both 25). I love him tremendously and I feel like he is someone I easily might end up spending the rest of my life with. We are currently long distance (8 hours away) We met when he was vacationing with family where I live. We take turns driving to see each other. \n He had warned me early on that his mother has never been very friendly with girls he has dated and to not expect her to be super warm or make an effort to try to get to know me. When I have visited his parent's home she has always been home but mostly stays in her room. When she comes downstairs she leaves the room when I come into it. She has never so much as said hello to me and I have been at their home on several occasions. Over thanksgiving I stayed the weekend at his parents place. I live 3k away from family and worked that day and I arrived late at night. Apparently when my boyfriend asked if I could come stay (he recently had to temporarily move home due to a housemate bailing) she said ok but said it was weird that\nI was coming here and asked if I didn't have anywhere else to be. \n Over Christmas I drove up as well but we stayed at his grandparents house who were out of town and I didn't see her. I didn't feel comfortable crashing Christmas breakfast at her parents farm and we had a fun Christmas party with friends later that day. \n His dad and brother have met me and there hasn't been any issues. They are friendly and my boyfriend claims his dad is bothered by how his mom acts but doesn't want to hurt her feelings and get upset with her over it. My boyfriend has been very open with his family about his feelings towards me and our relationship and has made it clear that he loves me  and plans to have a future with me. \n Now I don't need her to become my best friend but it has become ridiculous that she still hasn't acknowledged me!! I have told my boyfriend that this really bothers me. He understands but says that she has always been this way towards girls he has dated even though she is generally a social person... has friends at work etc) She is a nurse so you would assume that she didn't have social anxiety and would have decent people skills. I told my boyfriend that eventually this is going to have to change. We both want to live together within a year and I don't feel comfortable with her coming to visit us or me coming to visit them and her pretending I don't exist for the rest of my life. He feels like there is nothing that can be said to her that will make her change and that we have to just accept it. \n I don't understand how someone could be this standoffish. My mother would never behave this way. I have dated people she doesn't really care for and she still spoke to them when they were in her home and acted polite. This women doesn't even know me to not like me! So ladies what should I do? Have you ever dealt with this? I know I can't force her to interact with me but it also makes me really uncomfortable and I would like to try to improve the situation.	boyfriend's mom refuses to acknowledge my existence.

Hi everyone! \n For context: I'm in my final year at University and we have a dance to celebrate our graduation at the end of the year. During my whole stay at Uni, I was very active in extracurriculars and barely had any time to date. \n Anyway-- to cut a long story short, I spotted a photo of a cute guy on my facebook newsfeed a couple of weeks ago and asked our mutual friends to set us up. I even jokingly asked them to set us up together for my dance, and the guy AGREED even before I met him. \n We met briefly for the first time last week and it was SUPER awkward (My fault, ugh. He did find me cute though, I think). I haven't done anything since then-- and that's because I don't know what to do! \n I have never asked to get set-up before and I probably did it on impulse (YOLO before university life ends? Haha!). When the guy agreed, I guess I was surprised and now I don't know what to do because I didn't think I'd end up in this position. \n My question is-- how do you guys think should I arrange for our next meeting? Should I ask my friends to set us up for dinner? Should I bring people with me? Should I tell him to go to my building in between his breaks so we can have lunch (we go to the same Uni)? I just feel kind of shy and vulnerable because I'm the one who asked for this and I've never done it before (not used to not knowing what to do since I'm generally a very busy girl). Although I don't like the guy (I don't even know him), I'm attracted to him and sort of worried that he'll think I'm boring or weird or desperate or whatever when I just really want to have fun. \n Would really appreciate any advice! Thank you so much!	Asked to get set-up with a guy (who agreed) and now I don't know what to do next because I've never done this before and that makes me nervous.	328	29	askwomenadvice
"I've been working at a pizza restaurant for about the last 10 months, and built a pretty good relationship with my boss. But he is very disrespectful to women, and does not like employees who are in relationships. I however, have been dating my girlfriend since May, and he has openly criticized me for staying with her after she moved 8 hours away as of August. So I was extremely excited when she came to visit me, and I asked for this Monday well in advance. Then she was able to stay an extra day, and I asked co workers if they could cover me tomorrow(Tuesday). Unfortunately, one of my co-workers told my boss I asked him to cover me, and my boss responded very impolitely. He text me a text saying ""Today is my birthday and I worked for you: if you get covered because your stupid chick is hear u will not work for me anymore."" If he had told me I wouldn't of even requested the day off. He did not let any of the employees know it was his birthday either, and I spoke to the manager who told me he wouldn't let him work if he'd been aware it was his birthday. He is a young business owner(31 yr's old) and I understand where he's coming from, but sometimes he has a temper and can be irrational. So, I have been considering finding a new job for some time, but this has pushed me to my breaking point.

Hi all, first time post and it's only a short one. I am just curious about something I discovered earlier. \n I am a 25 year old and have always used tampons. At the moment I am unemployed so I spent a lot of time at my computer. I mean practically the entire day. So I had a tampon in for somewhere around 6 hours. I shut off for the night and come up to bed. \n I go to change tampon and long story short, I find it is upside down/string-side 'up'. \n The reason for post is I am curious how in the hell that has happened. I didn't put it in like that since I use applicators, I would have noticed. Could it be to do with the way I sat/my posture?	Sat down all day, go to take out tampon and it's upside down.

I need some advice regarding how I should handle something that's really starting to bother me. I'm 28, 6'3, bearded and overweight. (Why I gave the extra stats will make sense further down) \n Every morning and evening I walk from my flat to my tram stop. This walk is a little odd as it takes me down a fairly poorly lit canal and under a couple of quite low bridges. Being a canal it's sunk below most of the surrounding area with hills either side making the route even more isolated. The fact it's winter and usually dark when I'm walking this route is also a factor. \n I've known for a while that sometimes people feel uncomfortable down on that route, due to women often looking over there shoulders several times when I'm walking the same route, taking their headphones out and clutching their bags etc. It really came to a head a couple of days ago, when I was walking a little bit faster then a women, went to pass her and she took off running while randomly looking back at me. This isn't all women on this route, but I walk it twice a day, 5 days a week, and this usually happens about once a week. (The person obviously being uncomfortable I mean, the sprinting away from me was a first) \n I've tried to take reasonable steps not to worry people. Making sure to keep a reasonable distance, only overtaking people when they're stopped or walking really slowly, but I think this makes my actions look overly deliberate and come off as even more creepy. \n I know the women involved are doing nothing wrong in being aware of their surroundings and the fact I'm a large guy walking down what is essentially a dark alley. But it's starting to get to me, as no one likes to scare people, and I always feel awful afterwards. \n Is there anything I can do to make myself less intimidating in this situation. I'm open to wearing a high vis vest or a bell at this point. \n And oh god, I read back my question and realised I sound like a sexual predator asking for tips to be more unassuming. AAAARGH!

Well, it's mostly me texting her because she doesn't reply most of the time or just sends one word replies. She says she is busy with work. But I am busy too! I still make time for her. But sometimes, we can speak for hours. She equally participates in the conversation. And at these moments, she shares stuff that really makes me feel that she is interested in me too! It's like, we connect! And sometimes it seems like she is not interested in me at all! \n She keeps giving me these mixed signals. I am so sick of this. I am not in the friendzone or anything.

I never interacted with girls much in high school and I decided that I wanted to change this right away. \n At lunch, I sat down at a table of 5 girls and we talked about where we're from, our intended majors, movies, and stuff like that. It went well and they laughed at my attempts at humor, but they seemed to want to talk amongst themselves (just girls), so I left them alone after lunch. Two of the girls in particular (Lily is one of them) were very friendly to me, but I thought they were just being polite. \n Later on, I did meet some more people, and at that point I figured that I wouldn't hear from any of the girls at the table again. \n The next day, I was sitting on a bench when all of the sudden I saw Lily walking over to me. I was surprised that she'd approach me given my awkwardness at the table yesterday, but she was smiling and initiated a conversation with me. We talked about animals (a common interest between us) and our plans for our majors and possible careers. \n Just before she left, I got the courage to ask if she wanted to exchange social media, and she said she doesn't have any but is going to create an account for the college's facebook group. We then said goodbye and that we hoped to see each other in August. Does it seem like Lily might be interested in me, or is she just being polite?"	Met girl at college orientation, talked to her and she seemed to enjoy conversation, wondering if she likes me or I'm just delusional.	310	23	askwomenadvice
"So I recently started this job that had me go to somewhere outside of Portland, OR. The original plan was I was going to go to OR, then NYC in July for a meet-up with other people in my industry. \n I thought ""Cool! I get to take some pictures in NYC and show all the neigh-sayers that I'm now going somewhere in life."" (I used to be a bum) \n Now the plan has changed. I got put on a few more extra big projects, which means A LOT more money. Like 6 figures a year big. However, I won't be able to return back home until Mid-August. Which sucks. Because by then, most of my friends will  move on with their life. \n On top of that, this is the MAIN issue. There's this girl I clicked REALLY well with, and was friends with for over 2 years. We were really close friends for a while. Then she kinda faded me out. My theory is because at the time, I wasn't going anywhere in life. She was a recovering addict and trying to get her life on the right track. Seeing I never gave her an actual reason to be mad at me, so she probably faded me out due to her needing more postive influences in her life, which I wasn't at the time. \n I was going to do one last attempt to try to reconnect, by posting pictures from NYC. She might be more inclined to reconnect with me if she sees that I'm actually trying to go places. Now thhat I can't go to NYC, she won't be able to see that I'm now actually working hard in life. \n I know it wasn't a 100% success rate. In fact, it was just a snow-balls chance. However, I don't wnat ot just let her go without at least making an attempt to show her. We had a strong connection from the day we first met, hence our friendship for a long time. I don't want her to just forget about me as this lazy bum. \n On top of that, I met ANOTHER cute girl shortly before I left. Which is RARE that I find a girl that I click with. So now that we barely know each other, I can't see her and she'll likely just move on to someone else. \n On top of that, my social life with other people was already shakey. Because I never was around. Now I definitely won't be able to be around because I'm going to be stuck all the way across the country. \n So I have two options: Don't go to New York, never be able to see this girl again at all, and be forever alone. However, I will be broke as shit. \n OR: Make really good money, become successful. However, no more social life. \n I might chose the ladder, because I'm 27 and not getting any younger. This lonliness is causing me to be bitter. I've been so bitter. I've even joined incel forums for moral support. I  just wish girls will just wait for me because I'm a nice guy. I'm tired of waiting for girls to come along because it takes forever for me to find a woman that I click with. I don't want to wait another 3 years. \n I'm so broken and don't know what to do. \n What do you suggest I do to rekindle it with the women if I can't be back until a month later?"

"There's a girl who is now an ex-friend (f, 27) of my (f, 28) partner's (m, 27) who has had it in for me since she first met me.

"I've been in a relationship for the past 8 months. Last year, I started hanging out with a new group of friends. I met one guy that I'm still really good friends with today, I'll call him Jay. \n I thought he was really cute when I met him, and it seemed like we had some chemistry and stuff in common, but I soon found out he had a girlfriend of 2 years so I backed off completely. I started dating his friend a few months later, I'll call him Adam. Me and Adam have been together ever since. \n I always kind of knew in the back of my mind that I might still be somewhat attracted to Jay, but I never entertained the thought. But lately I've been feeling the attraction really strong for some reason. It seems like we flirt but don't realize it. We're playfully mean to each other, and in general we just have a lot of fun together. He says I'm his partner in crime. If we're all hanging out and I'm about to go somewhere he'll say ""Nooo! Don't leave!"". I think he might be finding small excuses to touch me, but I could be reading into that too much. One time we were hanging out alone (because we were waiting on other friends that cancelled) and he kept making comments like ""People are gonna think we're dating"" and he'll try to list reasons why we wouldn't be good together while blushing and laughing. People have also confused us for a couple on several occasions. The other night he also confessed to me that he thinks I'm cute. I know that's a very low grade comment and could mean nothing, but still. \n I feel terrible about feeling this way. I don't want the attraction to grow but I also don't want to just stop hanging out with my friend. I don't even know if this is all in my head. I feel like a terrible girlfriend.

"I am infatuated with a woman (late 20's) at work who has recently moved into my department. I didn't know her previously. She's my type in every way and each new thing I learn about her makes me more interested. \n After knowing each other for only about a week, she singled me out and asked me to hang out. We've had enough small talk at work for me to know that she has a boyfriend. In fact, she brings him up frequently. She hasn't asked any other guys at work to hang out, single or taken, and every time we bump into each other for the first time in the day she says ""Hiiiiiii!"" and does his cute head nod/twist thing that seems very flirtatious to me. She makes direct eye contact with me when we speak, laughs a lot, and touches her neck or thighs. She also mentions that my behaviors or comments on things are cute. This has happened about five times in the two or three weeks we've known each other. We work close enough that I hear her interactions with other men and I've never heard her say something they do is cute. \n I'm confused because she constantly mentions her boyfriend and the things they do together, and has offered to try to set me up with one of her friends. She even mentioned once that she wouldn't mind if he asked her to marry him. Some of her behaviors say, ""I'm interested in you!"" and others say that she wants to point out that she's friendly, but has a boyfriend. \n Ladies, please help me understand her behavior."

"I go to a caf\xe9 on an open mic night every week, and I meet this girl, (L), there who was into me. She was small talking with me pretty maturely and all, and she was cute so we exchanged numbers somewhere in the middle. Soon after, I find out she's a freshman in high school and I immediately lose interest; I'm 19, and her being 13-14 years old immediately gave me the impression that she's pretty much a little girl. \n I have some friends that still go to High School, and one of them has told me that (L) goes to school with them, and that she  has been telling all her friends how excited she is that she got my number and was being completely boy obsessed about me. I asked my friend to try to convince (L) that I'm too old for her while she's in school because I didn't want to get the girl's hopes up, and I most certainly didn't want to have strange words spread about me ""dating"" a high school freshman girl. Unfortunately, this didn't work. \n I go to the caf\xe9 open mic the next week and she's there. Now I don't see a problem being friendly, so I say hi and occasionally talk to her while I'm talking to some friends, showing just the right amount of disinterest about having any relations with her. This wasn't bad at all at first, but then she started getting clingy with me as more people were leaving the caf\xe9. At some point she pretty much manipulates me into pulling me off to the side of the building just to one on one talk about utter nonsense, nothing that I care about. This girl is just running her mouth about school, friends, insecurities, whatever she can just to keep talking and hardly asking any questions, leaving me hardly no room just to excuse myself. I manage to get back to the caf\xe9, but this girl still wouldn't leave me alone, and I can't help but be polite and not just tell her off. I try sending these signals that I'm so disinterested, but she's either oblivious or she doesn't care! Towards the end of the night, she ditches her friends just to keep talking to me and at this point I'm so annoyed. \n Now, since then this girl is texting me, spamming me with snap chats, and even calling me! Yesterday she called me from a different number, and I pick up not knowing who it was, and I had to talk to this girl for 30 minutes before I had room to excuse myself. \n (L) is really nice, yet she's insecure as all hell, and immature, but I don't want to hurt her fragile ego telling her to just go away.

"I realize I'm super duper young. But I've never caught a break with dating. My first serious girlfriend at 16 convinced me to commit suicide. I failed and she left me. My second girlfriend, a year after the first one, turned out to be the ""treat me like a princess"" kind of girl who shamed me because I had severe depression at the time. My third relationship lasted for 2 years and we lived together for 14 months. This last one broke it off without reason and brought another man to our home a week later. And she said I was at fault because I wasn't supposed to catch her in the act. I used over 10 000 euros to provide for the both of us and she just left me. I believe the last thing she said to me was ""my boyfriend will kill you"". \n I am a troubled man. I am too kind, my sense of empathy is too strong and I'm not tough enough. This really is a serious problem. I can't live for myself, I find it easier to please others and experience happiness through their joy. I would do anything for others. I always put myself and my interests aside to comfort or please others. And in dating worlds, this is the recipe for a disaster. Don't women like men who would do anything for them? Men who would lay down their life for them? Every woman has said to me ""it's not me, it's you"" or ""I'm leaving you, because you are you"". \n I understand that a relationship is to be shared and both parties should keep the things that make them unique.

"Throwaway just because. Sorry for any mistakes, I'm trying to get my question across without using too much detail and keeping it as short as possible. All before going to work. \n Backstory. I've known...Sally...for about 4 years now. When I first met her, there was instant attraction, but nothing more than thinking ""damn she's cute, so I pushed that aside and quickly became real good friends with her. After that I never really saw her as more than a friend. \n Fast forward to this year, we're hanging out a lot more, going out to eat, watch movies, hike, binge watch dozens of shows etc. After all this, something switched on in my head, and I started liking her as more than a friend. Instead of keeping it to myself I told her as soon as the chance popped up (lots of things going on in both our lives, and we usually keep our hangouts as fun as possible to escape life). She told me at the moment she wasn't sure, still doing some soul searching of her own, so she couldn't give me an answer. Thats fine, I wasnt pushing for one, I knew she had a lot on her plate, I just needed to get that off my chest. \n FF to now (a couple months after confession) friendship has continued as normal, except that shes been closer physically (cuddling, massages, nothing sexual). Emotionally shes been a bit distant, this is from some new stuff that has happened in her family life since then, she's like me and shuts down when something is bothering her a lot. I'm still one of the closer people in her life though. \n My thing now, it's been a few months, I know she has a lot on her plates, and my feelings for her are real. It wasn't something that I got an idea for a few moments and then they went away, and I feel like they get stronger every time we hang out. The other day we were at one of our favorite restaurants, and I looked over at her phone to see what she was doing (we were both playing Pokemon Go and we look at each others phones anyway) and she was replying to some message on Tinder. I looked away and went back to my game but its been bothering me because she never gave me an answer. I know she would, and she knows that if she doesn't feel the same she can tell me and it wouldn't ruin anything. Am I right to feel a little hurt for that?

Me (27) and my gf (27) have been dating for almost two years, we never had any big fights, only minor arguments. \n Today she said she wanted to talk, so we met up on our lunch break.\nThat's when she told me, through tears, that she felt that we needed a break, that she didn't have the same feelings for me as before. \n I tried to ask what is bothering her, and told her that we can work on it together, and a break was unnecessary. She started saying that there are little negatives about me or my behavior that started to annoy her, and it started happening very recently. \n It hit me very hard, because I didn't feel anything was wrong. We were always finding new activities to do together, we were cooking each other breakfast, I started reading more books, got hired on a new exciting job, I was massaging her feet after a long day of work, we just recorded a couples video for her friends wedding which we were booking tickets for just the other week, and we always had great sex. \n When I asked her how long of a break she wanted and if she wanted to see other people she didn't know what to say. I again proposed to just work on our relationship, but she insisted that she needed a break. \n So I suggested taking a break of three weeks, and told her that I have no need in seeing other people. She then told me that she just needed her space and wanted to be alone, but she said that the break would do me good, and that I should go out and flirt with girls, and even if I sleep with one she wouldn't mind. \n This part really got me worried!\nDid she cheat on me and now she feels that I should sleep with someone during our break so she feels we are even?\nOr did she completely loose all feelings for me, and her way of dumping me easily is initiating a break? \n So we sat and chatted a little more.

Again, I got worried when I heard that, told her that I am not interested in other girls, and I have no problems with my confidence. \n We hugged and kissed some more, decided she would leave her stuff at my place until Sunday when we would meet again, and then I let her go home. \n It's almost 5am, and I can't sleep, my heart is beating like a drum.

I'm a university student and I've noticed this one girl (probably around my age) at the library has taken her things and moved elsewhere both times I sat anywhere near her. This happened twice. I know it's not a coincidence. The first time this happened, my peripheral vision just noticed this girl leaving when I sat down. No big deal, she probably had somewhere to go, right? Wrong! Mere minutes later, I went to get a book from the other side of the floor and I noticed she was at a different table. She clearly moved just to get away from me. The second time (today), it was the same thing. She didn't leave towards the stairs or elevators. I was not staring at her or watching her, just noticing her presence. Even if you're minding your own business, you tend to notice when someone leaves because of you in a quiet library. \n I have done nothing to her and I've never talked to her. The worst crime I could have possibly committed was glancing over at her. I wasn't even checking her out, though. It was just me walking to a table and noticing there was another human being at a table near mine and then glancing at that human being for half second. I wasn't sitting creepily close to her or directly behind her. All I've done was sit down at a table to get some work done, a table that just happened to be a few yards away from hers in a fairly crowded library. \n I don't understand and it's hurting my self-esteem. I doubt that I come off as really creepy; I'm well-dressed and have good hygiene, I don't wear fedoras, I'm short and scrawny so I'm not intimidating. I'm just some guy trying to mind his own business at the library. And the immediacy with which this girl tries to avoid me is so very obvious - I'm not exaggerating when I say the very second I dared sit down within a thirty foot radius of her today she hauled ass out of the general area. What is wrong with me? If I'm somehow coming off as the creepiest person on the planet and I don't know it, then I want to try and prevent that (it's bad enough that I'm socially inept as it is), but I literally can't think of a single thing I'm doing that would make me come off that way. And it's a public library at a public university, there are other guys sitting in her vicinity - it's me specifically she seems to want to get away from.

Me (30/m) and my wife (28/f) are having some trouble. We fight over very little things. Which I know is not about the thing we are talking about but a deeper rooted problem. But that is something I do not know how to address. Just always in lose/lose situations. If I disagree with her I\u2019m being a jerk, if I give in then I am just promoting that she is right. She tends to panic quickly and then I try to tell her to stop panicking it makes things worse. Apparently I\u2019m supposed to help solve the problem rather than say anything about her behavior towards the problem.\nWhen the small fights lead to the big fights, the central theme is she does way more for us than I do, I am not appreciative of the things she does for us. She wants me to be a man and take care of things. To me that is pretty vague and I\u2019m unsure what it means. She doesn\u2019t even know what it means. Whenever I ask her to clarify she says it defeats the purpose. Me being more proactive wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing. But I don\u2019t know what level makes sense. Do I get home from work, cook, clean the dishes, do laundry, take out the trash, scrub the floor, vacuum, etc?\nShe has a high level of affection that she needs. She always want to be scratched or massaged. She doesn\u2019t like me being away from her because we should be spending time together. I\u2019m fine with giving affection but it\u2019s like the level for which she requires has no ceiling. I\u2019m not against spending time with her, but I believe there is some self development time needed (reading, going to the gym) and she thinks that interferes with time with her.\nAs far as physical stuff goes, she is very insecure about her body. She doesn\u2019t like certain areas touched. She doesn\u2019t like me to see her body. She doesn\u2019t want me to see her in the shower or when she is getting changed. She doesn\u2019t like her body but doesn\u2019t do anything to change. Sex is pretty routine due to her being insecure about her body. So basically me doing most of the work and her laying there. I do my best to compliment her on her body but it has the adverse effect. She thinks that no one could possibly like what they see.

"Hi, I'm an older sister to twins. I'm nineteen, they're fourteen (a boy and girl). My sister has had a couple boyfriend's before and I'd feel like proud of her, want to talk to her all about it and give advice, and in general I'd just think awehh that's adorable she has a bf, she's growing up. Now my brother has his first girlfriend and I just feel totally weird about it. I feel kind of like I'm ""losing"" him, and it just makes me territorial and I was kinda rude toward his gf the couples times I've met her. I love both of my siblings equally, I don't know why these feelings are so much stronger towards my brother than her. I worry almost that it could be some sort of strange attraction I have towards my brother? (I don't think I am in any way, but I don't know why else the opposite sex thing would make a difference) I don't want to be that older sibling who interrogates their sibling's SO, I also don't want to be controlling of him or tell him he's not allowed dating or anything. How am I supposed to deal with this and why do you think I feel that way?"	I have a little brother and sister, same age. I love them equally but am super overprotective of brother.

Hello everyone, I hope you all are doing well. \n I am here to ask you people who have been in the same situation in which I am right now, and you ladies who can definitely help me out. \n There is this F21 I've known since I was 13 years old that literally invited herself over to spend a night with me. I am M22 years old now. \n We've been good friends but never too close nor too personnal, just regular highschool classmates. I know that she has some fetishes (She once showed me her closet - Filled with sexy Santa, Policewoman, and Housemaid costumes - at her place when she had invited me for lunch 3 or 4 months ago). \n I am not interested in any relationship right now, and it feels awkward to even consider having physical stuff with her... I mean, I've known her since we were kids! Tho I am into casual sex, but I am just afraid of the outcome. \n So, what do you think she wants from me right now? It may look like she's LITERALLY asking for it, but again please consider that we've known eachother for almost 9 years now. \n Thank you in advance,\nOuttaFun. \n PS: I think it is important to add that we live in a 98% islamic country, and that it is pretty unusual for a girl to spend the night at a guys'.

Good afternoon, ladies (or gents who feel like replying)\u2014 \n I thought I\u2019d solicit a little advice for us older guys on the much maligned topic of internet dating. \n I\u2019m probably not the only guy that\u2019s a little older (early 40s in my case) and looking for a younger wife.  I\u2019m sure most people read that and start thinking \u2018pervert!\u2019 or some other less than flattering terms, but I\u2019d honestly love to have children of my own someday.  (Let\u2019s just all agree to avoid the horrible pit-falls around discussions of fertility treatments, risks to mother and child, adoption, etc.  Those tend to be polarizing topics!) \n So . . . a few questions for you ladies\u2014 \n Around what age were you serious about settling down?  I\u2019ve been looking around the 30-36 age range.  Am I being too narrow by not including my search to ladies as young as  . . .  I dunno.  25?  When do you feel like you were mature enough to want something stable and long-term . . . and be able to commit to it?  Am I wrong to feel creepy if I email someone under 30? \n What kind of emails make you want to respond?  What advice would you give to gentlemen writing on dating sites?  Some obvious ones I\u2019d think would apply:  personalized (e.g.  not en-masse) emails; proper grammar; no dick-pics (when did that become a thing?!?); polite; show you\u2019ve read the profile, etc. \n Do you consider your posted age ranges firm?  Or general guidelines?  (e.g. is there a year or two window on either side you might consider?) \n How do you approach internet dating\u2014is it just a few emails and then you want to meet?  Do you try to have an email conversation for several days/weeks?  Do you prefer to just throw caution to the wind and meet someone after only one or two emails? \n Do you emails guys, or just sit around waiting on them to make the first move? \n Do you ladies see as many fake profiles/scammers as us guys do? \n For the purposes of the discussion, please assume the gentleman writing does not look like a troll, is not a whale and is in no danger of being harpooned at the beach, is educated, well-travelled, employed, professional, has no shirtless selfies, did not take a pic of themselves flexing or at the gym. \n What kind of advice would you have for guys like me? \n Be gentle!  ;) \n **Afterthought: Before I submit this, it occurs to me I ought to note that I have a response rate of around 3% over the last couple of years.

"So my wife thinks I'm cheating on her because she calls herself fat (I don't think so....She's not a twig but she isn't ""fat"" either..Just overweight) and unattractive and all that. \n I will admit first and foremost, I know I haven't done good with what I'm about to say but since we have been married (almost 2.5 years) we have had sex so few times we can count it on 2 hands, maybe even 1). We do have a 15 month old and he has always slept with us so he's pretty much in the middle of the bed with me and her on other side obviously. \n She thinks because of the lack of sex that I am cheating on her because I don't want her 'fat self' or anything. That's not the case....I'm usually just really tired around 10 pm-ish and my son has worn me out (and normally her too) so I don't know where this magical energy to have sex is supposed to come from but normally I just want to pass out. \n Me personally, I would PREFER to do the deed in the mornings or like earlier in the afternoon, not 10pm and such. Sometimes, yeah I won't mind if I'm not exhausted, but by the time she wants to do something at that time, I'm barely holding my eyes open. \n Also, I'm not very good at saying what I'm thinking...Like when I see her dress up or just look nice in something at any time, I THINK it in my head, but I never say anything and use the fancy adjectives...How could I maybe work myself up to start doing that kind of stuff without seeming like I'm trying to cover something up like 1 day just saying 'Oh wow honey you look so amazingly beatiful and sexy mmhmm'."

"Ok, so I recently got accepted into FSU as well as ended a relationship with a girl that lasted for about a year; it was an on-n-off. Told my friends that I was honestly worried that I was not going to find someone after this girl in particular because she was, as I can best describe it, a wolf in sheep's clothing. Essentially I've been told by multiple people that I am in an odd position of neither being an ""asshole"" or a ""nice guy"" and that I hover between the two... more towards the latter. To describe myself, I work hard and take care of myself mentally and physically, I do not drink because I have to maintain a certain weight for fighting. I do everything that I was raised to do by my parent i.e., be nice to everyone friends or not, hold doors open, be cordial with people and treat them how you'd expect to be treated. With this understanding, I don't let people walk over me and I have a backbone as its been pointed out and often I will bite my tongue in most situations because at the end of the day my philosophy is ""do you""; I believe honesty supersedes all else and will have no problem saying what needs to be said rather than what is expected to be said. All in all, I don't really care about people and their day to day problems because they do not effect me directly, I will help or go out of my way if its needed but I do not entangle myself with their problems because its not my problem.

My mom (F Mid60's) wants to take her out for a weekend trip but needs some ideas. It would have to be low energy and I think having something you do with nature or botanical gardens. \n To give an idea of the kinds of things I'm thinking, I suggested a weekend trip to the Northeast to watch the leaves change color but my mom will be out of town for the first few weeks of Oct. Also, since my mom would have to pay for it and we are in California, closer would be better but not necessary.

I'm a 24M that needs a women's perspective. I hated hs and anytime a blast from the past reminds me of it I have flashbacks of unresolved questions and I want things to change. success is coming towards me fast but I still feel depression behind, and I shouldn't. I have one semester til I graduate with a bs and an old FES came back to the states and she wanted to catch up with old friends. We might hang out next week and I thought all about high school and how I haven't had a date with a girl in forever even though it's just a friend date and she has a bf and we never tried anything in hs anyways. But I thought of all my relationships, the bad ones, the girls I really liked but never asked out, but this one girl in particular I'm curious about... \n We met in philosophy four years ago, fun class, and I asked if she wanted to study outside of class. We chatted over Skype but what was supposed to be study sessions instantly became her talking about her life story. She had a bad fb in high school, but she hasn't gotten over it even though she described how much of a sob he was for hours. \n So I went with it, supported her, accommodated her by validating her feelings and I felt she was somebody I could open up to. We went to the movies and she paid because it was my bday even though I said I could pay she really wanted to do it. \n It was fun and we exchanged gifts at the end of the semester (kind of cringy now that I think about it, but I didn't give it to her until she gave me her gift first). \n After our final, we said our goodbyes and we should hang out in the summer, she said sure, hugs and we talked about how fun the semester was. I was thinking about asking her out or at least go on a real date, but I hadn't told anyone I was going to do that. \n Next week I text asking how she was doing, no answer. Message her on Facebook, no answer and then she unfriends me. \n Now that it's four years later, I feel like I have a right to know why. Back then I just accepted that I was weird and that nobody liked me, but now I know I'm smart, funny, I'm decent looking, and I stand up for myself. I never knew I was allowed to. \n So I was wondering if it would be considered acceptable to ask her why she cut off communication to me? I just want to say lay it out and be honest, am I weird, am I ugly, did I do something wrong? I know this reeks of insecurity but I really want to know why. \n In the past I've done or said things I didn't know we're creepy as I was a shut in because of my parents and the stigma stuck around that I don't  understand the norm of society sometimes. \n Is it okay to ask why she did that?	girl gives me cold shoulder long time ago and I feel like I deserve to know why.

I realize that's what people typically say when they get caught, but I do believe he was being sincere. \n I'm not asking if I should leave him or stay with him, because I am going to stay for various personal reasons.

I'm a guy who is 23. And I have noticed over time that I consistently dominate conversations. Like, I will take over about 80% of them. Leaving the women I interact with a lot less room to talk about their lives, their days, their opinions, etc. \n I want to get better at this. I'm currently dating a woman that's more dominant and assertive. And she'll put me in my place. So, it's been a welcome change, I think. \n I've also sought out a new therapist and just had my first appointment with her. I hope to work on this with her. So, that way I can stop being such a toxic person. \n I never feel as though I maliciously intend it. But, I always seem to rely on women to vent to, for a shoulder to cry on, that sort of thing. I guess I've tended to view women as far more likely to be open-minded about me exhibiting vulnerabilities and emotions. I've almost never trusted men with them. At least, not nearly as much. \n I've driven friends away because of this exact demeanor. Where, some of the girls I've been friends with would just reach a breaking point with me and block me on Facebook or what have you. Because I relied on them too much as a place to go. And I wound up perplexed. Since, I felt like I had implied that I valued them as outlets to go to and that was something I didn't trust many people with. \n However, after I settled myself down, I realized how aggravating it must be to interact with someone that always seems want to talk about themselves and their own struggles/worries/etc. Without paying much attention to yours. \n I want to get better at this. And I've tried taking steps back and thinking twice before I go off on tangents about my own life. I want to be better at active listening. \n I don't delude myself into thinking I can completely change overnight. It's difficult to alter a mindset that's been drilled into me for 23 years. (Just watching movies, reading books, playing video games, etc... A vast majority of them are male-centric and revolve around the story of the male lead.

Background: known each other since highschool, dated briefly a couple years back, got back together almost exactly one year ago. So far it's been the most fulfilling, mutually respectful and joyous relationship I've ever had. \n Issue - While my partner is generally incredibly sympathetic and supportive, I've noticed in the past few months it seems as though I'm the more loving of the pair of us. I feel really petty saying this kind of stuff; like maybe I'm creating an issue where there isn't one. \n Things that I've noticed is that he basically never says 'I love you' first. This I understand a bit - it took him a lot longer to say it than it did for me. I appreciate he is quite reserved in saying it. It seems perhaps we weight the word differently; not much on an issue in itself. He'll reply in kind and without hesitation when I say it to him. \n But then I realised I also couldn't remember the last time we'd had sex where he instigated it. I think it was probably two to three months ago, and that is a pretty big behaviour change. I have tried to bring it up previously, and he chalks it up to moving out of the honeymoon phase of our relationship and into more of a routine. \n Perhaps I'm just in a bad mood, or trying to gaslight myself, but I decided to leave it and see how long it takes for him to text me first - just anything, 'hey babe, have a good day', or 'how was school?'. \n It's been nearly three days now. Not a word. \n I still can't help but feel terribly irrational when I type this all out. A part of me is wondering if perhaps I've been trying to shorehorn him into being more communicative than he wants/needs, or if I'm just overreacting.

Hey all,\nI'll keep this short. I met this guy on Badoo and we've been speaking for around 3-4 weeks now and i'm quite into him, we added each other on facebook & insta and I stopped using Badoo since speaking to him. He has a lot female followers & friends on facebook/insta and they all give him a lot of attention and by the looks of it he interacts with a lot of females on a daily basis. \n We went on our first date yesterday and spent most of the day together, in which he was regularly using his phone. I got suspicious and every now and then whenever I had the chance to do so without getting caught I opened up badoo on my phone to check when he was last online, and realised that he was logging in very frequently (roughly around an hour each time) talking to other girls whilst on a date with me! \n I also realised he logged back in after our date ended and was frequently on it after, again, talking to other women..\nIs this normal behaviour for a lot of men who use dating apps? Should I not worry about it and continue dating him?

First, here are reasons why I think i'm pregnant. If it maters i'm on the second week of BC (see #3) and my last period was the the 4th) : \n 1) One time I had sex like 6 times in one night and he came inside of me each time but we bought plan B but the next day. Then I woke up to bleeding on the top part of my underwear idk what thats from but if it matters I took plan B twice that week so I assumed it was from that. \n 2) I had sex with this one guy who I gave a condom to, he took it off and used the pull out method : no plan B. But the next morning I felt so sick, I had little sleep that week but I felt like my stomach was filled with water and I needed to throw up and I wasn't hungry all day. Today I felt back pain and cramps with the same not hungry and after I ate I feel like shit \n 3) I'm on birth control BUT I take it incorrectly. I used to have messed up periods, like one every year or two years and I got on it to be regular. One day I took one at 11am, one at 5pm and one at 11am. Last week I took it at 11am everyday like clockwork, just not this week.  They're POP if that helps \n I have no income, and I have a full ride to school so luckily I don't need to work.\nSo, what do I do when I have an income of 0 dollars per year and I don't want to have a child so abortion is my only choice?\nIts not the money aspect my dad will get mad about or i'm worried about - its telling him I'm worried about. I'm his only girl and the youngest of 4 so hes very protective of me, although i'm sure he knows im sexually active because my brother bought me condoms for a graduation gift (lmao). \n My dad is republican but he's not religious so he doesn't believe in pro-life, and especially with my college career ahead of me if I have the guts to tell him that would be the firs thing he suggests me to do. \n So how do I tell him? Is there anyway I can get a cheap (less than 200 ideally I can spend without telling him and when the credit card bill comes in blame it on clothes) abortion method without him knowing? \n I can't take a test for 8-11 days according to the online first response site, so I'm just going to have to live in anxiety until then.

Last Friday, I (23/M) asked one of my classmates (25/f) out for drinks. While she did not seem interested in dating, she did seem to want to hang out. Beforehand, I had planned that if she wasn't interested I would just ask her to hang out some time instead, but my insecurity reared its ugly head and I froze up instead. She then asked what I was doing in the evening, and I awkwardly mumbled something about having to doing readings and assignments for class and left. \n After I left, I realised that I may have accidentally given the impression that I did not want to be friends, which is definitely not the case. I can accept that people might not want to date me, but I really do enjoy talking with her and am hoping that I haven't potentially lost a friend because of my social awkwardness and lack of experience with dating in general. \n Is there anything in particular I should do? She started a conversation with me in class yesterday so I assume she doesn't think I'm some creep like I was afraid she would, but she seems more reserved when I talk to her.

Throw away for obvious reasons... \n I am completely obsessed with women's hair. I don't know if I would label it a fetish, but its very close to being one. I get a feeling of absolute fulfillment when I get my hands on a head of long luscious locks. I didn't really start exploring this obsession until my late teen years when I started dating. Over time I learned how to do different styles on various girlfriends and am now creating awesome hairdos. \n Now where it gets murky. My current girlfriend encourages this activity and thinks its cute. She has shown several friends pictures of different styles I have done, and now her friends are lining up to have their hair done. Dream come true right? Wrong. I get this weird feeling that I am being unethical by not disclosing that I am getting this fulfillment out of playing with their hair. Am I off base here?

Additionally, a month ago, we've got married, but she still in her house, as I got to manage thing to bring here where I live (abroad), there was no sufficient time as my leave was only 2 weeks, and things got really speedy so we didnt get along very much, and I returned back to my work, we gonna celebrate our marriage after 6 months. \n My problem is that she is very shy, (me too, but I'm trying so hard to overcome that), Ive tried to discuss many things, with her, but she is really the kind of person who will see your message, and wait for a time to give u a short answer without giving you much time to get along.

Hi everyone. \n I just wanted some perspective on my behavior to understand whether or not, from your perspectives, I was being sexist. It may seem minor to some however I think that it is important for a number of underlying reasons. I'm not looking for validation or anything, just clarification so as to be more mindful in the future. \n Basically, a girl on facebook posted a picture of herself driving, well to be more accurate, of her parked in her car in a parking lot looking a little hysterical or excited and leaning in close to her wheel. It was a funny picture. \n The comments from others were typical, either praising her or joking around. I made a joke asking who she hit this time? She posted a comment saying that sexist jokes would not be tolerated. I was at first quite baffled at her response and unsure if it was directed at me or not, so at least in my mind it was unexpected. I'm not sure of the sexist connotation so I asked for clarification and explained the basis of my joke (based on the above description of her picture). \n Someone else made a joke about her to slow down and she joked about being a speedster, so perhaps in my mind she was ok with these sorts of jokes? \n I've never made a sexist joke in my life and do find all sorts of sexism distasteful, and I do try to be sensitive around that topic, hence the main purpose of this post. My intention behind the joke was innocent, it was not directed at women in general or based on any sort of mysogynistic impulses, it was just a light-hearted reaction to her picture. \n At the same time though, she did interpret it that way so I don't want to invalidate her perspective or anything. I do understand that it's her wall and she can disallow anything she wants and that's fine. However, if one gets accused of sexism when it was not ones intention to be sexist, I would think that one would be allowed the space to clarify themselves. Is that reasonable? \n Anyways, she blocked/deleted me after I asked for clarification, so I was wondering if my joke and my reaction were uncalled for and deserving of censure. \n Thanks,	Made a joke on a girls picture (of her in her car) asking who she hit this time.

Hello wise women of Reddit. Male(30) here in need of an idea of a kind gesture I can extend to a female(30) who is having a rough time that I can only imagine will become increasingly difficult as mother's day approaches and she lost her mother not long ago(2 years?).\nWe've known each other 9 months and it's a platonic professional relationship. Her situation just gets me right in the feels since she is having a rough couple months and is a really great person.\nAny advice? I can't imagine a thing I could do... Maybe not bringing it up at all is better?\nAny help is appreciated :)	What do I do for a nice lady who is missing her mother? \n Edit: Thanks for the advice. I wasn't thinking so much in the gift area but just wether or not I should offer an ear. I've never lost someone this close so it's hard to imagine if that would be helpful. I'll just continue to be kind.\nThanks ladies!	109	61	askwomenadvice
"Bit of context, we're both teenagers working at a fast food place. One day she added me on fb and a couple weeks later I decided to message her in a subtle, friendly way, telling her stories/experiences of our workplace. As the message continued, the conversation was really one sided and it felt like an interview. She never asked questions about me. \n During our shifts together for the past 2 months she would do the following \n \n Sneak up behind me and poke me on the side of the ribs \n She also started sarcastically teasing me at times when I did something silly or make a mistake like drop stuff on the floor \n She made numerous playful 'excuses' to touch me on the arms (eg. wipe something such as sauce/flour from her arm onto mine) \n Numerous times during our most recent shift (day I asked her out) she would tell me how many minutes left before her shift finishes (Girls was this a major hint?, because I took it as her way of ""what the fuck, are you going to ask me out already!"") \n We somehow stood in each other's personal space while preparing food shoulder to shoulder, our arms remained touching next to each other \n I was actually planning to ask her out when her shift finishes in a quieter spot with no one around. She knew that I was going to as I kinda hinted, however she got distracted with something else and forgot to come back to me. I was thinking to myself, maybe that was her way of letting me down. \n When I came back home and checked fb she sent the following message ""Hey Name, really sorry I was in a rush after work My wifi isn't working so if you wanna chat just text me (her number)"" \n It would be a long time before I see her again so I texted her if she wanted to go on a movie date with me and she agreed and asked what time. I replied with a time and asked her on the pickup/meetup location. \n She didn't reply, so I decided to lay back a bit and to talk to her during one of our upcoming shifts \n At work (5 days since text with no reply) she told me an excuse of how her relatives are coming over from overseas and something along the lines ""how about ask me next time"". I think I responded with ""no worries, let me know when you're free"" \n \n I have never dated a girl before and I'm really worried due to my lack of experience that I could have completely misinterpreted my entire situation. \n To be honest, this experience has completely drained me mentally. However I really enjoyed the ego boost, I'm smiling more and feel more confident. I'll be happy to take this experience as part of my own learning curve. \n For some reason I have a gut feeling that shes leading me on, but my brain can't comprehend why any sort of decent person would do that. \n What do you think? Could I somehow left some red flags and scared her off. What should I do next? (I don't plan on doing anything, I want to give her some space. Also I feel like remaining passive due to school work starting to pile up and other commitments)"	"Girl was really flirty with me and she agreed to a date and she asked for the time.

Hello ladies! I am looking for opinions and suggestions for vibrators, dildos, and butt plugs. So far, my masturbation ritual only involves my fingers, and I would like to branch out from that. \n &nbsp; \n For vibrators, I guess I am looking for something with power. I like to flick the bean pretty hard, but I don't want to lose sensitivity either. I also don't want to break the bank. I want something that does the job, without feeling like I am putting a downpayment on a boyfriend lol \n &nbsp; \n For dildos, I would like something no smaller than 7 inches. Do balls at the end make a difference? How big is too big? Soft, jelly kind or other type? I think the biggest penis I've had IRL was 9 inches and that felt great (but it may have just been the guy). \n &nbsp; \n For the butt plug, I'd need a starter kit. I've never had anal sex before, but I have managed to get my fingers up in there (no more than two) Do you have any recommendations for a virgin asshole? Does lube matter? \n &nbsp; \n Any other suggestions are more than welcomed, please share with me what has worked for y'all and what hasn't. Would love to hear feedback before I make any purchases. \n &nbsp; \n Thanks in advance! \n &nbsp;	I want suggestions on vibrators, dildos, and butt plugs to purchase.	220	11	askwomenadvice
Hello women! I have quite an unusual issue at hand. I posted about 3 months ago that I had ended up in a FWB relationship, and asked for advice on what to feel about it. Well, I'm still in that very same relationship, and I don't mind it anymore, now that it has fully sunk in. \n This time my issue is about me and my [21F] FWB's sexlife. We met for the second time about 5 days ago, and I got back home today. During my trip I had sex with her about 7 times. Not even once did I reach orgasm. I told my sister's boyfriend about this issue today, and he told me that most guys would envy that ability, but it has really started eating away at my mind, because I can't enjoy it to the fullest extent, and neither can my partner because of it. Our longest session lasted 45 minutes, and I tried my absolute hardest to cum, but I just couldn't. I asked her for all I liked, a good long BJ, her being on top while we fuck, all that kinda stuff, but it is like there is some mental barrier that prevents me from going further. Eventually, I lost my erection, because I started to feel guilty for not being able to cum, no matter how hard I tried. At that point, my partner was completely exhausted and had already had about 4 orgasms. \n My question is ladies, why is this? Am I just like this by default or may it be something external? Also, what do you think I could do to reach an orgasm easier? \n (	I can't cum even after 45 minutes of sex, why is this and what should I try to do to have an easier time achieving orgasm?) \n ((Extra; if you have heard of any other cases like this, feel free to make the reference, because from what I can understand this is a very uncommon thing))	276	55	askwomenadvice

This has probably been asked a million times on reddit. So heres a million and one. \n Ill outline the situation. \n We had poor communication and it led to us drifting a little and eventually breaking up. We broke up pretty mutually and said we enjoyed the relationship but it just wasnt working out. One week later I poured my guts out and she said she wishes we could go back and redo certain things but thats just not the case. Then we didnt talk for about three more weeks. But at some point in those three weeks she saw me at the bars and texted me and we hung out for 20 minutes and chatted. She was very drunk and quite touchy feely. \n I was going to a party at her house (im friends with her brother, its not weird) so I texted her a week before letting her know id be stopping by to grab my stuff (clothes) and also to ask her if she was okay with me being at the party (I felt I should ask that). She was cool with it and we ended up chatting for a few hours when I picked up my stuff. Good chat, just about me and her and how life was going. \n Then the party came and I saw her, we didnt talk much but we ended up hooking up when we were both really drunk. The next day I texted her and she asked to make sure if we used condoms and whatnot. I was leaving to go on vacation a week later so before then I texted her asking if she wanted to come over for drinks, she was also going on vacation and said it was her last day to shop for it. I got the vibe though that she just didnt want to come. \n But the day after, she texted me something id find funny and we chatted, then she told me to have fun on vacation and I told her to have fun on her trip. \n Now I have a dilemma. I do want her back, but I dont know if I should just call or text her asking how her trip was, or if I should just let it go and give it more time. I always hear people saying to not be clingy and just let it happen. But that was why we broke up in the first place, because I was way too closed and didnt communicate properly. So I feel I should make the first move. \n Help plz	We broke up, I got shut down asking for her back, went no contact for a while. But now we chit chat every now and again (im not always the one starting conversations). I want her back but I dont know if I shoiuld make the first move.	427	48	askwomenadvice
I love my girlfriend been with her for 4 years and the time has finally come. \nUnfortunately I suck at planning and to be honest I see this as more of a bigger moment for her than for me so I'm not entirely too picky about how I do this. All I know is originally I wanted her friends to be around when i do this and selfishly I want to do it at the beach. The 2 things i love in this world, my girlfriend and the ocean. \n I'd love to have her friends there when i do it as well, but i called around to a few restaurants and to be honest I wouldn't be able to afford the expenses for a large party. \n Can you help me figure out how to do this? \n How can I get her to the beach without being obvious? \n Any ideas on how I can have her group of friends be there even though I can't afford dinner reservations at any restaurants on the beach? I was hoping her friends could record it. \n I don't mind it being just her and I, but how what would be a reason we go to the beach since she rarely goes? At least if we were meeting her friends up for dinner that would be easier to sell. \n Either way the go date is 8/8 so hopefully ill come up with something instead of dropping on one knee in her living room in our pj's lol. \n Thank you in advance. =]	Come from broken home, love/marriage wasn't acknowledged much.

Throwaway because this is embarrassing... \n I'm a friendly person. I don't like it when people are sad or uncomfortable (thank you, empathy), so I try to be as polite and nice as possible. \n Somehow I always end up in situations where I get hit on, somehow don't realize it because I don\u2019t expect/want it, unintentionally lead people on because they mistake my friendliness for being interest, and then feel bad when it's gone too far and I have to be very clear about my intentions. \n I didn\u2019t get hit on until college because I previously wasn\u2019t around people who would have been interested in me, so it kind of hit me hard all at once and because I was completely inexperienced with it, I obviously didn\u2019t know how to react. \n Because of these unfortunate experiences, I feel like I have to be \u201ccold\u201d to people to make sure they don\u2019t get the wrong idea, but I really hate doing that because I think it\u2019s rude. \n A side effect of this problem is that I have no guy friends because it seems every time I try to be friends with someone, they hit on me, I decline politely, and then they leave. :(	How can I be good friends with guys without leading them on?	202	12	askwomenadvice
Hey guys, \n I guess the title pretty much explains my quandary but here's some background to provide context. \n About three weeks ago my girlfriend (F28) broke up with me (M34). \n It was the second time we had tried at the relationship and although she kept professing her love and how she was committed to making it work this time, she abruptly broke up with me out of the blue stating that she could see how much I loved her and that I had not done anything wrong, it was just that she didn't feel as deeply for me as I did for her, and that she was worried she never would. \n She thus considered it best that we part: she wanted to find the instant, all-consuming love she reads about in her romance novels. She felt I would be treated better too. \n I was very hurt by this and felt betrayed, and we've not spoken since. However, I still love her very deeply and care for her still. \n Though I've cancelled all the plans and reservations I'd made for our celebration of her birthday, I am wondering if it's a bad idea if I messaged her to wish her a happy birthday. She knows how I feel about her, so I don't want this to come across as a thinly veiled ploy to reopen communication, which it isn't; she was just very important to me for a long time. \n Thanks	To message a recent ex on her birthday or not to message a recent ex on her birthday	240	18	askwomenadvice
My best friend (early 30s) is in a bit of an awkward dating situation with a girl (also early 30s) he's been seeing for 3 months now and he's coming to me for advice. I could use some help as I'm not sure I'm saying the right thing. Sorry it's a bit of a long one! \n The situation: \n \n He met up with an acquaintance  from  his old job to pick some stuff up he'd left behind. They clicked and decided to go for a drink.    \n In my eyes, this is when they started dating.  They were meeting up two or three times a week to do 'date' like activities. While out they would be holding hands and cuddling up together. She would text him or call him every minute they were apart. She kept telling him she finds him really attractive but she doesn't want to kiss him until they're 'officially dating'. Seemed to me they already were but okay, so I tell him to wait.      \n He says he'd like to be more than friends, she says she wants to think about it.  Nothing changes though, they continue as they have been for two more weeks.    \n She  meets up with him and agrees  that now they are 'officially dating' but not in a relationship.   \n They kiss, they have sex, they tell everyone they're dating . She meets his parents, he meets her friends, she comes over to stay a few times. I  really  like this girl. She's awesome and my friend is so happy!   \n A month later she says 'I prefer to just be friends , we had more fun as friends. I'm not ruling it out forever, but it's not what I want right now.'    \n He says he's sad but that he respects what she wants , he will try to go back to being just friends.   \n They've been 'just friends' for a week now.  In that time she hasn't stopped calling or texting. I told him to be less available to her and not reply as often as he would have originally. She got upset when he did that so now he's back to texting her all the time.   \n She's met up with him 5 days ago and got drunk , started cuddling up to him in the taxi home and asked him to come back to hers. Last night he went over to hers and she kissed him. This weekend he's going away to France with her.   \n \n Despite all this, she's telling him that they're not dating and they're 'just friends' and she doesn't want more than friends. She is making all the first moves here, but she's the one who 'doesn't want anything'. He is so into her that he hopes she will change her mind, he thinks because she said 'I haven't ruled it out forever' that he should wait it out a few months to see what she thinks. \n My advice to him:  Be 'just a friend' as that's what she wants. No cuddling, no kissing, no temper trantrums when someone doesn't text back immediately. I feel like she wants the benefits of a relationship without the label. \n What would your advice be? \n [	Friend dates a girl, she says she wants to go back to being friends, she's still acting like she's really into him. Should he wait it out or back off? ]	530	31	askwomenadvice

Okay so I just graduated high school and I invited this really beautiful girl to the prom. She said yes. The prom was great even though I can't dance to save my own life. Anyhow, one day, I tried to talk to her on fb chat; I said hello and no response. A few hours later I asked her if she was there, no response, everything looked bleak. Then hours later I get a message from her explaining how she was too busy packing and getting ready for a trip the very next day. I then said in one whole message that it was fine, that I just wanted to see if she wanted to hang-out next week and I finished it by asking her about what happened to her trip to Europe she had mentioned some time ago in class. She then responded in one whole message that she was only going to be gone for a week and that she would leave again for Europe in July. Now, I'm thinking that that last message that she sent me was her subliminally telling me the time frame where she's available. What do you think? I'm going to try to ask her out anyway and I'm thinking a movie would be good, question is: Which one? I'm thinking Poltergeist.

I know I have posted alot here I get it yell at me if you want, but you all have been very helpful and I appreciate it.\n I have my own issues and a girl I met before we were going into school helped me get to know the place and really wanted to become friends. She showed me around and was outgoing and which I mentioned I have some depression and slight Asperger's which makes things feel horrible so feeling good was easy because of her.  Okay she helps me out, socializes with me, supports me etc etc. \n Later on we grow as friends, I grew some feelings for her but never said it to her. I contacted her slightly too much (dont think harrasment or stalking, just thing slightly annoying) and it was offputting to her =/ Okay totally respectable, I didnt know, but she blocked me and wanted space. \nCurrently now, I am blocked on some things. First of all, you could have just told me to back off and I would have. Second she sets standards for people and she does not even follow them herself and is arrogant alot to me and others. We had our fights very rarely but I still like her for everything she has done and helped with. She says we are friends and always is smiling happy around me. I would not really be better without alot of her help. While I felt I was wrong, she is too alot of the time, if so, more than me. \n my point is that it is completely unfair to ditch her atm, but I also want to resolve things. She is so emotional and sometimes rude and a bit crazy, but I would like to maybe try to help her work at her own issues. I have backed off and feel right to work on my own issues and almost everyone I meet knows me as sweet, nice or well spoken/gentleman even with my own issues that I deal with and worry about, but outside stress and depression kill me often. It just does not feel right for working so hard to be normal and have someone great come to me and feel happy and have it all go to waste or lose it. \n I am sorry if I cannot explain myself well, just its confusing	Girl and I both have our own issues and arguments, but it would make me happy if I could see it through and resolve the problem and feel great again.	394	30	askwomenadvice

"Hey everyone. I have developed a little crush on this girl who I have worked with for the last couple of months. We work together on Friday and Saturdays. I dorkily asked her out last Saturday as we were walking to our cars if she ""wanted to get food"". I think I surprised her a little (and myself). She said she had plans already, but that we could ""get food"" another time since we work together. \n This probably sounds lame but we do snapchat a lot (I am her most snapped and vice versa). I guess I feel like that might mean something.. Maybe, haha... She also continued to snapchat me after me asking her out. We snapchat really late at night sometimes, but nothing weird, just funny things. I don't really snap much so I'm a little out of touch with it, haha. \n The two relationships that I have been in before were with girls online, so I guess I feel a bit awkward and don't know how to proceed. We don't work together this Saturday as we don't have work and Fridays we get off at different times. We work alone together on Saturdays, and I always look forward to it.. She is so fun. \n Do you all think it would be best to snapchat her and ask if she wanted to do something Saturday or Sunday, snapchat her early next week and see if she wanted to do something after work next Saturday, or something else?

Earlier, my Fiancee joked that she was sharing naked pictures of herself on her Tumblr. My reaction to this frankly surprised her. I said that this was definitely not OK, and I would be very upset and disappointed and seriously angry if she ever did such a thing.\nShe assumed my reaction to her joke would be to 'laugh' and not think of it twice. \n It turns out that  she has had the inclination to post some nudes online before , and she would have happily done it without ever assuming it was immoral or wrong. She never has, but she does not see any issue with it and would be totally fine with posting some, and wouldn't think twice. \n Her reasons for wanting to post them are  not  because she doesn't feel like she gets enough attention from me, or because I am not enough for her etc... \nHer reasoning for wanting to post them was that they are nice photos (she is very proud of them) (they are very hot), and she wants to share them with the world and contribute to the nudes online. She says it is not going against her promises that only I can have her, because it is just other people looking (not touching) and nobody would know who she is. \n I hate this idea. I felt a surge of  anger and jealousy  and wanted to shout at her. \nShe has always said that she wants to feel like I own her, and that I am the only man that can have her, who can touch her. But to me, posting such pictures online where the world can see them (especially while we are engaged) is the same as cheating. I hate the idea of other people seeing her naked. I feel like I should be the only man lucky enough to see her naked. I feel like these random people have done nothing to deserve such a treasure (I have put so much time and energy and love into her). I feel she would be devalued, and just another nude online, which people would appreciate for a few seconds, potentially masturbate to, and then scroll past. I feel like it's cheating. I feel like when she sends me nudes, they would feel devalued and worthless. Her body should not be in the public domain. \nHowever, I feel like these are reasons I have come up with myself to explain my reaction - and  I do not know the genuine reason for why I am against  her posting nudes online. \n She has since promised never to do such a thing because she does not want to hurt me, but she still cannot understand my reasoning (and neither can I). I asked her how she would feel if it was the other way around, and she shrugged and claimed she would not care if I posted pictures of myself naked online. \n Was I wrong to react in such a way? What should I have said? Why does she think this is OK? And how do others feel about this?  I'm still not even 100% sure of my logical reasons against such a thing.  Is it instinctive protectiveness? Is it me being a control freak? Or is it genuinely immoral for her to do such a thing? Am I overreacting? How would you react?! \n Yes, I know at the end of the day; her body her rules, but this isn't a good excuse for cheating, and in my eyes, this is a form of cheating to a certain extent. We are in a relationship, and she has promised herself to me. \n Thanks for reading. x	Fiancee doesn't see the problem with her sharing naked photos of herself online. I think it's a massive problem. Please help me understand who's in the right.	610	27	askwomenadvice
My husband and I are going out of town tomorrow evening for a few days. Yesterday I met with a girl who is going to pet sit for us at our home. I found her on the website dogvacay.com. She seemed very nice, and extremely concerned about taking good care of our dogs while we are gone. Nothing that she said gave me the idea that she would be untrustworthy. In fact, after she left I felt quite good about her staying at our home. Regardless, I am still concerned because my husband and I have had situations in the past where things have been stolen from our home by past roommates or their friends (we never figured out who stole the things) while we have been on vacation. \n I wanted to know if anyone had any tips on how to theft proof our house. We definitely don't have money to splurge on cameras or anything like that, but we do want to avoid having our things taken again because it has made us feel extremely violated in the past. \n I am paying her through the website so that I have proof of an agreement/transaction with her, and she did give me references from people she has pet sat for in the past.	I am having a new pet/house sitter stay at my house for the next few days, and need ideas about how to protect my things/ be able to tell if things are missing quickly in order to alert authorities.	213	39	needadvice
So I needed to retake one class to finish out my degree and my adviser says that any upper level course will suffice and that will be that. I picked a different course and finished it and now after everyone left for vacation the graduation committee tells me that the adviser never put in the substitution so I'm still missing the required course. At this point I learn that he can't be reached because he is out of the country. \n There is a work around though, the head of the dept can do the substitution, he is the only other person that can. He's out of the country as well but replies to my emails. He denies my request for the substitution on the grounds that the course I picked was not a valid substitution and in fact the course I need CANNOT be substituted. \n I inform him of what my adviser said and he replies that the substitution cannot be made regardless of what my adviser said. I've already stretched my loans out as long I could, I cannot do another semester or more likely a year as the class I need is only offered in the Spring semester. \n These two are the only two that can do the substitution and the committee needs the approval or my diploma will be denied.	My adviser gave bad advise and now I can't graduate.	223	10	needadvice
Images of suspension letter given today) \n Hello. \n Today I got suspended from Mcdonald's (UK) for taking a slice of cheese off a Big Mac that I had just cooked (after it has touched the meat) and giving it to a person on till who was waiting for a Big Mac no cheese grill for a long period of time, so in a state of panic and momentary lapse in concentration, I handed over the burger after taking the slice of cheese (an act that is done EVERY SINGLE DAY in the restaurant by employees) \n It turns out the customer was lactose intolerant and obviously came back to complain (rightfully so) as I endangered her safety. The only manager on shift came in and made me aware on my break and I admitted straight away informally, after a little more informal discussion; she said I would be OK (keeping my job-wise) but she had to contact the store manager to let him know what had gone on. \n An hour later I got invited into the office and got suspended (to my surprise, as it happened fairly quickly) and given the letter that you can click on above. \n This is the tricky part. My past disciplinary records are not good (please do not judge me as a person based on these disciplinaries, there are various reasons as to why I am the way I am with work). I am currently on my final written warning (there is so much behind this and as to why I still have it in my personal log) and I am not really a needed employee but yet have been working there since August 2010 part time (I'm at uni). \n My question is, do I have a leg to stand on regarding this issue or am I well and truly f***ed? \n If anyone requires anymore information that may help, please ask. I have tried to summarise as much as I can but there are lots of other minor details!

Here's the deal:Me and my 5 buddies are going to make a 7-8 hour trip to our holiday destination. \n The thing is that the car we are making the trip with, has space only for 5 people (max).

Help us figure out a game which will decide who is getting the free ticket (important thing is that the loser gets the free ticket)	115	25	needadvice
I like to read a lot and I have a lot of books, approximately one book shelf full. I will be staying overseas for one year and then moving back to the same area (Chicagoland) but necessarily a different apartment, since I won't be paying rent while I'm gone. \n However, I do not want to spend hundreds of dollars shipping books back and forth across the Atlantic, and I do not have room for them all in my suitcase. Everything (clothes, computer, etc.) I own fits in two suitcases, except the books. I may bring some books with me, but I definitely cannot bring all of them.

Hey guys, \n Basically, I have a trampoline in my backyard, and I learnt myself how to backflip, apparently with a horrid technique. So one day, I was happily jumping and I slipped on the jump before going to do a backflip, landed badly and hurt my neck and back, nothing severe, enough to cause some pain. So, a couple of months later, completely recovered, I go out back to keep jumping, and it turns out that I literally cannot backflip, I've been trying for the past week to no avail, I can never get my head underneath me, I know it's just a mental block, but I have no idea how to overcome it, some help please?

I have this old gold bracelet to sell I want to sell. It's 14k gold and weighs 1.35oz, or 38g for my metric friends. \n When I last calculated it's value based on gold prices, its value came to about $1600. The local jewelry and pawn shops are quoting me prices between $575-$625. \n I know they have overhead and need to make a profit, but this seems absurdly low. I was hoping I would be able to get $1000 out of it, or is this just out of the realm of possibility?	Where can I get the most money for a piece of gold jewelry?	91	13	needadvice
"dear people of reddit - my problem is multifaceted and i basically feel as though my entire friendship circle is fading away, and i am unsure how to fix my situation. \n my long-term boyfriend and I broke up about 6 months ago (had been going out since we were like 14, so six years.) My friendship group is mostly people we went to school with, so very interconnected. all my best friends are mutual friends with my ex. We have the same two best friends, and everyone seemed to be ok with us breaking up but slowly i feel like I see people a lot less - i don't get invited to anywhere near as many group social events as he does, but even when we were together that tended to be the case - i have a bit of social anxiety, i don't drink much, and i have been out of town for about 7 months out of the last 18 for my studies and because my parents live overseas. so, no parties, or invites to drinks or dinners or anything. \n just FYI, my ex and I don't fight at all, ended on good terms, have never been awkward or gotten weird in the few group situations when we have seen each other, and neither of us is dating anyone else yet. \n similarly, i think i have unintentionally neglected a lot of my female friendships, by being away and also by being ""that friend"" in a long term relationship. now that i am single again, i want to get back into the group with my girls and make it up to them, but i don't know where to begin. 90% of our group social interaction is going out and getting fucked up, and i just don't enjoy it. I also struggle to talk about things with a big group of girls - i'm quite out of the loop socially, so can't keep up on gossip, i don't watch TV, i don't really drink or take drugs and these feel like big points of difference sometimes. I don't really know what to say or when to be quiet and when to talk. \n I have tried a few times to message individual people and arrange to meet up, but i don't know how to escalate to a group social situation or a deeper friendship without being pushy or inviting myself along to things. some people were really happy to see me after my most recent trip away and others said they were but then meet ups never eventuated, so it's a mixed bag. \n I get really nervous really easily in social situations and so I think i need someone objective to read all these thoughts for me! \n I get so sad and jealous and upset when I see everybody hanging out together or see photos on Facebook, and I miss my friends a lot, but I also hate the feeling of being there and not fitting in. I don't know if I need to accept that my old friendship group is a part of my history and not my future, and move on with my life, and try to make new friends, or if I should work hard to reintegrate into the old group and hope I don't feel like the odd one out. \n PS I am going overseas in january for six months exchange and will probably stay overseas afterwards (I will have graduated university by then) if I don't feel like I have friends to come home to, so I need to know where I stand. I care about these people a lot but I am so scared to try and 'make a move' as it were."	because of travel and a recent break up, i have drifted away from my old social groups. even when i was in the group, i felt out of place or nervous. do i persist and try to get my old friends back or do i need to move on?	618	49	needadvice
This is my first post on Reddit, but I really want to know you opinion.\nI'm male, 24 years old, a rather successful student from germany, I look good and I'm usually popular amongst men and women. But when my friends and I go to a party, we drink a lot before entering the club. Everybody gets in a good mood, but my problem is that I become so horny when I see some girl in our group or some random girl in the club that I want to make out with her or take her home. It is hard for me to party without making out with some girls or at least trying to. \n \n Problem is that I appear as a slut and some of the girls I'm interested in when I'm sober are turned off by me. \n Girls become some kind of an object for me :( \n Sometimes I hurt the girls feelings or become too offensive \n \n This doesn't happen on every weekend but it annoys me. Yesterday I got a message from a girl who was very disappointed by me, because I was too offensive. \n One solution would be to drink no alcohol anymore. But I really enjoy drinking a glass of beer or wine occassionally.\nAnother solution would be to drink less and go partying without predrinking (This is normal amongst younger people here to save money).\nBut after I drink a couple of beer it's really hard to be reasonable and stop drinking.\nI would like to know if some other guys have experienced the same and have some tips for me.	Sometimes I drink too much and become a dickhead. \n I posted this in askreddit a few minutes ago because I didn't know where to put it.	267	26	needadvice
"So, I got a new job in Savannah, GA which is 5 hours from where I was living. I wanted to find a place with rent about on par with where I was before so I was looking in Craigslist roomshare. I was having a lot of trouble finding a place because every time I found somewhere I liked it was gone by the time I contacted the poster. To add to the trouble, I have a dog so I needed a dog friendly place. I found a guy and a girl who had a room that would be available August 1st. I didn't need to move in till August 15th and after talking with the girl over the phone, facebook befriending her and going down there and meeting with her I decided to take the place and just pay the full months rent to secure the place despite not moving in for a couple more weeks. \n Two weeks later I am supposed to move in on the 15th but my boyfriends grandfather passed away and the funeral was on the 16th so I went to that and ended up moving in the night of the 16th. I get there around 10:30 and they are having a party. Everyone is obnoxiously drunk but I don't care, I had a long day I am just going to set up my bed and go to sleep. My boyfriend who is helping me move goes into the kitchen to borrow scissors. The girl roommate hands him a pair and the boy roommate grabs it out of his hands and starts waving them at him saying ""I cut stuff all day"". It was really strange but my and the bf were just tired and didn't care so he grabbed the scissors back and we just holed ourselves up in the room for the rest of the night. The next day my female roommate is all apologies claiming that they normally don't party and everyone was really drunk so don't take anything seriously. My male roommate avoids eye contact and conversation. So that was my first impression. \n For the following week my male roommate proves to be an annoyance. Leave his TV on, keeps it on loud till late in the night, shaves and leaves his hairs all over the bathroom, smokes pot in his room (even though I told it was no smoking) and other random annoying roommate shit. Annoying but manageable.  Fast forward to this past Saturday. My female roommate is gone to her bf's house in SC for the weekend and my male roommate throws another party. I don't care I am just hanging out in my room watching movies anyways. Then around 10 PM I hear him yelling at a female party attendant telling her he ""will fuck this bitch up"" and ""i will fuckin kill you"". shortly after everyone leaves the party. \n suffice it to say my experience with the male roommate make me really uncomfortable so I want to leave. I found another place this afternoon and have already paid a deposit (that's how desperate I am to leave) for a September 1st move in. I signed no lease at my current place but I told the female roommate I would give her 30 days notice. She is still out of town and I don't want to tell the male roommate because I am worried he will steal my shit or something while I am at work (as far as I can tell he doesn't work). \n My question is: do you think I should pay rent for the month of September even though I am moving out September 1st?"	I found a place on craigslist that turned out to have a really sketchy house mate that makes me feel unsafe. i didn't sign a lease or anything so I want to just leave Sept. 1st even though I said I would give 30 days notice. Should I pay rent to them for Sept. even though I wont be there? How do I handle this?	610	65	needadvice
Hey Reddit! I\u2019ve been on this site not for about two years and absolutely love it. But I have never really felt the need to post anything. But after seeing some post\u2019s really helping people i decided to give this a shot. Sorry if its a bit lengthy but Its helping me to just get this out there. \n I am a 21 year old male living in New York. I recently graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology and a minor in writing and currently have no debt. I have a 3.6 GPA and much of my work experience has to do with customer service. When I was applying and entering University I was very ambitious and thought I knew exactly what I was doing. I loved psychology, helping people, and thought I had my life paved out for me. I thought that I was going to take my GRE\u2019s, apply to graduate schools, and train to be a clinical psychologist. Ultimately scoring me an easy job in a field I loved. I however, was sadly mistaken. As I made my way through junior year many thoughts of doubt began to come my way. I was beginning to lose focus and ambition and the major I once loved began to look a bit boring and something I didn't want to do. But I began to lie to myself and brush it off saying; \u201cI had a plan and i'm sticking to it!\u201d. Come senior year i\u2019m beginning to develop into a full blown panic mode. These thoughts that were once brushed off my shoulder began to become heavier than steel and I was no longer able to lift them off of my conscious. I began to realize that I had completely lost my vigor. Classes were boring, my ambition to take the GRE\u2019s and apply to school went out the window and I felt myself slipping. I started to become increasingly doubtful, worried, and scared about my future, thinking that I potentially wasted the past 4 years of my life on a major that I no longer had interest in. \n Now, almost four months after graduating I feel lost. When I first got out of school I was ambitious and started to apply to lots of places that had to do with customer service/human resources since my resume consists of a bachelors in psychology and many customer service jobs (Waiter, Host, Camp counselor, Ect). The only interview I was able to score was one at a Psychiatric center in NYC. But I did not get hired. But now I wake up every morning and struggle to even apply to anywhere. I am unmotivated because I am so confused on what to apply my degree towards. My degree is so broad and the majority of the jobs I have even applied to are ones that I am not passionate about or really want to do. Its just a place holder to make money. But even when i apply these jobs don't turn out well. So I am stuck. On one hand I want to just apply to every job just to get a job, but on the other hand I have just invested so much time and money into this degree and I want to make something out of it.\nSo /AskReddit has anyone been through a similar experience? How did it turn out for you? Any tips or things I should know?	Graduated with a bachelors in Psychology, Once was passionate about the major, but now have no interest in the field, and am very confused what job to find, or how to start a career.	572	34	needadvice
"So, this morning I pick up and drop my friend off at the airport, and during our conversation he mentions that she had told her boyfriend that I was gay.  I am not gay and I'm not upset about the context, but rather that she lied about me to her boyfriend to make our living situation ""okay"". \n A little back story, though, is that I let her live with me at my first apartment for 6 months (rent free, she was getting on her feet).  I let her sleep in my bed and I on the couch for the most part (we would fall asleep watching a movie after smoking or drinking sometimes).  Now, we've signed a lease for each of us to have our rooms - we moved in April to these new apartments. \n My Question:\nHow should I approach the subject?\nAt first I thought it was comical and that I would have fun with her lie and leave gay porn on the living room TV or ask them what animal they'd be, and then I'd say I'd be a 'bear' or stuff like that.  but the more I thought about it, the more it upset me and the more conversations I would have with myself (I'm not witty, so I have to practice conversations) on how the subject would be brought up.  I thought I would bring it up with him first and mention to him I wasn't gay and that I was trying to be honest about our living arrangement.  But I've also thought about shunning my roommate about her lying to myself and her boyfriend due to my anger of the situation. \n I'm not sure what to do and I try to be logical and mature about situations like this in order to avoid excess drama for myself. \n Note: And, with doubt on my next words, I should mention that I think, aside of this, she's the closest to perfection out of any girl I've ever met, and even though she's so close, I can't have her.  And it kills me.  I don't know if she knows about my feelings, though.  Probably knows I have some affinity towards her, but that's neither here nor there. \n Note 2: Our lease ends in November and I know I should find a new place, but don't necessarily have the finances for that now. \n Any help from her POV?  My POV?  Her bf's POV?  I don't care if they break up, but ultimately, I would love to have the chance to call her mine, so if there's an ending to this that ends with her and I as ""us"", I'd risk confronting or whatever for that."	My roommate told her bf I was gay (I'm not) and I don't know how to approach the subject. \n Apologies if this is the wrong place for this.  Redirect me if you could, please.	447	34	needadvice
Disclaimer: I tried to appropriately hide all personal information but please censor me if anything is not allowed. \n So this story starts a few years ago when I met [Cadence]( on an online forum and we hit it off. We have been talking ever since and even got to meet up in NYC for the [NEDA walk]( a few years ago. \n She is a pretty severe bulimic (13 years) and recovering heroin addict with many medical complications (gastroparesis, gastritis, ect). In and out of many treatment centers/hospitals over the years you might call her institutionalized. After going to the Center for Change she had a really good run of almost a year working, eating and generally thriving. \n She went out to the Eating Recovery Center in Denver where things really started to go downhill for her. Being confined to her room, threatened with involuntary tubing/feeding, being so doped up that she could barely speak, and then in the end being discharged for medical noncompliance. \n Since being home she had an [PEJ tube]( put in which she has used to varying degrees of success but mostly its been ineffective. She does not tolerate the feeds well and has a lot of pain regarding the tube itself. The medical team treating her has pulled the option of TPN[1] off the table because they think all the pain/feed intolerance is in her head. \n She has completely given up on herself and is considering hospice care at the moment. The medical system is seemingly fed up with her multifaceted case and no longer wants to approach other options. Her family is asking for advice on what to do and I don't really know what to tell them besides medical guardianship. \n All of her support system really feels that if she was to get the appropriate nutrition, medication and support she could pull out of this. However when the medical team has given up and the patient has given up what options do you really have?	Bulimic with severe medical complications. Medical system and patient have given up.

Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, it was the best option I could think of. \n Back story: girlfriend and I are moving out of our current apartment into a 10 year old townhome. \n We are suppose to move into the townhome tomorrow and we only got to do the walk through of the property today. The carpet is I'm assuming the original that was installed when built. It's destroyed, there are giant patches of torn up carpet, stains everywhere and it's wrinkling. There are holes in the walls and the plumbing is leaking, as well as a toilet that literally rocks if you sit on it. This townhome is not cheap and we were expecting all these issues to be fixed before we moved in. \n My question: we will be voicing our concerns of the current state of the place to the landlord tomorrow morning and we hope that he will have them fixed. Realistically though I don't see him doing that. If we decide that the townhome is in no condition for us to live in, do we have any legal backing to break our lease and have all of our money returned to us? We live in Colorado if that helps. I really hope Reddit can help us.	Walk through of place I'm moving into tomorrow revealed massive property damage leftover from previous tenant.

"Hey I'm writing this because I really don't know where else to go. I went to the cops and it really feels like nothing is getting accomplished.

I am really at a loss on how to go about this; partly because I think I might lack the creativity needed to pull this off, but mostly because I have serious trouble asking and/or accepting help from others even when I am in need. \n My stepfather has been battling neuroendocrine cancer since last September, and while he does not have an exact prognosis, everyone understands that his time remaining with us is very short. It happens that we share the trait of being unwilling to accept help from others, however after numerous attempts by friends and family to set up some sort of benefit party to support him, he has finally reluctantly agreed and there is now an event in the works for him set for the last weekend of April. \n It would mean the world for me to be able to attend, however I am unfortunately currently studying abroad in Europe, and do not have the financial means to get to the states and back. \n Our friends and family are already doing so much to support us emotionally and financially, raising donations for the benefit, and I would not feel right asking for assistance from them. Furthermore, I would really like for it to be a surprise to him and the rest of my family. \n So I\u2019m opening the floor to the most creative minds I know. Reddit, what can I do to\nbe able to travel back for a weekend to the states?  I am interested and thankful for any and all ideas you might have. Thank you!

I'll try to make this short and sweet \n I'm 20 years old and I've lived in Iowa my whole life. I can count the number of states I've been to on one hand.

To start, my car has about 180k miles on it. One day it started stalling because it couldn't idle. I took it to a local mechanic who told me I needed a new exhaust system installed for $1,500. He also ran a compression test and told me the motor was great. I paid him and it did not fix the problem, the car still stalled. \n I took the car to a different mechanic. They deduced that the problem was in fact the motor, and that I would basically need another motor, which would be another $2,000 that I could not afford.

I need a car, but have about 2k total left to my name, and my income is not good, and student loans.

First of all, I should mention that English is not my first language, so please be understanding. \n I recently graduated medical school and I was planning to start my training as a surgeon. My main concern is that I will not be able to follow a surgical career pathway. The same concern applies to sports. \n Two months ago I started experiencing lower back pain associated with bilateral toe paraesthesiae. A short course of naproxen and a vitamin B complex (10 days) showed no signs of improvement.

Tendency of L5 sacralisation.\n>   Discreet T2-weighted hyposignal of L4 and L5 (disc dehydration) \n>   Minimum circumferential L3 disc protrusion, marking the right L3 foramen\n>   Circumferential L4 disk bulging marking the dural sac medially and the L4 roots (right more than left) with tendency of fragmentary detachment of the right foramen\n>   Medial L5 focal protrusion marking the dural sac and the emerging roots of S1.\n> \n>  Conclusions*: onset of L3-L5 degenerative disk disease associated with constitutional stenosis of the lumbar canal. \n Also, I should mention that I had an accident earlier this year which resulted in knee cartilage injury. I underwent 2 knee surgeries, one of them being AMIC (Autologos Matrix-Induced Chondrogenesis). I recovered some of my knee functionality doing kinetotherapy, but it's not working that great and it further limits my activity. \n What will I still be able to do? What will I be looking at long term? \n Any advise or guidance would be greatly appreciated!

"Hi, I need some advice on what I should do. I'm a highschool student who has had all of the files on my USB stick wiped for apparently no reason at all. A little backstory: \n I've been playing a computer game at lunch called ""Race the Sun"" with my friend, which is by all means rated E (no violence, you just try to fly as far as possible,  Link . Everything was ok until later today, when I was doing work and compulsively saving my document to my USB stick (Yes, every change requires a CTRL-S), when it threw me an error saying the document no longer existed. So that's a little weird. Well I go to check it out and notice that ALL of my files in my USB stick have been cleaned out, besides a few of the files for grub and installing ubuntu in the top folder. \n I can tell the stick was not corrupted because the folder I was saving my project into still existed, the few remaining files are still completely fine and intact, and normally when deleting something it stops you if a file or process is running from the folder that's trying to be deleted. What puzzles (and to be quite honest, infuriates) me is that only a few files required to run grub have been deleted, completely preventing me from accessing the GNU interface on my laptop when I need to boot it up from my USB stick. Deleted files include a few months worth of mods and coding for games I've been making, a few games I play (I've payed for them) and lots, and lots, of schoolwork. Also something that should be noted is that my friend is missing his files for Race The Sun, but the rest of his USB seems to be untouched. \n I'll be talking to our IT tomorrow to let him know he could have just asked me to remove the game, as I have absolutely no problem doing it. I didn't have anything illegal on the USB, no pirated music or movies, only school projects, some games I play in my spare time, and lots of code. As far as I'm concerned, they're invading my privacy and essentially destroying months of work (including study notes!!!) that I will need for school, that can now not be recovered. As for me, I have learned my lesson to encrypt my USB stick and all files included, BACK THEM UP, because now I can not trust the school with my work, including work that I've done outside of school. \n So with all that said, is there anything I need to make sure I do or say to the IT, or anywhere I can talk to someone to at least be compensated for everything I have lost? This incident has put me in quite an off mood, as now I'll have to be redoing quite a few projects that I really don't have the time to catch back up on. Thanks for any help."

"Hey Guys, I'd appreciate advice on whether I should withdraw from a class (Calculus III). The withdrawal deadline is this Friday and I have been in a dilemma, part of me feels withdrawing is giving up and wasting money, while the other is just a bad gut feeling that I'll get a D. My school allows up to 3 withdraws, which means getting a ""W"" for the course on the transcript which doesn't affect GPA, but counts toward the # of attempted credits. I have already used one in the past, which was for a CS class due to my father being hospitalized for awhile. I retook it and did well. I'm a Junior CS major, I don't need Calc III as a prerequisite for any classes, however I must take it. I did a Co-Op/Internship as a software engineer for a semester, so that means I will have to graduate a semester later, withdrawing this class will either extend that or force me to clump Calc III into next semester which will all be 300/400 level CS courses (ouch). Withdrawing will also leave me at 4 classes rather than 5, 15 credits to 12 in this case. I got an 82% on my first midterm, and anywhere from a 20-50% on my second midterm, now all I have left is quiz/homework grade and the final exam. I emailed my professor and he said he will try to grade my exam back ASAP, but can't make any promises. I'd have to withdraw before the deadline. This guy doesn't curve, give much partial credit, and no exams are dropped."	Got an 82% on 1st exam, fucked up 2nd exam/midterm probably 20-50% (Depending on partial credit).

"My brother (29) has always been a bit strange growing up, and had difficulties socially and with school. He was almost able to finish college, but couldn't due to problems with writing and verbal communication. Since then, he hasn't had a job (and has never held more than a temporary position), and either fails interviews, or fails to deliver, and thus loses the job. \n My sister (40) has recently tried to help him get on his feet. Long story short, she had him see a therapist who confirmed what others in my brother's life has told him-- he was Asperger's, and particularly has difficulty with executive function, which is largely why he seems unable to cope on his own. \n My parents are in denial about the diagnosis, and say he's ""normal"" and ""just needs to a get a job"". My parents are old, retired, and could honestly keel over any day now. They think my sister is a crackpot, and doing more harm than good. They think my brother just needs to get a job and everything will be fine (ie they don't have to give a shit anymore and can just enjoy their retirement). My parents don't want him to go to therapy, support groups, or even read up about any of this. \n Currently, my brother is just living in my parent's basement, with no social contact (which I believe contributes to his depression, although this has not been formally diagnosed; my parents are in denial about as well), no income, no hopes. My sister wants to see if we can get him on some kind disability, or some support program for disabled people, but my parents are creating every kind of road block possible. Oh and my parents have half a foot out the door (a second home in Florida), to which I suspect they'll fully move to within a year or two and abandon my brother. (They probably assume my sister will just take him in, and she's barely financially stable as well with 2 cancers in her family, but that's another story entirely). \n So Reddit, what can I do to help and ensure that my brother isn't homeless in the next few years? I should note, I (26) am financially barely on my feet, with not much to spare, and I live on the other side of the country currently due to schooling."

Okay, so let me fill you in to how I got here. Started freshman semester of college, decided to commute, commuting got lonely, I was already depressed from Highschool bullies putting me down and had already isolated myself because of that. \n But commuting made my loner-ness feel a lot more intense especially since I met some awesome people but they never wanted to hang out with, I could only assume it was because I commuted and didn't live on campus. \n So I get a job to save up for my own car, shit happens, I get fired from my job that only paid minimum wage anyways ( $300 a month), depression sinks in and I'm doing terrible and school, and I end up having to withdraw from semester costing me $2000 to the school. \n I spend the next year and two months scrambling around with different jobs and looking at other colleges to go to. Shit had happened again, and I fear I may be fired from this job as well. \n Now I have been getting myself prepared to join coast guard, and I've already talked to a recruiter, I just have to lose 20 lbs first. \n But I was thinking about my future in the military, and I realized there may be some things I'll have to sacrifice to uphold the military image. I have certain hobbies that don't the military might improve of.( I like the street racing scene, tatoos, drug,\nspirituality). \n Now I'd have money to do that stuff, if I were in the military, but I'm 19. I spent the last 4-6 years depressed, and I'm just beginning to explore myself in my youth. I feel like in the military, I'll mentally become a thirty old man. \n Now one thing that edged me towards military is money, independence, and lack of debt. \n But I forgot my parents would let me stay with them while I'll pay my debts off, I was just focusing on getting a car, which I why i needed money in the very first place. But now that my anxiety has decreased I wouldn't mind living on campus too much. \n And I could get a student part time job for money towards my other hobbies, and most importantly explore myself some more and have other people in my life to do some exploring with.	Should I join the military and do my own thing while becoming really mature and well established, or stay the college route and enjoy my youth some more ?	391	29	needadvice
Roommate was involved in a 4 car collision at the beginning of Oct. which apparently royally screwed up his back and cervical collar. The ER doc that day just handed him a bunch of scripts and sent him on his way. He went back to work, in pain, but figured that was what he was supposed to do. He works with heavy machinery and lugs heavy materials around all the time. One item even caused and audible 'pop' and dropped him to his knees in the middle of the shop. He went back to the hospital, where the new doc ran more tests, and said he should have never gone back to work so soon after the accident, and told him he need physical therapy. His job wanted a doctors note, and the doctor insisted he say out of work for half a week. He went into work, explained everything and gave them a copy of the doctors note. He went home thinking everything was good. He returned to work after the restriction had been lifted, but they have been acting odd. Today everything boiled over, they are threatening to fire him and stated that he never gave them a doctors note. What rights and recourse does he have at this point?

I live in San Francisco, where there are VERY specific conditions that need to be met in order to remove someone from a sublease. It\u2019s tragic, because I have a pretty crappy person living with me. \n Since I can\u2019t legally kick her out, I need to find some way to manage her. Because she is pretty bad.\nToday she informed me that she will not be paying for the house cleaning service. This is a service that SHE suggested. I estimated it would be about $50/mo split three ways. I hired a house cleaner, and nightmare roommate said she couldn't tell the place had been cleaned. Mind you, this is a woman who keeps rotting food in her room. In fact, she\u2019s so bad at cleaning her dishes (she will leave them in the sink for WEEKS at a time) that I told her she\u2019s no longer allowed to use my dishes, and she still managed to leave her one pan in the sink for more than two weeks after that. So she\u2019s a slob, critiquing the ability of a professional to clean. \n The next month I personally cleaned the apartment. I spent seven hours DEEP cleaning. I was raised a military brat, so I know how to seriously clean. I charged the apartment for my time, but only minimum wage ($72). I make several times that in my day job. She doesn't know I was the one who cleaned for February, but still she has decided to deduct cleaning services from the bills owed for the month, PLUS the difference between January\u2019s cleaning service and the $50 she thinks she should pay. \n Legally there\u2019s not much I can do about this. I can take her to small claims, but that would be a huge hassle and pretty expensive to boot. So I\u2019m asking for help on how to deal with her. As I mentioned, I already took away her permission to use my dishes. What else can I do in light of the fact that she refuses to clean and refuses to pay for a cleaner? \n Any other (legal) recommendations for getting her to move out?	I have a slob roommate who refuses to clean or pay for cleaning services. How do I impose penalties on her for not contributing to the cleanliness of the common areas? Bonus: how do I get her to move out since I can\u2019t kick her out?	357	46	needadvice

"I tried posting this in AskRedit which a bot informed me was an oops so I'll try here. \nOk so need some advice from a neutral perspective. During the meeting all of the staff seemed a bit defensive which I understand. I wasn't exactly saying ya'll aren't doing your jobs but what I did say several times was that my point was this: Sending her home obviously doesn't work to change her behavior. If this school isn't capable of handling her and keeping her at school, we need to look at where she should be if not this school. I told them I understand it's frustrating when her behavior impedes other's learning, but once again: if they do not have/can't provide the things she needs to keep her at school we need to look at other options. Homeschool/homebound is not adequate in my opinion. They kept saying she's getting what everyone else gets, she's not the only one on half days, etc. I said bottom line- Free Appropriate Public Education means she need to be progressing. She is not progressing with the program you're providing. This child is being left behind. The school psych (who was kinda rude and uppity the whole meeting) said to me ""Well you do realize she's disabled and so is going to be behind"" (In my opinion with a shitty bug eyed expression and snotty tone) Am I being oversensitive because it seems to me that was rude and uncalled for. My response was ""I am more aware that my child has a disability than anyone at this table. Her disability doesn't mean it's ok for her to be behind"" Also didn't say it but was thinking- esp when she has NO learning disability! Her intelligence is normal. Other facts that may be relevant: My daughter is 10 in 3rd grade and has a diagnosis of Autism/ADHD/ and bipolar disorder. Her intelligence is fine her issues are social and behavior. The school's response to her bad behavior to avoid work is to put her on less school time or have me pick her up."	"During the IEP meeting when I expressed concern my child was being left behind school psych said ""Well she IS disabled she's going to be behind"" in a ""duh"" kinda way.

I'm sorry if this is not the right subreddit, but I would appreciate any help before I relapse and spiral into oblivion, disconnecting myself into reality. \n I'm at the point in my life where things didn't pan out as planned: I initially was in a program for four years in Mathematics, with a specialization in accounting and some finance courses. My GPA suffered and never did recover very much with a failed course in each semester as a result from plummeting into severe clinical depression. This stemmed from failing my core introductory accounting course in first year and having mediocre grades (B+ to A-) in my other courses. \n I was forced to withdraw from this program in my last year, because my GPA did not satisfy the cutoff. I may have been delusional at the time, but I transferred to another degree with the same university because I had taken some electives in my prior program, and I had done fairly well in my probationary term required for transferring between faculties. \n Fast forward to almost two years of coursework, and I was close to getting an Honours Economics degree. However, in order to be considered for additional accounting courses needed for satisfying CPA designation requirements, I forced myself to supplement accounting courses prior to graduation and took a six course load prior to graduating (I'm a dumbass). The pressure was immense and I ended up graduating with a general economics degree with a 73% cumulative average and 76% economics major average). \n Current situation:  I have heavily invested into accounting, which might not be something that I like but something that I need to support myself. I have prior work experience at accounting firms aggregately for years in entry-level positions, and worked a similar full-time position for six months as an excellent employee before being let go by a power-tripping, racist, sexist, egocentric maniac of an (really toxic) employer because the firm had too many employees and too little work (official reason). \n I've been applying to as many firms and organizations (i.e. hospitals, banks), but I haven't secured any full-time offers with the few interviews I've had. \n It's come to the point in figuring out what I should be doing. Should I pursue a second bachelor's degree in the hopes that it'll get me enough marks to pursue graduate school? Should I pursue graduate school (if it's even possible with my general economics degree?) Should I pursue designations that don't require marks, like the CFA? \n I've been actively applying to jobs. I've been going to the gym to keep my sanity intact, and to recover my quality of health that battling with depression put me through. I've also purchased books that will prepare me for the GMAT, LSAT, and the CFA, and the CPA designation with self-study hopefully doors might remain open if I ace the entrance exams.	I'm 25, difficult finding work despite having work experience, graduated with a lousy degree and subpar GPA due to battling with depression since first year which has limited my graduate degree choices.

I am one of three who is supposed to be going (i think). I'm in the wedding party (again, one of three). \n My and my cousin's incomes over the last five years have vastly diverged. My cousin's income has skyrocketed in the last 5 years, about $120,000 now I believe. A year ago I was making minimum wage. I recently busted my ass looking for new work and started a job for $45,000k a month ago. Buying a plane ticket isn't trivial to me. \n What's more, my cousin is a man of expensive tastes. The night will no doubt involve high-end scotch, cigars, steak dinner and strippers. I'm not into any of these things. I'll also be splitting my cousin's tab (by one third) which I'm dreading will be between $600-$1000 for the night. \n I've already bought a $350 suit (there was an option to rent, but it was clear he preferred we purchase a tailored suit) and another $350 on a plane ticket home for the wedding (less than a month after the Bachelor party). I also recently incurred a BS $270 charge from a car rental agency (some context).  Technically  I could get together the money required, but there would be ripples in my budget for the rest of the year. \n I'm a minimalist. I own nothing aside from investments, a laptop and a desk top, my bed, and a small amount of kitchenware. I live in a basement apartment that's literally empty aside from these few items. My cousin just bought a brand new home and owns a condo. I feel he's not considerate of the difference between our financial capabilities. Not to mention not knowing (or caring?) that I simply do not subscribe to the ultra-consumerist lifestyle he abides by. \n I will probably get married someday, but I will not have a large wedding or an expensive bachelor party because, again, these things are not congruent with my lifestyle. I would also never expect anyone involved in my wedding to cover large bills. Most likely, I'd just elope. haha. \n So am I a selfish ass? Is this a completely inconsiderate thing for me to contemplate? Part of me wants to say I can either cover 1/3rd of his tab, or by the ticket to attend, but not both. The other part of me doesn't even really want to attend an event like this, because it's just so not me. \n Help!?	In high income cousin's wedding party. Do not really want to fork up more money than I already am (for the wedding) to fly home for his bachelor party. Not sure what to do. Help? \n edit: words	404	37	needadvice
I met my friend online, and we have been talking every day since we've met in early 2014. I'm a girl and he's a guy. \n A few hours ago he opened up to me and told me he's going through a phase of depression. He told me in the past that he had cut himself when he was younger. He has been diagnosed with depression in the past, but only recently has it started up again. \n My heart really goes out to him, however there is no way for me to physically be there for him.. The best I can do is just chat with him online or through Skype. I feel terrible that I can't be there for him any other way. I really want to help him. \n I myself have gone through a very small phase of what I felt to be a VERY mild case of depression. I know that I have no way of actually understanding what it is truly like for someone with chronic depression, but it makes me that much more motivated to help if what I experienced is only a very small glimpse of what depression is really like. \n I'm planning on studying to become a Social Worker or Therapist. I really want to help people around me. \n So I need some advice on how I should go about helping someone that is thousands of miles away from me in a different part of the world? \n Disclaimer: I wasn't sure if I should post this in this thread or in r/Relationships, so sorry if this is the case!

I've lost both of my grandfathers, but I didn't know one at all...and the other died when I was about 8 or 9 and I didn't understand it as much as I do now, so this is really the first person I've lost who's actually really meant much of anything to me. She died in an avalanche and my mom and I flew out to spend time with family, and I can't even look at a picture of her without breaking down. \n I think that's normal? But things feel especially hard for me because I'm recovering from an eating disorder and depression. \n Like I've looked up to her since I was little. She was my cool cousin who had tattoos and piercings and things, and the last time I got to see her was two years ago. And I won't even get to see her at a funeral again because she's being cremated. \n I'm going home today, and yesterday felt fine because no one was talking about it. But today my friend told me that they legitimately felt like killing themselves and I just broke down and I didn't know what to say because I didn't want to loose someone else, so I just said it's going to get better even though I know that's a shit thing to say to someone who's suicidal. They got upset, I told them I couldn't loose someone else, and they got off skype. And here I am making a post on /r/needadvice because I realized I'm really not ok.

Throwaway because it's better. \n I recently started a new full-time job in IT in which I share the desk with a few other people. \nOn the other side of the desk, facing me, slightly to the left, there's this 33yo Indian man. \n I exchanged a few words with him and he looks like a nice person, maybe a little bit shy. \n During the first day I noticed he was staring at me. The first time I smiled, and he smiled back. The following times I just had a quick glance at him after which he looked away. \n He keeps staring at me for 30sec, every 10 minutes or so. Seriously I'm thinking about keeping track about how many times I notice it. \nI can see it because he's in my eye field, and still sometimes I fall for it and look back at him to make sure he's really looking at me, and he is. \n I'm trying to be nice to him and he's too, it's just this staring thing that bothers me and distracts me from my job. \nIt's not super-easy to try and ignore the fact someone is deliberately staring at you multiple times, for the whole day. \n He takes the bus to go back home, I take the train. When I go out of the office he's already at the bus stop, and I usually say hi. Today he stopped me to ask which way do I walk (aka the directions to get to the train station). \n I don't know if I'm being paranoid or what, but I've got three options: \n \n He justs daydreams and he's not looking at me intentionally  \n He's gay and he's love in me (I'm a 21yo guy, for the record)  \n He wants to kill me \n \n What should I do?

So, I have been juggling this question in my brain for the past few months especially now, and I am just not certain on how I feel about it. Whether it's more important to have life, no matter of how much shit is wrong with it (homeless, jobless, unhappy, ill, stagnant, lonely, depressed,{insert personal life issue here}, etc). Or is it the quality of life that matters most. If you aren't happy in your life, and you have given it your all from the resources that you have to change that with no avail. Then is life really worth living? Hell, let's say you have managed to achieve a level of financial stability that you were looking for when you were younger. But now, in old age, you aren't able to participate in those things that you wanted to do so badly when you were younger. The only things you have now are regrets and unkempt promises to yourself. Is life worth having or suffering still then?	Which is most important and integral to life? Life itself or happiness in such life ?	167	16	needadvice

Hi everyone, Gujju Brahmin here (Fancy Lingo for I'm from the scholar's clan (which typically doesn't eat meat) and from the state of Gujarat in India) and needed some advice. I was born and lived in India until 2007 and moved to Canada afterwards. I never even bothered considering whether or not to eat meat as my family has always been very religious and being at home, there was no immediate need to eat non-vegetarian foods, or at least I thought so. Since then, I moved to university 6 hours north of where my parents live (for you guessed it- Engineering). \n While maintaining a diet based on what my mother made me in Grade 12, I gained a significant amount of weight and need to now loose it. My doctor has recommended a significantly higher quantity of protein than I had been consuming when was at home (mostly daal and protein shakes). \n Since moving over to university, due to a significantly more intense workload compared to High School, I found almost no time to cook the food myself and eat it. As a result I relied intensely on the school cafeteria which would rarely have vegetarian food other than pizza, pasta, and salad. By eating just those three and working out 4-5 times a week, I managed to lose around 20 pounds over the course of the semester. At this point a regular protein shake was my only source of protein \n However when I went home, my parents said that it wasn't enough and that I had to work harder. I talked to my roommate about the issue, who had also been overweight and got fit in a relatively small amount of time and he stated what my doctor had. I was lacking protein values and could not get healthier at a faster pace unless I started eating meat, otherwise I simply risked injury and over-exhaustion which I cannot afford as a First-Year university student. \n So here's the lowdown: If I do stay vegetarian, Parents will stay happy but I risk injury while attempting to lose weight. If I don't stay vegetarian and follow my doctor's advice, telling my parents will immediately remove financial support and destroy mine and their relationship If I keep it secret, I'm afraid it might come from someone else's mouth and cause the same effect as the one above. \n Needed some opinions/solutions as to what I should do based on the situation Thanks in Advance \n Some further information based on this thread : \n Due to my upbringing as a hindu, I do understand why I shouldn't as well as what the Gita's position is on it. I do not have any issues with killing/processing animals. Neither am I repealed from them however, I have not put a morsel of meat other than Poutine when I was new to the country and didn't know what the gravy consisted of so I'm not sure if something will change after I try it.

So I meant to post a while ago saying that I was doing horribly this semester and being on academic probation already would mean that I would most likely get kicked out, hence the username 'failingcollege'. I just got my letter in the mail today telling me that my grades were not good enough to continue on at my school. I never thought in a million years that I would fail out of college being an honor roll student in high school. Right now i'm just trying to digest everything that i've been told. My parents were the ones who actually opened the letter so they already know but now I have to explain to my family and friends why I am no longer attending this school. Needless to say I need to figure out what to do next and I was wondering if anyone who shared a similar situation could give some advice on what to do next and how to explain this to family and friends. Thanks.	Failed out of college and now trying to figure out what to do with my life.	169	16	needadvice
I don't know what to do about this since I live in an apartment complex and sure, I understand that there is going to be noise. That is the way most places are but my upstairs neighbor is so annoying. He blasts his music so loud that it shakes my floor. I live on the first floor so that says something. I have talked to him a few times to ask him to lower the music and he lowers it for a few hours then it goes right back up to the regular volume again. I am not sure if anyone else is bothered by this but I want to tell the landlord but I am too afraid that this guy will retaliate against me and I just want quiet. I don't mind a little noise, just not enough to shake my floor. \n What can I do to remedy this issue?

"Hi Guys Please give me some suggestions as to what I can do because I feel helpless against these big companies. \n I ordered a watch ($100) for my gf as a Christmas present on Shnoop.com first week of December. Around 2 weeks later, I realize I have not yet received the item so I emailed Shnoop for a tracking. When I received the tracking (at school) I immediately tracked it and it show it was delivered a day ago. A bit confused, because I was home all day the day before and even picked up my mail from my mailbox but no packages whatsoever. Printed out the tracking page and took it to the local postal office to ask. They told me that the only information they have was that it was delivered as according to the tracking and the signature was waived. WHO AUTHORIZED THE POSTAL WORKER TO WAIVE THE SIGNATURE WHEN SOMEONE WAS ELIGIBLE TO SIGN?? WHATS THE POINT OF SHIPPING WITH SIGNATURE CONFIRMATION WHEN SOMEONE CAN JUST WAIVE IT BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE IT?? Anyways, told the postal worker that I am certain I did not receive it, she gave me a piece of paper with instructions to open up a claim. Went home and followed the instructions...guess what? Can only open a claim if item is insured. I called the USPS customer service, said they cannot do anything unless the item is insured. So I went back to Shnoop.com and asked them for insurance information. No reponse after a few days. Open a claim with paypal to dispute the transaction, was rejected immediately as the ""tracking"" was provided to me. If the item was insured, I would have directly opened a claim with USPS but none was provided. Currently I am at a lost of $100 (as a poor college student) with no item to give to my girlfriend, and no money to buy her another one. I feel really cheated out of this experience, if this is the result, I do not feel safe doing business with online merchants expect for Amazon."	ordered something on Shnoop, tracking shows delivered but I did not receive, ignored by Paypal, postal service and Shnoop.

Let me begin by saying I suffer from social anxiety, and my current lifestyle is leading me into a deeper and deeper depression. I was born and raised where I live in this small city and never fit in with my peers. I've lived my whole life on the outside looking in. I wake up physically ill at the thought of carrying out another useless day in a town I hate.  I don't know who I am, what makes me ME, or what I enjoy in life. My mind is numb and my only perspective on life is through a television screen, behind a steering wheel, or on the other side of a service counter.  My only family ties are my mother, father, and grandmother... Even they seem like strangers to me. I have no real friends - just people who agree to hang out with me some times. All I really have holding me back is a s*** $12.50/hour job, a few bills, a cat and gadgets to distract myself when I'm not working. \nFor years I've longed to drop my current existence and experience life elsewhere, immersing myself in other cultures... To conquer my aversion to human interaction... And to learn more about myself. Feelings of wanderlust cloud my dreams, both day and night. The want, no - need - to take part in something meaningful is always growing.  Virtually having nothing holding me back, I guess what scares me is falling on my face and ending up jobless, homeless, and defeated.  I've clicked many links on Google and many of the articles I read seem easier said than done.	I'm a nobody, blah blah self pity, and want to experience life abroad, find out who I really am, learn, and grow. But I'm tied back with fear (not to mention I am without savings).

I'm 18 and I live in B.C. Canada. I work at a typical minimum wage job at a fast food place. It's not the job that's shit, it's the owner. To say this guy is a dick is an understatement. This guy is a colossal asshat. Not even an hour ago this guy straight up fired a guy on the spot for drawing a face on the burger wrapper. Yelling and swearing to the point where customers were concerned. He's constantly yelling at us and causing unneeded stress to an already understaffed staff. We don't have workers comp, which I'm pretty sure is illegal here, we don't get paid over time, and he makes us do things we aren't qualified to do based on little to no training, just because he doesn't want to pay the company to come clean it.

Hi. So my mother came to this country legally back in the 80's on a temporary work visa. She worked through that and when it expired she decided to stay in the country. She worked under a fake social security number for four years as she tried to acquire her green cards. She then had me. Once I was born she began working under the table and taking government benefits for me (it was the only way she could make ends meet being a single parent) the method she was following to acquire her green card ultimately lead her to pay 10,000 dollars to a lawyer that at the end of the day had nothing to show for the money and just kept asking for more. My mom resigned from it, took the loss and determined to have me sponsor her once I turned 18. Years came and went and when I turned 18 we realized I could not sponsor her until I was 21. So be it. 3 more years of waiting. Turned 21, graduated from college, got a job. Things have been going underway. She has been filing taxes using her Employment Identification Number for the past four years and things were going well. \n Then she had a heart attack 2 years ago. She has become practically disabled. She now works just enough cleaning homes to make ends meet with me supplementing her income as best I can. The plan was for her to get her green card and get on SSI benefits or really anything to ease this burden and keep her from working herself to death. \n I have just learned that apparently someone with a green card needs 10 years of taxed income in order to get SSI benefits, or really any benefits from the government otherwise they will be deducted from my wages. \n At this point we're both at our ropes ends. We don't know what to do. If she has to work another 6 years she will surely die as the only work she can do is clean houses which is hard work especially for someone whose had a heart attack. On the other hand I don't make nearly enough to support her completely, nor could I pay off the government should she take benefits. Returning to her home country is not much of an options since being estranged from her family for 20+ years has left her with no home to return to. \n What do we do? Are there any loopholes that we don't know about? Could she files back taxes for the past 15 years? I don't know enough about this, but it seems like other people find a way. I really don't know what to do and I just want my mom to live a happy life, I don't want her keeling over at work in the next year or two.	mother is illegal immigrant, hopefully soon will get a green card, not eligible for benefits, needs 6 more years of employment.

Most people who do things like camping, rock climbing or skiing are a lot like me: I'm 23, an engineer so very technical minded, athletic and good with my hands (carpentry and woodworking). \n I want to pick up new outdoor hobbies, but I feel intimidated by the fact that I lack experience. Rock Climbing is not something a noob can just walk out into the mountains (or even a gym) and do. \n I have friends who are into some of the more extreme outdoor activities, but I feel embarrassed (and like a bit of a burden) to ask for instruction. Professional instruction is often geared toward children. How do I get into rock climbing? And do you have any outdoor activities that are better geared toward adult noobs? \n I'm in New England, so it's a shame not to be doing these things!	version: How does a noob get into rock climbing, camping or skiing?

"Context: I'm a freelance director, working on my first corporate film. It's the first time I've earned enough from my work to live off, so it's a particularly big deal to me. \n The film is commissioned by a trust which supports various youth clubs. They want me to cover the ways in which three clubs have made provisions for the inclusion of disabled young people. \n The woman who runs the third club told me that she takes issue with the word ""disabled"" being used to describe service users. She said the service users at her club have learning difficulties, autism, and emotional and behavioural problems, but no (as she described them) ""physical disabilities"" e.g. paraplegia. She doesn't want these kids featured in the film if they're going to be branded ""disabled"" by the title. \n So far, I mostly get what she means, although I'd still like to find an airtight definition of ""disabled"", if one exists. \n Then she said that the target audience of this film, 250 youth workers, would most likely feel the same way and disapprove of the word ""disabled"" being used in the film at all. \n I've contacted the film's commissioner and floated the idea of focussing on the word ""inclusion"" instead, but I feel like I'm somewhat out of my depth on this particular issue. \n Can anyone tell me if there's a collective term that is more appropriate than ""disabled people"", a la ""LGBT""? (I am, for the record, aware that LGBT or LGBTQ is not without its own detractors as a collective term.) \n Any help from those in the know would be hugely appreciated."

So I just finished my first week at a new company. My position is a project engineer at an advanced machining company (specializes in gas turbine component EDM operations), and for my first 2 weeks, they will have me on an apprentice-type program where I work with the EDM operator all day (10+ hours/day) so that I can learn the machine entirely to the point where I can run parts on my own. \n Well anyway, since my first day, I found that I had loose ends to tie up regarding my resignation from my previous employer (some paperwork was filled incorrectly and company property had to be returned, etc.) To fix things, I had to spend some time speaking on the phone on some occasions and was obviously away from the floor (no cell policy) during that time. There was even 2 occasions where I had to drive up to my employer, which I did during lunch. Regarding that last item, engineers have 1 hour lunch, and operators have 30 mins, so I took the full hour (once went 15 mins over) to take care of the loose ends. And at the risk of sounding weak, as I am used to spending most time siting at a desk, I found it to be extremely painful on my heels and back having to stand on a hard surface for several hours (sitting is frowned upon) especially on the steel toes I had to wear, so there was an occasion where I couldn't bear it, and went to the break room to sit and chat with a future coworker. On that note, I also spent time away from the floor trying to meet some of my colleagues and chat about the company and their experiences. \n On my 3rd day I was approached by the HR manager reminding me that I need to be on the floor the entire time, as even the general manager and some operators have noticed my absences (this occurred during the first 3 days I was there.) The very next day I made sure I was on the floor all day, and plan on keeping it that way. \n However, I am worried that I might have given a negative first impression because of my actions. Should I talk to the GM and explain? I have a review in 90 days, and don't want this early incident to reflect negatively on me, especially since I plan on having a stellar performance from here on out. I also do not want to appear as though I am giving excuses, but I felt that I kinda had a legitimate reason for my stumbles. \n Sorry for the long text, I am just kinda bummed out since I did a lot of preparation for this job; the loose ends just kind of came up unexpectedly. Am I thinking too much about this, should I try to justify my actions, or just ensure that I do not repeat my mistakes and leave it at that? \n Thanks for reading.	Engineering job, was supposed to be on the floor with operator all day to learn machines for a few weeks.

"My brother (26 yo) spends all his time playing video games and smoking weed. I can relate to these activities and do  not  find them intrinsically problematic, because I do them myself. But he does this all day, every day. He doesn't work (quit a good job several months ago) and he lives with my father, who is too afraid to put his foot down about any of this, because he fears it will cause my brother to (a) commit suicide or (b) become homeless. \n My brother only has a highschool education and he quit his job because he was unhappy there. I suspect that there's other things in his life that truly made him unhappy, but he won't go deep into his true feelings with me so I cannot be sure. At first when he quit his job I told him he should use this time to ""focus on himself,"" aka get into physical shape, enjoy the summer, practice ball, etc. I thought that if he got into a physical healthy place it might help his confidence and lead to a mentally healthy place. Although he initially did great and was exercising daily, he's since fallen off with his work out routine and when I ask him if he's still exercising, he gets angry and defensive. \n I know my brother is unhappy, but he has an  extremely  difficult time communicating his feelings. He's not a great communicator generally, but whenever I ask him how he's feeling or how he's doing he gets super defensive immediately. My brother told me via text recently that he's not coming to my cousins wedding, because he feels ashamed. When I asked him about this he wouldn't elaborate and said it doesn't imply he's unhappy. This lack of communication is my biggest frustration when trying to understand/help him. \n I try encouraging him to open up to me or asking him how he's doing. I usually either get a straight-up non response or he will send me a one-to-several word response back ending the conversation before it begins. I really want to do whatever I can to help my brother, but I'm running out of ideas because he's continually distancing himself from everyone around him. \n My brother is depressed, he's embarrassed, he's ashamed, he withdraws whenever I, or anyone, reaches out to him and I'm worried he's suicidal. Please tell me what I can do (or not do) to help him."

Long story - My coworker works himself to death, we've had repeated conversation about him needing to learn to say no, pass projects on to me or talk to our boss. Yesterday it just sort of blew up and I'm at the point where I am so done with him. \n He's been talking about leaving since February, but hasn't found a job. (Which when I heard this in February, I was devastated because he was a role model/mentor/bestie in the work place back then.) \n HR has talked to him about being a flight risk; Upper management has given him some benefits to reward him for his hard work (which he then brags to all of us about.) He complains about the work environment; which another one of our coworker and our HR rep hear all the time and are on the Culture Crew Committee. They have been working really hard to change the atmosphere of our office and from when I started a little over 2 years ago, it's become A LOT better. Then when we have done some fun things, he refuses to participate and says we are going to destroy the company we merged with last year. (They have a really fun, young and open work environment.) \n After another lovely blow-up discussion with him, after he complained to a director about our sales kick-off being held separate from our customer event and also not online like it was a few years back. (I'm sorry they are sales, the need to be energized and motivated to make the company money.) I had a talk with my female coworker and I basically told her if his personality doesn't change or if he doesn't find another job I'm searching for a new job come June. I can't handle his negativity and everyone keeps coming to me asking is he okay and how can we make things better.

Background: I work in a plant with very specialized equipment as an analytical chemist. As part of quality control, nothing is authorized to leave the premises without our consent. The lab is very small (4 people). All four of us have been hired within the last 4 years, 3 of us in the last 1.5. I have been working here for almost a year. \n It has recently come to my attention that the entire lab is severely underpaid compared to other areas of the plant. The chemical operators (which have no educational prerequisites or prior experience to be eligible for hire) are currently paid under a tier system based on time working and number of processes they can perform. \n To give some kind of idea, an operator and one of the chemists were hired within a month of one another. The operator has now been promoted twice and there is now a 14K difference in base pay between the two. \n Needless to say, when I found out about the operator payscale and about the obvious pay disparity, I told my colleagues about it and they are livid. We are planning on going to the administration soon to ask for a substantial raise. The number I have in mind would be around a 27% raise. \n Is this acceptable given what we know now? Should we let the administration know that we're aware that we're being underpaid? Again being in the quality control department, we have leverage in this situation.

Hi. Let me start from the beginning. \nI was born and raised in a small town. I was always shy and bad at interacting with humans. I noticed early on that one way I could overcome this was to crack jokes. I also noticed early on that I could take a punch, as people like to hit things that laugh at them. I digress. I never knew quite where to fit in or exercise my desire to laugh and make people laugh. Then, one day, theatre happened. I auditioned for a play - nothing big, but it brought a crowd for all four shows. My wings spread majestically as I took the stage and recited the lines I had worked for weeks cramming into my brain. I was at home. Being on stage was (and still is) the most liberating experience for me. I felt like a skyscraper in a one story town. My fire was ignited. After that, I looked for all the opportunities available to stand on a stage. But, like a kid born and raised in a small town, I was still in a small town. I went to college and studied theatre. I took other classes, but they only enforced the idea that I was searching for something with more weight than a stack of papers.  The plays that I performed in, the monologues I prepared and the improvisation I partook in were only fanning the flame that everyone around me tried to so desperately extinguish. Now, here I am. I am working a job that, every day, clips a piece of the wings, which were at a time on fabulous display. I don't know where to go. I don't know how to start. The Internet is a landfill comprised of 13 year olds with iPhones. I yearn to be back in the place where I can be myself - a person pretending to be someone else. I write this with the hopes that someone will see. I write this with the hopes that someone can share some light because my flame is dying, and I don't want to go forward in darkness. If you have any tips. Any suggestions. Any idea that could help me, my 15 year old self and I would forever be grateful.	I want to get into acting. I have no idea where to start, and I have no connections. Any suggestions?	381	20	needadvice
"So my ex husband introduced our 3 year old child to a new woman less than a week after our divorce was finalized, and he got engaged to her just a couple of months later.  They got married, and 7 months later she left him in part due to his anger issues.  She contacted me that evening and we talked for a bit.  They divorced when our child was 5, and the moment their divorce was finalized, he cut off all contact between her and our child.  This woman was like a stay at home mother to our child, she was there constantly in her life for those two years.

I told her that we weren't comfortable with it, and that any visitation would have to come out of the father's time.  After all, I barely know this woman, we've only met two or three times. \n The excessive calling and clinginess was the worst of the issues until today.  I overheard her FaceTime conversation with my child.  My little one asked her why she moved away, and she said: \n ""Your Daddy was ugly to me and called me names, and your daddy wouldn't get a job.  Daddy wanted to keep me away from my family.  Daddy has problems and he needs to see a doctor about them.  I tried to get him to see a doctor, but he wouldn't go."" \n I was absolutely floored in shock.  Yes, my ex husband was abusive in many ways (physically and verbally to me, verbally to the 2nd wife), and he went through jobs faster and was unemployed more than anyone I've ever known, but I have never once badmouthed my ex in front of my child because I believe it's wrong to do so, and this woman has definitely crossed a line. \n I'm really torn at this point as to whether I should make it clear to her that she crossed a line and allow the contact to continue, or if I should cut her off. \n Any suggestions?"

Hey /r/needadvice, I am stuck deciding my future. I'm a 24 y/o male, stuck at a dead-end helpdesk job who wants more. I just got married (no problems there), but don't want to be stuck in IT forever. A few years ago I decided I wanted to enlist in armed forces, but decided against it because of my wife (fiance at the time). I made the sacrifice for her, but haven't been able to get that out of my mind for around 3 years. \n I recently found that I have an opportunity to return to school for engineering (6+ years though). Wereas Mechanical/Aerospace Engineering intrigues me (also the pay is great), although I don't think I would enjoy being behind a desk 100% of the time.\nMy wife says she supports me with whatever decision I make, but I know she hates the idea of me enlisting and being gone for an extensive period of time and being potentially in harms way. I have been racking my brain with what to do for years, becoming depressed due to stress and work and it's taking a toll on our relationship - so I need to decide soon. \n What can I do? Are there other options for one who wants to work with his hands, help people, and make an impact on the world?	Can't decide careers, one hand-engineering, other hand-military. Wife doesn't want me in the military, but wants me to be happy.	222	20	needadvice
I have a long-term boyfriend who I'm very happy with. There's no issue with the sex beyond usual long-term stuff of wanting it more and not letting work and busyness get in the way. For about a week and a half each month, I feel like a teenager again. This expresses itself in my past fantasy of being sexually desirable to random guys on the street or subway. I'm turned on by the idea of being wanted by lots of men but being unattainable. The problem is not that I want to have sex with tons of people but that I'm distracted by the desire of wanting to be considered desirable but out of reach. Is this directly related to my hormones? Will they calm down eventually or is this it??	I love being thought of hot but unattainable by random men on the street but am distracted by this desire. Is it directly related to going on birth control? Will my hormones normalize? \n Also, this is a throw away.	131	39	needadvice
Basically a question about where I should take my summer as a college student studying industrial engineering. I recently got a job at company doing work in a department that isn't my field. Nothing spectacular, just data entry. The last semester I worked as a consultant for start-ups and this is a significant change, to say the least.\nThe company has a department that is more the domain of industrial engineers, so I was thinking of contacting the managers / HR to try to transfer in there.\nI'm also currently taking three summer classes to graduate on time. I asked my manager about working less than full time to manage my courseload, and was told no. Best I got was working long hours and getting a free day. \nOf course, if I don't graduate on time, it's another at least 25-34k for tuition, meals, and housing. If I stay with the job that gives me skills (time management, attention to detail, endurance for mental anguish) that are not specific to my field, it's 3-5k.\nIf I don't do the data entry job, I would be operating a summer business just to pay the food and weekend expenses. The courseload would be manageable then. If I transfer into their industrial engineering related department, I'd reduce my courseload since relevant work experience is incredibly valuable. Irrelevant work experience I don't think is as valuable. Not really sure on what to do.	Should I quit my data entry job irrelevant to my field or reduce my courses that would prevent me from graduating in a timely manner?	239	25	needadvice
"So today my mom called me and tells me to move away from my wife so she can tell me something. I really didn't expect to ever hear these words but my mom tells me that she found naked pictures of my wife on my little brother's secret Facebook account. No she didn't send them to him. I must have left my email open on my mom's computer one day and he must have went in there and dug deep specifically looking for something like naked pics. They were from years ago so I am only lead to believe that he searched for them on my email because you can't just stumble across it by accident (I checked thoroughly). He has this secret fb account with nothing but porn and porn pics on it and today he left it up by mistake. What sucks is my step dad found this and now two men have seen my wife's goods. As of recently my mom has been pissed at him for spending hours (literally hours) in the bathroom and we know why he's in there so long. But now to think that pics of my wife were in some of my little brother's masturbation sessions actually disgust me. I told my older brother and he told me to invite him over tonight and ""smack the fire out of him"" and then explain why I did so. I'm not at that level of anger but I'm more pissed because I will have to tell my wife that my little brother saw him naked and she will piece together the masturbation aspect of things. It will sicken her because she truly loves him as a little brother. What should I do guys? How do I handle this so that my wife will come out ok an that family get togethers won't be extremely awkward for everyone.

"For the past two years I have lived with my grandparents caring for them. After my grandmother was left seriously disabled from a stroke I moved in to cook and chauffeur for my grandfather. \n Obviously all this care taking could not be done alone, my two uncles are at the forefront, organizing the years worth of medical red tape, and I and the Agency do the caring. \n For the past year we had this STNA coming in and caring for both my grandparents, up until my grandfathers death. Now she comes in daily for her shift with my grandmother (I am only overnight watch). \n At first the women and I had much in common, we shared the same religious and political views and even cultural interests. Slower but surly she began to show her sneaky ways. \n It started with the finagling of her hours, always showing up late with the same excuse, and then lying about her time on the schedule, all the while my uncles stupidly bought into her same excuses. Shortly after this, she starts to bring over her grandson unbeknownst to my uncles. This little child caused allot of trouble around the house, and she even guilted me into baby-sitting them during her shift for an entire summer. \n After my Uncles finally resized she is not being paid to watch her grandson at work, they told her no more of that. A few months later the grandson returns after my uncles just give in and say ""well at least hes not bothering grandma!"" He actually is, but everything goes over my uncles heads. He continues to wake me every morning the past few months, and after the damn broke I called my uncles to rant, who in turn texted the caretaker. \n Now as I came out of my room, she scowled at me, and continued on about how I ""snitched"" on her several times and ""this was it"". See at first she saw me as a little pal, someone she could share little secrets with, except when it comes to deceiving my family (finagling of hours etc.) of course I am going to step forward. \n Now not only is she completely rude to me, but she is completely negligent - she went from an excellent caretaker to a lazy person who actually sneaks naps while my disabled grandmother sits alone in a different room of the house. She talks to my grandma as if she were a little baby, although my grandmother has speech connection issues, she is still mentally capable. Again, my uncles do not buy it, or know it happens but ignore it. \n What makes it worse, now that she is upset with me, she tells me she is going to ""accidentally"" let me cats out , something she knows is a serious issues for me. She knows how protective I am of my two kitties, and porously leaves the side door open despite me telling her on a daily basis to keep the door shut, also three signs around and on the door itself. \n This woman needs to go, I attempted to record her, but I am thinking a hidden camera to catch her negligence (napping, leaving the house itself). I really need help on this one guys, I am just so lost and my quality of life is already questionable, as a 22 year old who dropped out of school to take care of a sick old man, I had to watch all my friends move on and graduate, and go on vacation, while I sat in a dark family room far into the early morning watching my grandfathers demise."	Manipulative, negative caretaker needs to go, but family wont listen. \n Edit, this woman no longer works with an agency, she is hired in through us privately.	607	26	needadvice
"My mother is a devout christian (don't know exactly what branch, she\u2019s been in many). Every single thing that happens to her life (and everyone else\u2019s) is gods will. She would go to church 3-4 days a week\u2026not that big of a deal. She fasts often and gets sick from it. The doctor says she needs to eat or she'll keep getting sick. She ignores the doctors orders and says god energizes her\u2026ok? Every single time I try to have a normal conversation with her, she would always shift it to preaching; saying that one day I'll be going to church and serving god\u2026I never will. I try to reason with her\u2014never dispelling her beliefs but only trying to be positive and inclusive. She denies it saying that god wants things his way. My late father, brother and I have been dealing with this for close to 20 years since she converted from catholicism. My dad was always getting into fights with her because of it. Saying that she spends more time with the church than at home with the family. My brother has been very quiet about the whole situation but he agrees that mom is pending too much time with church. I on the other hand, have been defending her. I've told my dad and brother that all she does is stay home and look after the grandchildren hardly ever goes out. She needs friends\u2014we all do. And if this is her way of being happy, then let her do her thing. \n But today was the day that I feared would happen. I spoked to her over the phone, excited that all of us would go down south to visit some relatives for a cousin's wedding. She's not going. Citing the all-too-familiar ""I've got commitments with the church"", she said that she wouldn't go. I countered that she always has commitments with the church and that she should maybe reschedule 'til after the wedding. BIG. MISTAKE. Her tone changed and basically told me to shut up and never ever question her because I'm not understanding of gods word. \n My sexuality came to light years ago and although it took months of a frayed relationship and 10-years living out of state, she still loves me and wants me to be happy. I believe her, but I also believe that she blames herself for it and dedicates herself to church and all its needs to try to redeem this sin. It kills me to think that she's going through this because of me. \n I want to tell her that I want her to be happy too, but at the same time\u2014deep down inside, I don't want her blind devotion to deny who she really is; a strong and independent woman as well as a loving mother to us all. And I don't want her to be taken advantage of by the church (different story. Too long of a story to get into). But now, she basically crossed a line I hoped she never would; siding with the church."	My mother\u2019s devotion to her church has isolated herself from her family denying us all from reasoning with her. \n Edit: I could flesh this out more but I figured you guys would ask more if needed.	508	36	needadvice
Hello Reddit, using a throwaway so my family/friends don't see this. I am a 21 year old who has made a lot of poor life decisions. I took out loans when I went to school and when I dropped out, I had to pay them all back. I have finally paid them back, but now I'm on financial aid probation for a year. Basically, i have to come up with tuition for a year before they will allow me to receive the funds for tuition. This is part 1.\nPart 2 is, my car broke down. It is actually multiple issues on top of each other that happened today. The window fell into the door, the tube that transfers the power steering fluid was found to be ripped, there is a nail in my tire and I don't know how to fix any part of that other than the tire.\nThe third part of my issue is I have no money. I live paycheck to paycheck and recently lent my mother my savings account to help her get out of her own financial hole. Wrong timing I guess.\nSo basically, I have no car and my commute to work is around a 20 minute drive. I have no bike. I have no promise of a college education, I have no money to fix any of my cars issues. Has anyone been in a similar situation before? If you have, I really need some help. I've been going over this in my head for hours and can't seem to come up with a solution.\nNo car pool service at work, family can't drive me, no one to borrow money from, can't get a credit card since no credit, failed to receive financial hardship from school.	I have no money, no car, can't get to my job and just found out that I won't be able to get into college due to financial restrictions the school has set on me. Any guidance?\nbtw, not asking for money. I know that is against the rules.	294	48	needadvice
"I had this accidentally posted in askreddit, glossed over the rules, have reposted it here.\nSo I'm taking a debate class and I'm on the negative side of the debate. My current argument is very narrow: The third wave of feminism currently says that when a man and a woman are both drunk and engage in consensual sex its a man raping a woman. I think that this is sexist to women because it says that a woman isn't capable of making her own sexual choices while under the influence of alcohol. If two women were to engage in consensual sex would it be a woman raping a woman?\nI'm not sexist, from what I've heard about the ""3rd wave of feminism"" it basically blames issues on men instead of empowering and motivating women to advance themselves and overcome sexist stereotypes."

"Ok so I work in a close-knit office (about 40 employees) where I'm pretty much the youngest person there. I've been here for about 8 months now.  It's my second job since out of college (graduated spring 2013, was with an agency for 2 years then laid off). \n When I first started working here, people were very nice and welcoming to me. Nowadays nobody will even acknowledge me in the hallway, or if anything I'll get a weak ""Hi"". Because of this, my anxiety levels have been at an all time high and I find myself less compelled to go to work. I get really paranoid and I try avoiding any contact with my coworkers because I feel like they would rather not speak to me. If I do run into them I put on my customer service voice and I try asking him how their day was and such but the conversation is dry for the most part. I'm not an antisocial person, I can go out and have normal conversations with people. I'm nice and very open to having conversations with anyone willing to approach me. I feel that I can mesh well with people according to their interests and overall personality. But for some reason I can't connect with my coworkers. \n Some background info: I think about 2 months into working, I got a little jaded and I realized that working in this cubicle for the rest of the life just isn't for me. I was tired of having meaningless conversations, I felt my days going by in my cubicle, the mundane projects were making me feel useless in my field. My apathy grew because I realized that I was working at a much lower rate of pay for a job that I'm not even passionate about. I had to adapt my lifestyle for a budget that fit with my new minuscule of a salary. I tried really hard seeking an outlet from all of this, but working this 8-5 job had me super exhausted by the time I got home from work. I think at one point I couldn't hide my resentment and it got so bad to the point where my supervisor had to talk to me one on one to let me know my work production was being affected. I realized I had to suck it up, people were being affected by my egotistical woes. I cleaned up my act and since then I've been making a conscious effort to work productively and effectively since then. However, the isolation of my coworkers is creating some sort of internal frustration that seems to be growing at an exponential rate. It's very distracting."	Started new job with high hopes, realized it wasnt for me. Had trouble with composure in the office, now my coworkers dislike me.	447	23	needadvice
"Hi Reddit, \n I try to be a fairly nice human being, but sometimes people take advantage of my good nature. \n Currently I'm in a pickle and I'm not sure what to do. The Spanish-speaking guy (we'll call him Antonio because that's his name) at the deli in my local supermarket is very friendly. He always says hello to me even though I never shop at the deli. \n One day he asked me for help with his computer. Now, I used to work in IT but now I'm more of a database guy. As anyone in that field knows if you don't use your knowledge, you lose it. It's been two years so I'm way behind. I told him, as best I could since there is a significant language barrier, that I am not the best person to help him. \n The next time I went to the grocery store, he came over to me and asked again. I tried explaining to him again that no, I could not help him. Then he asked me for my telephone number so he could contact me about helping him. \n I was so shocked I just... gave it to him. This was a terrible move. \n Now he texts me all the time asking when we can work on his computer. I tell him, ""Let me know when you are free,"" but the language barrier is such that he doesn't know what that means. So I see him in the store and he tells me how I never called him and he really needs help. \n Now he texts me every day asking for help with his computer. I can't even schedule time with this guy to do some remote support, so I'm almost 100% positive we won't even be able to communicate about what his problem is. (In the past when I've tried to figure out what he wants to do, exactly, I have gotten various responses from ""I want to learn Microsoft,"" to ""I love 80s music,"" and ""Thank me for help you."") \n I don't want to switch grocery stores, this one has great produce. I don't want to tell his manager, cause I think that's kind of a nasty thing to do. But I don't want him thinking that I'm his personal, free computer trainer, either. I'd also like to not have to dread going to the store. He's snuck up on me a number of times and it's just uncomfortable. \n What would you do, fellow Redditors?"

"Hi all. 27F asking for advice because I feel like I've put myself in a situation that has caused some serious detriment to myself and my future. I moved to another country to be with my partner, who owns a company which I was to work for. Sold my car, possessions, quit the job I loved, lost my friends, moved into a new situation where he was the only person I knew, as well as being the only person I could legally work for in my new country. Looking back, I should have known that this would take a toll on me. Now I'm 100% financially dependent on him, and I have no work experience to show for this year that I've been here because, surprise, his company isn't working on anything right now so there's nothing for me to actually do. I've been staying busy by playing music, cooking, cleaning, gardening... nothing that really adds to the skill sets required for advancing a career. I don't have to have a care in the world, but I am fraught with worry about my future. I looked at my resume the other day and started crying, because it feels like this gap in work experience just threw everything I'd done previously down the drain. I've lost quite a bit of my confidence, socially and otherwise. I feel like I'm turning into the equivalent of a hollywood housewife. I don't want to be that. I don't want others to view me as that. One of my worst fears is being asked ""So, what do you do?"" because I feel like that's when I lose the respect of the person. I need to have an answer to this question. I want to be a responsible person who works and has a place in society. A reason to get up in the morning, like I used to. It makes it hard to feel like an adult, otherwise. I am very angry that he told me I would have a job here, and yet there's nothing. It was one of the stipulations that I moved and quit the job that I loved, was that I needed to be able to work, yet here I am. I don't plan on moving back, as I don't plan on ending this relationship. But I feel like I need to gain my independence back if I'm going to feel like I have any value besides being somebody's girlfriend. I need to start taking steps towards feeling like a whole, capable, worthwhile person on my own again, and I have no idea where to start, given the circumstances. I feel alone, worthless, and really, really stupid for thinking I was strong enough of a person to make the move that I did. I am terrified at what would happen if he ended things. I would have nothing. This puts a lot of pressure on our relationship and that's not how I want things to be. \n I guess it all boils down to a few questions. How do you gain confidence as an adult without the ability to possess a legitimate job? How do you find your place in a society that you're not allowed to work in? How do you start feeling like a capable, productive person worthy of respect without the ability to further or even possess a career? This is tough stuff, and I am at a loss. Thanks for listening and any advice you have to give, Reddit. It means so much to know that people are listening."

"So first post forgive me if I am doing it all wrong. \n Writing because my newborn was sent to icn about a week ago. As anyone who has been to an ICU or ICN might know you are in close quarters with other patients. A few days ago another baby was brought in across from us.  A child of migrant parents that don't speak English and often need a translator I can only guess by the amount of equipment and volume of doctors in and out this kid has some serious problems.  His parents are there everyday, my wife and I see them give a friendly node and smile as they do like wise when we see each other everyday looking after our babies in the ICN. \n Today when visiting our baby who is improving after a surgery my wife and I started were both feeling pretty good again after some sleepless nights and days of worry.   I I then noticed a large entourage of doctors started to gather around or ICN neighbors  baby and then the parents and translators showed up.  Being only 6 feet I couldn't help but over hear they were planning a transplant of organs for their baby apparently a doner organ that was a possible fit came available.  The doctors through the translator explained the process and that it was a long shot but might work.  My heart started to sink listening to the odds and yet the parents hope.  The last thing  I remember hearing them ask the mother was how she was feeling through the translator she said ""I am happy, but sad, scared, but I am happy"" wiping tears from her face.  Soon after they finished the talk the parents began to arrange a Chaplin to come and baptize their baby, I didn't see the mother leave her babies bed side for the rest of the day holding her bible looking over her baby with all his tubes and wires coming off him. \n It has been tearing me up since thinking about it what they are going through I can imagine is terrifying.  I want to do something for them but I don't have much in the way of funds and now that my baby is recovering I am now starting to worry about our own hospital bill. \n I am pretty sure the father is a labor and not made of funds either.

"i am in my mid 20s for reference. \n my girlfriend and I are best friends with another couple. the guy is my friend since i was like 5 years old. \n he took us aside, separately, to tell us that his girlfriend didn't want us coming over as much, playing as much games, or staying over as long (the drive is close to 2 hours so we would crash all weekend). we would hang out almost every weekend because they invited us... we  never  forced our way over there. we would also only stay if  he  asked and never planned to stay all weekend unless told to do so by  him . we would usually only stay for 1.5 days, tops. we would all hang out so it isn't like I was stealing time from her being with her man. \n at first i chalked it up to Bro-talk: ""uh uh yeah my girlfriend this, my girlfriend that"" but the fact he took my girlfriend aside annoyed me. it was REALLY harpy too. like... he told me 4 times that night, over and over again. he told my gf 2-3 times. his girlfriend, our best friend, never talked to us. weird, right? \n relevant: later that night when it was time for us to DD them home (we have a suspicion they only invited us for this reason; i don't drink) they flipped out on us because they thought we ditched them when all we did was go get the car for everyone. his girlfriend put up a huge fight and said  very  shitty things to us. we moved past it as they did apologize the next day but the side conversations never left our minds. \n jump head to now: \nwe have only hung out once since then, they no longer invite us to hang out, and are growing very distant. the tension sparked an outburst from my gf and we got all nitty gritty about the details and how we have felt betrayed for the past couple months. they held that against us and said ""well we apologized and you accepted it. i thought we moved on"". we did... from you thinking we ditched you and your shitty attitude,  not  from the details of a conversation she wasn't there to witness (although you know she told him to say those things). \n i stood my ground, defended our position and pretty much said that they have been bad friends since that night, gave them the details of what was said (they played dumb that they were drunk but it is a lie). we told them it brings us a lot of anxiety because we don't know what they expect from us in this relationship now because of the constant barrage of mixed signals. it REALLY put them off and now communication has ceased. \n my girlfriend and his girlfriend worked it out via text. i apologized to my friend privately and said sorry for getting so upset and sorry if i got him put in the doghouse with this girl (not my problem considering, but a nice gesture). nothing in response. \n what do we do? these are our last  true  friends as we are getting older and everyone is moving on so we are worried about losing them forever. we didn't do a single thing wrong aside from voice our opinion and tell them how we felt about the status of the friendship. now we are like lepers while they hang out with their cool new work friends."	we got yelled at for something we didn't do. we got told to stop hanging around so much (despite being told to do the opposite for as long as I can remember), and we voiced our opinions on how we felt we were wronged and now they won't even talk about it.	584	52	needadvice
"The title pretty well sums it up, but I'll elaborate a bit. \n About two months ago, my mom started calling to tell me about these letters and phone calls she'd been receiving. As soon as she explained to me what was being said, I instantly recognized what was happening. I told her exactly what was going to happen next - that being them asking her for money because her check ""got held up"" or as ""processing fee"" or something. Lo-and-behold, that's exactly what happened. \n I thought at first that she understood what was going on after I predicted the outcome, but evidently that isn't the case. She keeps getting ahold of me, exclaiming about how we're going to be set for life ""in a week or two"" and how ""it's not a scam this time."" I've been weathering the storm, so to speak, because I made her promise me that, at the very least, she wouldn't give anyone any money. \n Now she's texting me asking me if she can borrow some money. Something you need to understand about my mom is that she  always  has a bit of money set aside for whatever. She doesn't buy shit, so it's easy for her to save. She claims the money she's asking me to borrow is for her to get work done on her teeth, but when I asked her to produce receipts for the other $800 worth of stuff she purportedly got done, she said she shredded them. (Something else you need to understand about my mom is that she hordes receipts and paperwork for things like paper itself is going out of style.) So, obviously I suspect she blew whatever money she had previously saved on some Nigerian asshole somewhere and is asking me to lend her some to either 1) actually pay for her dental work after blowing her nest egg on scams, or 2) to throw away on yet more empty promises of a fat check. \n I don't know what to do. I don't want to just leave her to her devices to be taken for everything she has, but I don't know how to make this shit stop or make her understand what's happening. She's always been a naive person, but never outright stupid. And she's always been weary of trusting people (i.e. she's always kept a locked gas cap on her car, for instance), so I don't understand how she doesn't see through this.

I thought I could handle it (and I still do). I have a boyfriend, healthy relationship there, and I manage my time enough to maybe have a few hours to myself on the weekends. I play a varsity sport, but every night I go to sleep around 12 or 1, working from 6 until then to get all of my work done. I've dealt with depression and anxiety in the past and, despite having too much to do and so little time to think, I've felt better than I ever have with the antidepressants I'm on. I feel like life is looking up, but I'm walking a really fine line. \n Recently, I was approached for a partnership with a pretty big technology company. I have a very small chance of getting past the first few stages but god am I pumped. I was also approached for a chance to develop and help maintain a new web service partnered with the local university. Both of them sound extremely interesting to me, but with the work load I'm taking, I don't know if it's possible. Out of my six classes, five are university-level. My classes are interesting, none of them are subjects that don't fascinate me. Class goes well, I participate fine, I'm starting to get the harder material. I don't really have many qualms about university. I'm nowhere close to valedictorian, but, meh. I'm alright with that. \n Problem is, I have little time to myself. I enjoy being alone and during free periods at school, I've taken to hiding in holes in the wall (recently, a spot in an empty classroom behind the door where they used to store a vacuum) and avoiding problems and people. I wear headphones in the hall, not connected to anything, so people don't distract me. I could be sleep deprived or have a full night's rest but I still feel so drained about thirty minutes of getting to class. It's not the class; it's the people. I'm just horrible dealing with people. \n Between the people and the work, I'm worried I'm packing on too much. But I don't want to give any of it up. It's all FASCINATING.

My mom has just gotten the news that her cancer is back. This is the third time in the last 5 years. The second time was almost one year ago. The last time she went through chemo, she almost didn't make it. Mind you, it wasn't the cancer that almost killed her but all the side effects of the chemotherapy and its toll on her will to keep trying. It was horrible. She's almost 70 now and honestly has so much to keep going for, but the last time she went through it all, not only could she not eat, but the awful mental effects and sickness just killed her will to live. I'm concerned for her mental state as much as I am about her physical well being. She doesn't live in a state where medical marijuana is legal, but I know it could bring so much relief for her. Quite honestly, I think it might make the difference between her making it through this round of chemo with a strong desire to win. My question is this: how best can I approach her with this suggestion...knowing it's illegal and yet knowing it could be, in a sense, a miracle for her?  I'm particularly interested if you've been in a similar situation from either side of the coin. I'd love some help on this one, Reddit.	my mom has to go through chemo for the third time and I'd like some advise on how to suggest weed.	227	21	needadvice

Hi everyone, \n 23/M in Minnesota thinking about moving by myself to Colorado. I have savings and the opportunity to take my job with me and having lived here for 10 years and worked the same job for 4, I am getting really itchy to see some new scenery and hopefully find a new life that's not so dull. I will miss my family here and a couple friends, but otherwise no major obligations. \n There's nothing about Minnesota I particularly dislike, except that everything reminds me of something. I want a chance to go somewhere else and not be tied to my MN life or acquaintances. \n Anyways, I would love some additional advice from others who have done or felt similar. I understand that moving won't necessarily make me a new person, but I think the sheer stress/foreignness will provide a pretty good shock and incentive to be the person I want to be. I don't even want to think about spending ANOTHER year here sitting around and not working towards a better life, and I feel like the memories here are weighing me down. \n Pretty soon I'll be old, things will start to hurt, I'll be upset with myself that I didn't start a new life sooner.	tired of the same-old, want to be somewhere else. Ever felt the same, anything to else to consider? \n Thanks for your advice! :)	207	23	needadvice
"Okay here's the deal. Me and my SO have been wanting to move in together for awhile now. But we couldn't cause she needed a job and so did it. I found a job 7 months ago and her 3 months ago. Since then we both have been saving non stop. Now that we are able to afford it, she found a place right by her work for a great price. She'll be able to walk to work since she doesn't have a car. I need my car for work since I'm always traveling. I do want to move out with her. Dilemma is that right now I still live with my mom. I am 23. My gf has been living here too for the past two months. She's about the same age. About two months ago my dad moved out. Well my siblings and I wanted him out. My brother is 16 and my sister is 21. He is an alcoholic and abusive towards my mom, myself, and my siblings. He never hit us but he would be verbally abusive. He would hit my mom though. I thought that she was finally ready to divorce him and leave him behind. He's been abusing her for 20+ years. He had been paying the rent and I took care of some of the bills while he was living here. BTW he doesn't work, he gets a disability check. He had a stroke 2 years ago. He hasn't fully recovered. Mostly because he didn't want to. He literally told me he's ""retired"" and doesn't want to work anymore. But I think he is a terrible person and I never felt close to him. His first choice was always the alcohol. So two months ago, she said she wanted to divorce him. So that's when I agreed to take over all the bills and rent. My sister works too but only a part time job. But she helps when she can. My mom doesn't have a job and she hasn't been looking. I don't know why. I don't really talk to my mom. We are not that type of family. I dread to talk to her about serious stuff. I feel very awkward about it. Also she still keeps in contact with my dad. No divorce. And he even comes by here. Not inside the house though. If I move out, I would feel bad and selfish. I'm the only one with a vehicle. My dad took the other one. My brother still needs to get to school. I don't want to leave them just like that. I still want to help but since my mom doesn't have a job and it doesn't look like she's getting one soon, I feel like I'm stuck here. I know it'll probably be a good idea to just talk to her but I wouldn't even know where to start. I just feel like a bad guy. So advice?"

"Not too long ago, I went to a US-based plastic surgeon in order to get a nose job. During the surgery pre-consult, he asked me to take off my shirt to examine whether I'd benefit from surgery. Then, during the actual surgery, I distinctly remember him telling me that my chaperone (the person who went with me to the private, ambulatory care surgery center) had to leave. I was unaccompanied for the procedure. He then walked up to me and gave me a circular white pill with four indentations made inside of it, and told me to drink it with water. I did as instructed, even though I had doubts later when I was given a blue pill, a red pill, and another pill by the nurses (presumably for anesthesia). \n Now, I've been to other surgeons, and I've never been given Rohypnol before, nor have I been instructed to take off my clothes during consults or take off my underwear during the surgery (especially for surgery of the face). I also don't understand how a 4 hour procedure would require being under medication/anesthesia for 12 hours. I got to the surgery center at 7 am and wasn't ""awake"" again until 7 pm. I remember when I woke up from the medicine that I felt as though I was no longer a virgin; I also really, really vaguely remember screaming and seeing bright, white lights and blue clothes. I'm mad because I've been saving myself for marriage and I'm having a hard time understanding how someone could do this to me. \n I called the police and notified my parents when I started putting two and two together. I just want to make sure I'm not being out of line here, because I think that what this guy did--administering a controlled, FDA substance--is against the law. I also think it isn't fair that my marriage prospects are basically gone now that I'm damaged goods because I'm going to have an impossible time getting married because of this due to the cultural importance of bleeding on my wedding night. I'm a good Indian girl and I feel so ashamed of myself for not doing anything about looking into this sooner. \n Please help me."	US Plastic Surgeon gave me Rohypnol.

"So a lecturer (professor?)

The pay is 18/hr but Im not capped at 40 hours a week so I can work more to offset costs. \n Math Break Down\nSalary if working 40 hours a week- $34,560 \nCorrect me if I am wrong but actual earnings after Federal and State Taxes- $20,960 \n Im asking for advice because at the moment, Im more interested in finding a market research position because that is what I want to do in the future. Although, I do not have experience in this field but I will be working on projects at my volunteer work that may touch on this. \n Im torn right now, New York is an amazing place, my girlfriend and some of my friends are there. However, I dont just want to take this job because its the only one that has hired me. Now I understand the job market and I should be super excited but I have student loans to pay and if I leave the suburbs, Im on my own, parental support will be limited to phone calls, visits, and emergency situations only. \n I understand this is a lot to read but I really could use some advice.

"I graduated with a major in print-based graphic design in August and immediately had an offer from a small printing company, which I jumped on as hard as I could. After four days working there, I was told that I'd be on hold indefinitely because business had a sudden dropoff, and it was strongly hinted that I should start looking for something else. I decided to give it a month because I was told that historically, their business picks up around September, but of course, I never heard anything back. \n I've been on the job hunt ever since, and I've been growing more and more desperate. I've had a couple interviews, but no matter how good of an impression I leave, I'm always passed up. The only work experience I have are two unpaid internships which lasted a total of roughly five months combined. (I needed two internships to graduate as part of my program, and wouldn't have made it if it wasn't for either of them) On the bright side, they were both heavy hands-on design positions that gave me a lot of samples and published work, but still, it's not the most shining resume. \n I have the skills I'd need to do fantastically in most of the positions I'm applying for, and the internships, however short, gave me a lot of great experience that I milk every single ounce of for interviews, but it feels like I'm just underprepared for a true job search and that I'm crashing and burning right out of the gate. I can't help but harbor a bit of resentment towards the company that hired me then immediately let me go, because if I had that position, I would've been out of my parents' house and living on my own months ago, but I'm stuck in a small town that you have to drive an hour away from to get anywhere interesting, and it's killing me. \n I suppose this is getting a bit ranty, but that's just where I'm at right now.

I need some ideas on how to tackle this. I live in a 4-flat. The girl above me is the worst neighbor alive. She has guys over almost every single night, sometimes multiple guys at once, and I have to spend roughly 70% of my time at home listening to her get busy. Her bed must be about 100 years old, because it squeaks obnoxiously. Seriously, WD-40, bitch. In addition to that, this girls SCREAMS at the top of her lungs (fake ass faker), so essentially I'm listening to what sounds like a girl being beaten to death during an earthquake, ALL.NIGHT.LONG. \n Last night, I was woken up at 1AM (I'd just drifted off), and the grossness went on for so long that I had to fall asleep in my living room with the TV blasting. I finally got to go to my bedroom at about 5AM. I was woken again at 8AM, then AGAIN at 10:30AM. The only place I could sleep without being completely disturbed would be my kitchen, and yeah, NO. \n I know my other neighbors can hear it, because they've acknowledged it. The neighbor next to her has a disabled 10 year old child AND her elderly mother living with her, and their bedrooms touch Fuck Queen's apartment. The neighbor next to me is a middle aged man whose daughter comes to visit on the weekends. It's completely inappropriate for this girl to orgy out loudly at all hours every single night, knowing we can all hear her. \n Can't complain to management - they are the kind of people who collect your check in the mailbox and never, EVER speak to you. They've been told about her partying at all hours and her dogs that bark nonstop, and have never addressed it. So I need to be more head-on about it, but that is kind of the most awkward conversation in the world.

My father passed away seven months ago. I've been having a hard time coping since then, but I am doing better with each passing week. \n It seems my symptoms, if you could call them that, are an increased sensitivity to negative events - that is, my mood would noticeably worsen due to small things (such as something at work not working out perfectly or a phone call not getting me all the information I wanted), and also a much stronger response than before to these events - so basically, something which wouldn't bother me in the past now stays on my mind and saddens me, and also makes me so sad, I have a hard time carrying on with my day, or finding the initiative to do things I need, or things which would distract me. \n I think these two changes from the way I used to be are similar to allodynia and hyperalgesia - things which normally don't cause pain now do, and the sensation of pain is increased. \n I have been dealing with this in various ways, which mostly involve leaving work early to sit at home and watch YouTube videos, as a way to distract myself. Thinking about things rationally, my go-to coping method until this point in my life, is disappointingly ineffective. \n I wouldn't have sought help from outside, but I've started a new relationship two months ago, feeling that the brunt of dealing with my father's death was behind me. Now, however, my behavior is affecting my relationship and hurting my SO. I'm not looking for relationship advice and I know this isn't the place for that. \n Another way to describe it, is that bad experiences 'stick' in my mind for much longer, and make me less productive and more morose. \n I'm looking for any advice from anyone willing to offer it, on how I can stop feeling so bad if my SO says something unintentionally hurtful, or if I get a bad grade and suddenly have this sinking feeling that takes me out of commission for the entire day.	7 months after a loss, I get really sad from small things to an extent that's interfering with my life on a daily basis, and hurting my SO.

This might be a no brainer for some of you, but for me it's absolutely 50/50 and I can't decide. \n Behavioral Neuroscience or Theater? \n I'm female, 28 years old. Two kids (twins, 4 years old) \n I won't have to actually put my decision down on paper for another couple years, but in the meantime, I want to be able to do things that would help me get in the one I pick. For example... joining an acting group if I pick theater, or volunteering with developmentally challenged individuals if I pick BN. \n I have a son with Autism, and the BN degree would be awesome in that respect. It would open a lot of doors for me, career-wise. I don't see myself working with people with special needs, but that's a big one, and my views could change. Basically, I would be getting this degree to help my son, and also ... because science is beyond awesome and I love how this degree combines Psychology and Neuroscience. \n That being said, I've always DREAMED of being an actress, and I love theater and being able to express myself in different ways. It's also an outlet for me, as I am a heavy introvert, and acting has always pushed me to be more outgoing, friendly, and also to (not be afraid to) interact with people in ways I never would normally. I love singing, I love feelings, and being able to express them and make people watching feel what the character is feeling. It's an amazing experience. \n The downside to theater is that... I feel like it's the selfish option. I wouldn't be helping anyone, and I feel like helping people is something I want to do (so I've tried to rationalize it by trying to find ways that acting helps people... for instance, I might be able to help my son in the social aspect, as he has a hard time relating to people, or even acknowledging them) Also, I have little experience acting... I've been in a couple theater productions (Was the good witch in Wizard of Oz, which was a lot of fun) and I'm not even sure I would get in. But that's the reason I want to choose a major now, so that if I pick theater for instance, I can work towards being someone they would want to pick. \n Also, I'd be in my 30's when I start school, and would it really be worth it starting an acting career now? A lot of actors I admire started their careers a lot older than me. So I don't know... \n Anyway, this is already way longer than I thought it would be.	Behavioral Neuroscience because my son has Autism and I want to help him and other people, or Theater, because I love everything about it and it makes me feel good (and it could potentially help my son in other ways.)	445	40	needadvice
I've just recently switched my ISP from Century Link to Mediacom (both are terrible, I know, but that's all that's available where I live.)\nSome back story. We had Direct TV bundled with Century Link. To use the On Demand, or whatever Direct TV calls it, required internet speeds of at least 15mb/s. Century Link could only offer 3 mb/s in my area. So we decided to switch. What would be the point of paying for all those extra channels on Direct TV if we can't watch them due to the slow internet speeds? So Mediacom came today and installed all their tivos and routers, we're all set. Sitting at roughly 22 mb/s, when it wants to work (that's a story for another time)\nHop on the phone to call Century Link to cancel the internet. After about 45 minutes on the phone, the lady says that it's going to be a $360 cancellation fee.

"So after being hospitalized in January for a drunken suicide attempt, I decided to start fighting back against my condition. I went to the follow up appointment, and after that failed (couldn't see me for 2 months) I sought out my own doctors. Well, after getting hot potato-ed between 3 facilities and winding up right back where I started (now having bared my deepest darkest to complete strangers multiple times in a row), the clinician tasked with finding me outpatient treatment instead decided to put me in  another  crisis unit for a fucking week after misunderstanding something I said about a gun I don't own.

I'm a sophomore in college and I have a pretty sweet summer job as a camp counselor. It's a job I love with people and kids I love. It's great. So at the end of last summer I got involved with a guy that works there. I know it's stupid, don't date coworkers. But we dated for a while and in the end, he's graduated from college and I'm in the middle of it and it was just doomed to start. No issues. We moved on. \n Well there's this girl that was an issue while we were dating and was in the picture before I started talking to my ex and she became the last straw in the breakup. Well they both were so dead-set that they hated the other person saying they wanted nothing to do with the other and I believed them. Well turns out, to no one's surprise, they're now dating. And now I'm in a shitty position. \n My parents are moving from Colorado to Phoenix in May which means I've lost my place to live for the summer so I'm finding a place for myself. My parents are going to spend on housing about what I'll make this summer so they've offered to pay me that amount and me move to Phoenix for the summer, where it's 110 degrees and I know no one. However, I was really looking forward to the experience of being on my own since I only get to live in apartment my senior year because of the dorms and being forced to live in my sorority's house for 2 years with 50 other girls. \n I'm afraid if I return to camp it's going to be miserable.

Honestly, the only reason why I'm even bothering with college at this point is because I basically have a full ride thanks to a Prepaid Program + Scholarships. I'm more or less obligated to get at least a Bachelor's because of the investment my parents/grandparents made. \n But I'm not here to mope about that. I'm not really sure what I hope to gain, I'd just like an outside opinion. \n So one of the majors I'm considering switching to is something Education related. And then I've always had slight interest in Criminology, and I feel like it would also allow me to pursue more psychology related courses (Psychology would be my first choice in major if the job outlook for the major wasn't so bleak). Besides that, I'm looking into International Affairs, since I've always been really interested in politics, but not necessarily at the internal scale. IA is the newest consideration on my list, so I still need to research it a bit more; but it seems to be popular at my college, and I might give it more consideration if I decide that I want to go through with learning a third language or doing German as my minor (I've already done two courses in it already because of the degree requirements for CS). \n I'm going to be entering my second year this Fall, so I have plenty of wiggle room to fit into most of the major's I've looked into, I just might have to go a little over 120 credit hours since I had to do a couple of math prereqs that would be irrelevant in most of the majors I'm considering. \n As for why I'm leaving CS, I simply don't have any passion for it anymore, not to mention my math skills are nowhere near where they need to be. I've tried looking into elementary concepts behind programming, for instance, and nothing seems to hold my interest. There were only two reasons why I ever decided on the thing anyways; initially it was in a bid to achieve my childhood dream of being a video game developer, but even the passion there has died down almost completely with age. Alternatively, I always figured that it was a pretty wide-open major with a positive job outlook, but seeing as how I don't feel I can commit myself fully to the field, I don't think it would be the healthiest investment of my time. I'm not particularly interested in any of the other STEM majors for similar reasons. \n Of course, I know how it can seem showing all this concern about career outlooks when I put Education on the list, but honestly as far as that goes I just feel that it fits my personality the most, and it's pretty much tied with Criminology in how happy I think it would make me going onward (ignoring financial considerations). I'd actually prefer to teach the social sciences more than anything else, and the college I'm currently attending does have a Social Sciences Education program. I'm just wondering if something so specific would be advisable, or if I should just stick with something more general.

29yo Male, Getting married on 10/10 and I suck when it comes to deciding what to do with my hair. \n A year ago it was about 18 inches long because I just didn't know what to do with it.

I met this woman through the internet, we went out a few times, nothing came of it, no hard feelings; a few years later she gets in contact with me and after some discussion broaches the topic of sperm donation.  She's in her early 40s (I'm in my late 20s), she'd like to get pregnant while she's still fertile, and she'd like to do it with my sperm. Obviously I'm flattered, but I'm a little conflicted about the whole thing. All she wants is my genetic material; she's not interested in emotional support (which is great, as I have neither the life skills nor the desire to be a dad) or financial support (she makes much much more than I do).  It's not like we're close, so there's no relationship aspect to worry about preserving; for the purposes of the decision she might as well be a stranger. To clarify, she's not offering sex (which is tragic -- she's pretty hot). \n So, reddit, should I help this woman our with some semen or run away? Maybe one then the other?	to knock up or not?	180	5	needadvice
So I've found that I'm really into fantasy like Hobbit and Lion/Witch/Wardrobe but, especially in the case of the latter, they are mostly for children. I like the medieval fantasy style like Lord of the Rings, but don't have a clue as to what is out there. Actually, I've just listed everything I know. \n I don't really want a source to look about for this type of thing.

"Okay so I guess you can say I was the party animal in my group of friends. I'd be down to drink, club, smoke, stay out all night etc. I loved the fast paced life I was living.

He had different values then me and we constantly challenge each others beliefs. (He's religious and I have no set faith). Here I met a guy who wanted to get to know  ME , not get  inside  me.

"Hi Reddit. I live in a ""developing country"" and I am thinking of moving to the US to chase my dream. I have a nice job, loving parents, a beautiful girlfriend and all that. Except for some mistakes I've made in the past regarding my education you could say that my future is secured. The thing is I hate it, I'm not satisfied, I'm not motivated. Just thinking about this bleak future gets me depressed, which is why I want to run away. Everyone has taken all my life decisions for me. There's only one thing I've ever wanted to do in my entire life and that is something impossible for me to do in this country (which is why I've done everything halfheartedly in all my life). So suddenly a great chance has come up and I'm thinking of taking it, but to do so I would have to leave absolutely everything behind and start anew, on my own.

"Some background : My 13 year old daughter is a bit of a loner.  She likes horror movies, comics, manga, drawing, doing crafts, and video games.

So, I've been dealing with severe depression for the past 15 years or so, and it gets better and worse and better and worse as the months and years go by.  Right now it's not bad, but I'm unemployed and have no structure or social network in real life.  I have zero motivation... well, that's not quite right... I have some motivation and I know what I want to do and what I need to do to try to get things on track, but it's like my will is completely disintegrated.  I also have a whole lot of anxiety, mostly social anxiety.  My parents are supporting me right now.  That's been necessary off and on in the past when I've crashed, and I'm immensely grateful that they are able and willing, but now I feel like the only way I will EVER have any motivation to get my shit together, find a job, etc, etc, is if I have the real threats of homelessness and starvation to scare me straight.  I am a young adult, and somehow I managed to complete a college degree.  I'm just terrified of not having any support because it's inevitable that I will eventually crash again no matter what.  But if they don't cut me off, where can I find the will and motivation and energy to get it together?	young adult with mental illness, need motivation to pull myself up	225	11	needadvice

"Okay, here's a bit of background information: my mom was supposed to babysit two of her nephews today, but an old friend of her's from high school is back on the mainland for a short while (he owns condos in Hawaii), so she went with another friend to visit him; and forgot to let her sister know. \n Since I didn't have anything going on today until after they would be picked up, I decided to watch my cousins to save my aunt and uncle the trouble or scrambling for a new babysitter. The oldest of the two is pre-confirmation and one of his assignments is to do sermon reports, so it was suggested that I take them to church. \n Here's the kicker: I'm an atheist. Currently I have not open up to my family about it because I am still living and home during college and relying on aid from my parents, and I don't want to risk being disowned. So I respect their wishing and bring them to service. \n The one we attended has a contemporary service, which featured their own band. I always have my guitar with me, so in order to help keep myself focused on something other than the service I asked if I could accompany them today, and the accepted. While I may not agree with the message, the songs were fun to play and it was good practice. \n Afterwards, they invited me to play again if I wanted to. I've been trying to find people to play/jam with in my local area, but so far I've had no success.

So. I am predicted very high grades and I'm applying to the top universities for my degree. Lately I find that I'm increasingly skipping school, at least one day a week. A typical example would be today when I woke up late enough to have just missed my bus so I went back to sleep; the same happened again before my second class and then I simply decided I wouldn't go at all. \n Skipping became a habit of mine in 9th grade when I was bullied and also found everything fairly easy so thought there wouldn't be much harm in skipping the occasional day (and I was largely correct). Since I started in my current school, however, it has become much less frequent - maybe once in three weeks when I simply hadn't gotten much sleep. This makes me think the current situation is stress-related as I have tons of deadlines on top of university admissions stuff and I have been increasingly stressed lately. Another issue is sleep as I often find it hard to sleep and can quite easily sleep 12-14 hours a night. I feel like I can't really control my actions when I've just woken up. \n As mentioned I've been doing very well throughout school but I think my habit is finally starting to catch up with me and my teachers are starting to ask questions as well. It would be great if anyone had some pointers on how I could stop!	Excellent grades, stress, sleep issues, skipping school, help?	245	8	needadvice

This is a throwaway - gf is a redditor. I wasn't sure whether to post in /r/trees, /r/Relationship_Advice, etc. \n Not too long ago my gf took a trip to see some old friends. She joked about wanting to try smoking pot with them, which they are able to get. As it's illegal, and as we've been anti-drug, before she left I told her I didn't want her to, and trusted that she'd be respectful of my concerns. \n After she returned I didn't think to bring it up and didn't think any more about it until I learned from someone else recently that she had smoked with them several times when she was there. \n The problem here is that she has kept it a secret from me, and hasn't told me. It's a problem because it's a trust issue. If she's keeping this from me, what else is she keeping from me? It's illegal too so if she's arrested how do I explain to our kids? How can I then teach our kids that drugs are bad? \n I also learned that she thinks that once I try it then everything will be okay. The problem there is that I am the breadwinner - all other reasons aside, even if I do it, if my employer does a random drug test, I will lose my job. She's unemployed. If she paid for the pot, then it was from money that I earned for our family. \n I've also learned that she has considered growing it. \n I know there's going to be arguments for it being okay to smoke it. She's an adult, right? The effects are less than alcohol. The reasons for pot being illegal are stupid, etc.\nBottom line is that she's keeping secrets and putting our family's stability at risk, and it's breaking my heart. \n Here's where I need advice... \n At some point she may tell me that she's done this. I don't know how I should react. I'm numb right now, trying to think with a logical and clear head and not be emotional, but every day since I found out it's been bothering me. The first day I could not sleep for most of the night. I hated the fact that she was laid next to me and was keeping one or more secrets. \n Or if she doesn't tell me in the near future, should I bring it up? Should I reveal my source and blow the trust there? Should I wait until she talks about going to see these friends again so I can give her an opportunity to tell me firsthand? \n My entire life has been drug-free - it's how I was raised, and she knew this was important to me before we got together. \n Reddit, how should I react?

Hi Reddit.  Been wanting to post something for a while since joining up.  I've noticed that Redditors give pretty good advice, and I was just hoping for some insight on my situation here. \n I suppose some backstory would help here.  My girlfriend and I just recently moved into a 3 bedroom with 3 other friends of ours, and we're paying about 2800 a month.  Split between five people, it's not too bad.  Rent is about $600 apiece.  My girlfriend gets her rent money from refund checks from our school, as does two of my other roommates.  I have family helping me out at the time being, and the other roommate is the only one employed.  The rest of us are in school/looking for work. \n Now the interesting part is this.  My girlfriend's parents don't know she's living in this arrangement.  They are hardcore, Catholic Mexicans, and very traditional about their views and beliefs, one of which is that you shouldn't live with a boy till you've married him.  Now backwards thinking aside, we really can't let them know about this living situation.  Last week however, our school called her parents asking about refund methods, and now her parents have all her financial aid money.  We can't exactly tell them that we need it for rent, because they would totally flip out, disown her, beat her, etc. and I don't want that to happen.  For the moment, I told her the best thing to do was not to rock the boat with her parents.  The last thing we need is for them to overreact and pull her out of school when she's just on the brink of graduating.  Her parents are kinda irrational like that. \n I'm really out of ideas on how to get that 600 a month for the next 3 months.  We've been looking for work for a while now, and we've only been getting by on financial aid.  Are there any options that I haven't thought of/don't know about that you guys can enlighten me on?  I've told her to consider a small loan but we're already under a lot of student debt and I don't know if that would be the best idea. \n So please help a couple poor college students out.

Sorry for the long post. I really need some advice. I\u2019m in a 3-year relationship with the guy of my dreams. He is 21 years old and I am 20. Even though we are both pretty young, I can easily see myself spending the rest of my life with him. Apart from the occasional bickering that all couples do, we have a great relationship. \n My problem is this: over the past 6 months, there has been 4 occasions where my boyfriend has gotten out-of-control drunk. I was present for 3 of the times. The first time, as we walked back to campus, he insisted that campus was in the complete opposite direction and proceeded to run away. I had to have a friend drive me around looking for him; luckily, we picked him up a few blocks away from school. It then took me and 4 of my girlfriends to calm him down enough so that he would not run away and get lost again. \n The next time, we were at his uncle's farm that had many electric fences to keep the cows in certain pastures. Again, he drank too much and decided to run away. Everyone was very concerned that he was going to get lost (the farm was huge and very unfamiliar territory to us) or run into an electric fence. After we caught up with him, it took 2 men (including his sister\u2019s fianc\xe9) and 3 women (his sister, cousin, and me) to wrestle him into submission. \n Tonight, I picked my boyfriend up from the police station. He had been out for his friend\u2019s 21st birthday and blacked out. He called me to pick him up but could not communicate to me where he was. After driving around the city streets with my roommate for 2 hours, the police finally called me to come get him. He had run away from his group of friends at some point and got very lost in a pretty bad neighborhood. Luckily, the police picked him up and all they gave him was a lecture. \n What do I do about all this? I swore after the \u201cfarm incident\u201d that I would end our relationship if I had to go through that again. There is absolutely no communicating with my boyfriend when he gets this drunk; he has hurt many people and lost a few friends by acting this way. Additionally, the terror I feel when my boyfriend is wandering around the streets extremely intoxicated and combative is more than I can handle. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m overreacting or if this is a legitimate concern of mine. I don\u2019t know if I should insist he get help, tell him he needs to stop drinking, or leave him. I would really appreciate any advice you have.	My boyfriend gets extremely drunk and runs away Forrest Gump style, usually getting lost or putting himself in dangerous situations.	464	20	needadvice
Hi Reddit, this is my very first post, so if this is in the wrong section I am deeply sorry. \n I am a 20 year old college student, I lived in CA for most of my life but almost 2 years ago I moved to NC for a job/family problems. for the first few months I lived with my sister who had lived out here, working the entire time (from about April 09 to December 09) then I moved and started renting a room from a co-worker and did so until April 10. \n At this point I transferred my college credits from my first year of college in CA to ECU (east Carolina university) and attended the summer session so I lived on campus for about 2 months. After which I went to CA to visit came back stayed with my girlfriends family in NC and awaited the fall semester. I had applied for in state tuition as I had assumed I had all necessary requirements. However I was met with a rejection even after an appeal. \n I managed to pay for the fall semester through my savings a private loan and financial aid (my parents are in no way helping me financially and have not been since I moved to NC) However I don't believe I will be able to pay for it for spring semester when paying out of state tuition. \n My only option is to reapply for in state tuition and I was wondering if anyone on Reddit had any experience in doing this or could offer any help at all. just to give a little info my fall semester tuition totaled 12410(including housing and meal plan both of which I chose the cheapest) of which financial aid paid 5000 and the rest was out of pocket. \n I have a NC license, have a registered car in NC paid state and fed taxes here, am registered to vote and voted a few days ago. \n I am sorry for the length of the post just thought I would give as much info as possible. thank you in advance for any help given I do greatly appreciate it.

Before you start hounding me for advertising, I'm not. I actually was planning to sell them to two friends who have been asking me to help build them new(er) computers. The two systems are as follows: \n \n Phenom X3, Sapphire HD 4670 512MB, 2GB DDR2-667 (Integrated Sound, Video and Ethernet) \n Athlon II X2, Sapphire HD 4670, 2GB DDR2-800 (Integrated Sound, Video and Ethernet) \n \n They both have hard drives as well as power supplies to place inside of said machines. The desired uses for the computers they want are mostly WoW and Starcraft 2, which both of these systems are more than enough to do so. The Athlon II can play Dead Rising 2 somewhat well on lower settings so I know the Phenom could too. I would have liked to CF the 4670s(to save me having to buy a video card) and sell them the systems for even less without video cards but the HD3300s on the motherboards give less than stellar performance in SC2 even on lower settings, so the 4670s are going as well. \n I want to accomplish two goals by selling them. \n \n Be able to cover most of the costs of a budget build for me come Black Friday \n Give them the systems for as low as I can afford to. \n \n Right now I gave one of them an Athlon 64, Ti4200 and 1Gb of DDR RAM. The other one already had a similar system except no video card so I gave him a Radeon 9600 to place in it. They can play WoW on those but only at lower graphic settings and with just above average frame rates. \n I know enough about building systems but maybe not so much about buying them. Last year was the first time I ever bought anything online so maybe some of you could tell me what I could expect to see deal wise this year as well as a suggested price to sell to them for. Lower is better but again I still have to be able to get enough out of this to help get me a 2010 budget build as well.	I want to sell the two above mention systems to two friends for as little as possible while still being able to use the combined returns to fund a large chunk of my 2010 black friday budget build because neither of us 3 are rich.	352	45	needadvice
"I've never submitted anything to reddit like this, but I've seen plenty of similar questions and figured I might get some good ideas.... \n Back story: My wife and I have lived in the same apartment building for the last 5 years or so, our apartment is the entire 2nd floor of the building and the other 3 are on the ground level. People have constantly moved in and out of apartment #3 and #4 but apartment #1 has had the same middle aged alcoholic woman since we've been there. Our landlord also owns the two story house next door and rents it to a woman that has two kids. \n The neighbor problems come from apartment #1 and the house next door. \n The woman in apartment #1 goes to the bar every night and comes home around 3AM every morning and either has a loud group of drunks with her or some random guy. Throughout the years her random boyfriends have smashed out her front window (right now her window is made of styrofoam), kicked in her door, beaten her, stood outside her door screaming at 4AM and long list of other ridiculous shit.. We've called the cops multiple times, they've come about 9 times in the last 3 years and usually they just ""talk to her"" or they arrest the guy that's beating her or whatever. Our landlord is fully aware of this but will not evict her and the cops don't show up half the time and when they do it takes 2-3 hours after we call. They're obviously sick of coming out here. \n The woman next door with the two kids didn't bother us until the last year - it seems like the mother is never there in the last 3 months and now she has two teenage gangsta-wannabe kids (I live in Montana so this is laughable) free to do whatever they like. They've started having huge groups of their friends hanging out in front of the two buildings - sitting on our porch, throwing garbage in our yard and in our mailbox (???), accumulating a massive pile of spit on our front porch, making snide/rude comments to us as we walk into our apartment among other things. \n In this last two or three weeks there have been huge parties of under aged kids at this house and now they've started partying WITH the woman in apartment #1. We called the cops and they didn't show up for an hour and half and everybody had left by then. Again, we've told our landlord and he has done nothing but ""talked to their parents"". About a week ago my wife told a group of kids to get off our porch and since then we've woken up and found our car tail light broken, the door on the gas tank open (who knows what they were doing) and yet more garbage piled up on our porch and in our mailbox. \n The idea of fucking with them/revenge of some sort sounds nice but that will likely just make things worse. The only thing I can think of is calling child protective services but I have my doubt that they would do anything. \n Is there any other kind of legal action/complaint/report I can file against these people to make this bullshit stop?"	What do you do about loud noise/underage parties/domestic disturbance and completely disrespectful neighbors when the cops and the landlord won't do anything about it? Moving seems like the obvious answer, but that's easier said than done.	551	36	needadvice
Alright, so this is some background information on my family, which consists of my mother, my brother, and myself.  We've lived in a one-bedroom studio apartment all my life, and we've always been content.  Unfortunately, my brother ended up getting a girlfriend, which naturally isn't a bad thing, unless she's an over-bearing one.  So after a year or so my brother and his girlfriend end up bringing two adorable puppies to the apartment.  We've had a small dog before, but we had to give him away because no one would be home to take care of him.  I know, we shouldn't have any dogs in such a small apartment, but we managed.  During the first few weeks the puppies peed and pooped everywhere, but my brother and his girlfriend would clean the floor and try to train the puppies.  Fast-forward to the present, and the situation is unbearable.  First of all, my brother and his girlfriend allow the urine to soak into the wooden floor of the bedroom and the poop to dry out in the kitchen.  The puppies only poop in the kitchen, but they pee everywhere.  At this point they should be trained only to do their business on newspapers in the kitchen, but they're not.  My brother doesn't clean.  His girlfriend doesn't clean.  Guess who ends up having to do it? The only person with a job, my mom.  She doesn't deserve this, and since I'm dorming away and only visit once a week, I can't handle all the cleaning.  Imagine working from noon to 9, getting home at 10, and having to clean shit and urine from the floors.  My brother, 21, and I have been positively spoiled by our mom, but he still acts like a child.  I have told my mom to throw his lazy ass out of the apartment, but this is something she claims is unable to do out of love.  She instead plans on telling him that if he does not get rid of these dogs then she'll move out and he'll have to pay the rent.  What? Why does she have to move out?  She also wants to secretly get rid of the dogs, but knowing my brother he'll probably freak out and try to get them back.  What should we do?\nAll my mom wants is to come home to a clean apartment.  Not one where you can smell the poop the second you walk in.	My mom is emotionally distraught at my brother's refusal to do something, anything, about his untrained puppies, who pee and poop everything.	407	22	needadvice
Here is a little background. My friend is going to be leaving by the end of the month to go to Israel. I don\u2019t know when the next time we will see each other but I want to send him off after having a grand night on the town. His house was the normal hang out and spend many hours playing Halo 2 in his basement. I just trying to figure what would be consider epic enough for the night. \n Important Information: 1. He is leaving before Halloween. 2. Because of Shabbat, Friday and Saturday morning we won\u2019t be able to do anything. So we are limited to Saturday night and Sunday. 3. My friends can pool money but probably no more than 400 or 500 bucks. 4. Area that we would be in is east Pennsylvania.

She's basically concerned with the possibility of having a horrible party and everyone hates it.

My wife is a personal shopper/personal stylist for a fairly high-end chain department store.  We live in a large metropolitan area in the US.   The customers that visit the store pay no additional charge for using a personal stylist. Their cost is the same as anyone else purchasing product, they just get to have someone help them pick out looks and throw together outfits, etc.  Her compensation is straight commission (% of gross) and she currently gets customers in one of three ways: \n 1- Someone calls into the store wanting to be set up with a stylist and she's available;  2- She takes walk up customers during times when she doesn't have appointments; and 3- Her repeat customers, referrals, or people she knows call her up and book an appointment. \n Types 1 and 2 have been in the toilet lately, and I'm trying to find ways that I can help her build up number 3.  Does anyone have any ideas of how I can use the interwebs, or local organizations, creative marketing tactics of any kind, or anything else out of the ordinary to help her build a customer base?  I'm looking for creative things that will lead to something, and I'm willing to put in some work.  Just looking for things I haven't thought of and knew reddit might have some creative ideas.	How can I help my wife find more customers to buy somewhat expensive clothes? \n Thanks a ton everyone.	224	18	needadvice

My friend (lets call her Amanda) is in a pretty deep hole right now and I dont really know what to tell her at this point. She's in Texas fyi. \n She was laid off several months ago and has been receiving unemployment that doesn't quite cover her bills. They also put some kind of hold recently on her payments so now she doesn't have rent. No idea how long that will take to clear up. She also owes me a couple months worth of car insurance (meh) and owes another guy for her small car loan payments. Her credit sucks (lots of debt) so she doesn't have credit cards or anything to fall back on. \n She was on probation for a fairly minor crime from when she was 16 (she's 21 now) and once she had already paid it off and served the time, whoever handles it decided that she didn't think she had learned her lesson (ridiculous) so she extended the probation/fees. Obviously Amanda didn't have the money to pay so it slipped into a warrant. \n Just recently she got a speeding ticket in a school zone. Close to double the limit (stupid yeah.) Cop was nice enough to not haul her off to jail for her warrant. She had a few traffic tickets she got deferred ajudication on a couple months ago which she's just breached with her new ticket to add to that. \n She's been trying to go to community college and received a couple grand in financial aid to assist that, but if she were to get stuck in jail from her warrant or something else causes her to miss classes (she doesn't even have gas money right now to get there) she's probably going to have to withdraw or fail and immediately owe back all the aid money. \n I know she got herself into this mess. She hasn't had luck with getting a job (graphic designer.) I just feel really bad to be stuck on the sideline watching her getting deeper and deeper into this financial/legal mess. Her mom passed away a long time ago and her dad barely gets by himself. Not really any other family available. \n The only thing I can think to recommend to her is to join one of the military branches. Is this a good idea? Do they do hair follicle tests? (she uses weed off and on for her depression right now). What other options if any could she have?

Yesterday my mother approached me and, with a very worried look on her face, told me that I had to have a talk with my younger brother(I am twenty-two).  Apperently he is dating a fourteen year old and by the looks of it she is VERY into him. We both grew up without a strong father figure seeing as our parents divorced a while back and we lack a really strong relationship with our dad. So because of that fact the responsibility has fallen on me to guide this raging hormonial beast. \n I kind of don\u2019t know where to start. I havent really fufilled the guiding big brother role(something I regret) and we are sort of distant from each other.  I don\u2019t want to make a big thing of it but I do believe that this is important for him as I can recall my high school years and how valuable it would have been for someone to at least open a dialogue with me. \n My mother is religious and of course wants me to discourage my brother from having sex till he is 49 or whatever age she thinks is appropriate. She was also against my idea about giving him some condoms, thinking that it would put in his mind that we are giving him permission to have sex. I have different views of course. \n So I come to you reddit and ask for any tips and advice you would be willing to share. Any stories recounting the advice you got would also be very much appreciated.	Need to give my bro the birds and the bees speech. Need some fucking help.	258	15	needadvice
"I graduated from a top 20 public university two years ago. After that, I moved to NYC and took a job as a consultant at a fairly large and popular firm. I make almost 6 figures, which is good considering the economy and my lack of experience, but given the cost of living it is not incredible. I also have full benefits, company credit card, phone, laptops (I have 3 computers). In addition, I am fairly good at this job. Actually, I am really good at this job. If I stuck with it I would have no problem clearing a large 6 figure check down the road.\nThe problem is, I do not wake up every Monday morning and say to myself, damn, I am excited to go to work today. The people I work with are mundane and I am more intelligent than a lot of them.

It has its positives such as I was able to further my relationship with my girlfriend, and indulge in things I love like brazilian jiu jitsu, etc. In addition, I live in a pretty cool city.

Last night I started having stomach pains present in the whole center abdominal area. At first, I had to walk leaning forward (like me grandma) because of the pain. It got worse to where even curled up in a ball did not help. I was writhing in pain. Took a couple of painkillers, still didn't work. I finally go to sleep only to wake up 3-4 hrs later with the excruciating pain again.

"My mother has been in a downward spiral for several years now, and I really hope she has hit her bottom. She is addicted to prescription pills, is a borderline hoarder, hasn't had a job in well over 10 years, has 8 cats she can't afford, and must leave her house in 60 days. \n There is a lot of backstory - including a dysfunctional relationship with her mother (who is now 96 and has financially supported her for at least 10 years); sexual abuse as a child; pregnancy and birth at 17 years old (my sister); multiple, unhealthy relationships with men; drug and alcohol abuse; the death of the one good man in her life (who literally died in her arms) almost 20 years ago... and the straw that ended up breaking the camel's back was witnessing one of her cats get ripped apart by her neighbor's dogs. She literally had a break with reality at that point and has yet to recover. \n Her house smells like cat urine, there is shit literally everywhere, and she has to be out in 60 days. This is in many ways a really good thing - there are too many bad memories there, and the bottom line is she cannot afford it anymore. On a very positive note, the owner of the house next door to her has bought her house, almost sight unseen, for his son. He is paying her $5,000 and is taking over her mortgage. Not only that, but her cousin has opened up her home for my mom to come live with her. This is all really, really good. \n What's not good is that part about her being a borderline hoarder and having so many cats. The death of the kitty killed by the neighbor dogs made her suicidal, which she has been for almost 2 years now. And now she has to find a home or shelter for at least 4 of the cats she has now. All of the no-kill shelters we have contacted are full, and no rescues are accepting. My fear is what will happen when she the inevitable arrives - sending these cats to shelters that will likely have to euthanize them. \n I am the one ""normal"" person in my family, and I carry the weight of all this like it's the weight of the world. I also get caught in the middle between my uncle, my grandmother, and my sister who offer mostly criticism of my mom and not a lot else. \n I have already been to her house to help her sort and pack things, and it's like a never-ending pile of crap, covered in cat urine. I have called shelters, sent emails, asked friends, etc, to help with the cat situation. I have checked into hoarding clean up services, but they are so expensive and money is tight. So far I have not found any non-profits that might have volunteers for this sort of thing. (We\u2019re in the Atlanta area, btw). \n I know I can't and shouldn\u2019t fix all of this for her, but it's really hard and emotionally draining to see her like this, and it is affecting me. I do see a therapist, and I got my mom to see a counselor a few times as well, but I'm very afraid of what the next 60 days will bring. \n Has anyone else out there been in this position?

Note: I'm going to school for Interior Design. As of now I have (collectively) 3+ years experience working in the field and will be graduating next Spring. \n I guess a little backstory would be beneficial to start with, so here it goes... \n I began working in the field my last semester of community college. After my Grandfather passed I made it my mission to put myself out there and succeed, something he instilled in me. \n I landed my very first interview as an intern and worked there for 7 months before moving on. I couldn't afford to work there during school because I made $8.50 an hour and that wasn't feasible for me. Over the years since I've worked 4 more jobs within my field before landing my current position. \n I was hired as a Kitchen and Bath Design ASSISTANT with potential for growth. I was hired on the spot and offered $13.00/hour (which is fair as an assistant). I've made more, but settled because the experience was worth it for me. Well, they did not expect me to catch on as quickly as I did and it took them all by surprise. By month 3, I was assisting on measures, designing kitchens/bathrooms, assisting customers in the showroom and handling quotes. You name it, I was doing it. \n By month 6 I asked for a raise since my boss said we could revisit. I asked for $15.00 and was shut down. He said they could not afford $15.00 and could only afford $14.00. He said he had big plans for the future of the company and hoped I would stick around for it. I wasn't happy considering I felt I was being underpaid for the amount of work I do, but decided to stay anyway. Why? \n My manager/partner. She is incredible. She has taught me so much, she trusts me with responsibility and she treats me like an equal. We work incredibly well together and I could not have asked for a better mentor and friend. \n So it's been 7 months since my last talk with the boss man and I'm doing even more now. I handle my own set of clients, start designs for my manager and assist in sending out plans for quotes, etc. We just got back from a business trip for one of the lines we carry as well and that was incredible. \n I've been with this company for a little over a year now. I love my job and I really found my niche in this industry, but I can't help but feel stuck. I feel I deserve more than what I'm making right now. He told my manager that there's a full-time design position waiting for me when I graduate. I know she speaks highly of me to him as well. \n I want to schedule another meeting with him and ask for another raise, but I'm afraid of the outcome. \n I need to know if I'm in the wrong for thinking I deserve more, or if I'm right and very underpaid for the responsibilities I have. If that's the case I need to find the strength to leave. I'm scared because I still have 8 months of school left and it's difficult finding another K&B design job that's flexible in the meantime. I also don't want to leave my awesome partner... \n So that's my dilemma. I really need some advice on what to do and if my concerns are justified. \n Thanks in advance!	I feel I'm underpaid, but want to assure my feelings are justified before I move forward.	579	16	needadvice

Upon turning onto the ramp my cars tires started sliding and ABS kicked in, however there was no traction whatsoever.  the car went down the ramp with the e-brake on and continued to pick up speed.  it crashed into the fence at the bottom of the ramp and the bumper cracked and popped off. \n i went to the management office about 10 minutes after i moved the car.  they informed me ""they knew of the icy ramp and will get to it in the morning""  this was at 6:50pm \n i am about to call the management office to speak to the person in charge about the neglect to their property.  I am in the mindset that because of their neglect and knowing about the icy conditions from previous complaints i should not be responsible for paying for the repair."	parking garage was a sheet of ice, and my gf's car slid down the ramp into a fence.  management knew about the conditions and weren't going to do anything to fix it until the morning.	188	35	needadvice
So, about 4 or 5 months ago, I drove across the country to be with my (now) husband. I drove from Portland, Oregon to a little town in Illinois, just outside St. Louis. \n When I left Portland, it was hard. I love that city a ton, and I always felt attached to it unlike anywhere else I'd lived. (I moved around a lot as a kid. We finally settled in Portland in seventh grade.) But I was on the cusp of homelessness/joblessness, and the rent was too damn high. Still, I loved my city to death, and it was hard to leave it. \n So, when I finally realised that I wouldn't be able to survive there anymore, I packed my things into my tiny 1984 Volvo, and drove to Illinois over the course of three days. \n I'm now living in Illinois with my loving husband and I have a job that I actually really love. I'm living comfortably (for the most part) and I know that I did the right thing in moving here. But I still feel terribly homesick. \n I have no friends or family here, aside from my husband. I've tried making friends, but I don't really get along with a lot of the people here. Its hard to find female friends that have the same interests as I do, or that don't think I'm a total weirdo. (I read comics and own two rats. I might as well be an alien to the girls I've met.) \n And, what makes it worse, is that I see reminders of Portland all over reddit. I spend a lot of my time on reddit, if I'm not gaming, and I do love it. But it seems there are a lot of Portlanders that frequent this site. (The Portland subreddit has 2,000+ redditors. St. Louis just has a few hundred.) But every time I see someone mentioning that they are from portland, its like a smack to the face, and I have to exit the page to try and forget about it, because it hurts  that  bad, remembering all my friends, family, precious food carts, and uniqueness that I left behind in portland. \n My husband and I are saving up to visit portland, and we were supposed to make it during christmas. But, as you can see, that didn't work out. Its going to be very hard this year to spend the holidays without my family. I'll likely be working. (My husband hates Christmas. So he's not big on celebrating it.) \n On top of that, my cousin is getting married in Febuary, and we're trying desperatly to save up money to get there. I've been taking on overtime, and we've cut our eating habits back a bit, as well as other frivolities. However, there is a LOT of work my car needs done. (New tires, new alignment, new belts, breaks, ect...) And I'm worried that we'll have to spend the savings on my car, and miss my cousin's wedding. If thats the case, we won't be able to go until next fall, because in the spring and summer I'm taking classes at the community college, and during my break between spring/summer I'm visiting my dad whom I haven't seen in three years. \n Waiting that long to go home would kill me. I'm already starting to feel depressed and terribly homesick as it is. And its only been five months. \n This was more of a rant/ramble than anything else, but any encouraging words or suggestions you can share on the matter would be greatly appreciated.	Moved away from Portland, OR a few months ago to Illinois. Incredibly homesick, and don't know how to deal with it. Prospect of making it to cousin's wedding in feb. is looking worse and worse. How to make missing home not hurt so much?	592	44	needadvice
"Like the title says: I feel almost entirely purposeless. I'm a 21 year old guy living in Michigan, working retail third shift slightly less than full time and spending my nights off just sitting up all night on my computer. When I was in high school, I always figured I'd go to college immediately afterward, studying Web design as I'd taken some classes on it in high school and enjoyed it. It didn't take long for me to get lazy and bored, though- a few weeks into my general education classes, none of which contained anything I was even vaguely interested in, I just stopped going altogether, mainly due to boredom and the knowledge that, for once, nobody cared if I was in school or not. That was four years ago. Now I've spent the last two years working this job, living first with family and now with friends in an apartment half a mile from the store I work at- I don't have a car, which is another obstacle, but luckily I'm close enough to just walk to and from work. I've spent the past two years just working, nothing else- I had planned to go to college while living with the aforementioned family in a different city, but they ended up moving away, putting the kibosh on that plan. I really, really want to go to college- I want to learn something useful, something that will get me a job that pays more than retail, something that doesn't make me feel like I'm just spinning my wheels here. \n The problem? I don't know what I want to do.  At all.  For the past few years I've thought I want to do something involving computers, since they've always been an interest and hobby of mine, but now even that's starting to change. It's not that I don't want to do anything, either- I look at the list of programs at the local college and think ""yeah, I could probably do that and be relatively happy"" for several of them, mostly involving technology in some way, though not all of them. All I really care about is that whatever I do is tolerable and pays well enough to live on, and I'm able to do it without much difficulty. Things are so open-ended here I don't even know where to start, partly because most of the things I'm interested in, I have zero experience with and just think they sound interesting. I don't know if I want to stick to my original incredibly vague plan of ""something involving computers"" like networking, take a more trade-oriented route like electronic technology, or go another way entirely. I can't help but think maybe my standards are too low- that I'll jump at any low-hanging fruit- but I feel like I have to do  something."	I want to go back to college and study something to get ahead in life but cannot for the life of me figure out what.	471	25	needadvice
Hello, I graduated from college a few days ago in a field I don't ever want to pursue. (Business, finance & insurance to be exact) I come from an upper middle class family and have two workaholics as parents. After graduating from high school I was pretty much forced into college. Originally I wanted to do something with computers since I spend a good part of my free time on them ( Video games, movies, shows,.. ) , am pretty tech savvy and am an incredible fast learner anything computer wise. I was looking into things like video & movie editing, website developer/designer, system admin,..... But since I never actually did any programming, and was told by everyone around me that every profession with computers required me to be good at math, and apparently no money to be made in video & movie editing, I gave that up. ( Still not sure if these are actually true ) \n My parents were very proud of me being the first in the family to go to college and wanted me to waste no time. I wasn't given any time to figure out what I actually wanted and picked this major a few days before the deadline. Looking back, I probably should've stood up to my parents and told them I needed time to make up my mind. But I was an 18 year old kid, ignorant and stupid. Turns out it was probably the worst decision of my life. 2 years in I knew I wasn't interested in the subject at all, but I guessed I would manage. How many people are actually happy with their job after all? And dropping out 2 years in would probably get me kicked out from home.  So I decided to stick it out. \n A year later, during my internship, it was clear to me that there was no way I would ever do this as my job. All day every day I was doing brainless work. Entering & saving data, making some phone calls and reading & organizing documents. The work I did all day made me miserable, depressed and even suicidal. The insanely competitive atmosphere and questionable business ethics didn't help either. After my internship I refused my job offer and now here I am. \n My parents expect me to start looking for a job at a respected firm in a few days. Work 60+ hours doing the same things like during my internship, have no social life & earn lots of money. If I follow this route I will probably end up killing myself. It\u2019s just not who I am.  My dad will be furious when I eventually tell him that I don\u2019t want any job in this field whatsoever and wasted 4 years. Chances are that he will throw me out.  On top of that my dad paid for my entire education, being European it's still  several thousand euros. I've been thinking about doing a different major, but i'm not sure how my parents would react to it. Neither do I know what major would fit me the most nor how I would feel about being 22 and starting college all over again.\nI need some serious advice on what I should do as it will probably determine a big part of my future & life.	Being a stupid 18 year old I picked a random major. Turns out I can\u2019t stand it & never want to work in this field ever again. When I tell this to my parents I will probably be thrown out of the house.	554	43	needadvice
Ok, so. I'm a college student with one year left of school. When I first started college for some reason (honestly I have no clue why now) I got a credit card despite that everyone always tells you not to if you can't handle one. I thought I could; I couldn't. \n So here I am, nearly 3 years later barely being able to afford basic things I need like food, gas, and other living expenses. I racked up probably around $5,000 dollars in debt, which may not seem like a whole ton, but as a college student who makes ~$500 dollars a month, it is. I realize what a huge mistake I made, and haven't used them in over a year and a half, but I stopped working 2 jobs during the semester to focus on my last couple years of school and now I'm struggling to make even minimum payments. My situation might be a little better off if this was at least all on one card, but it's spread across 4 of them (I'm such an idiot!), one with a larger amount and the rest all under $1,000. \n So what can I do? I fully intend to pay these blasted things off, once I'm out of school and have a real job (or any job that I can work more than 16 hrs a week) it wouldn't be so bad. I still have another year left of school. I'm hoping to get a decent internship this summer that would help me make some money, but if that falls through I'll be stuck with a couple minimum wage jobs because the city I live in (Erie, PA) has the most god awful job market even when the economy isn't crashing. How screwed am I? Is there ANYTHING I can do?	I was an idiot a couple years ago with credit cards and now I'm screwed.	301	15	needadvice
"Hi. I'm twenty years old and my entire life I've looked forward to heading off to college and leaving the nest. Long story short I didn't take all the classes in high school that most ( all ) universities require. Specifically I'm missing a second spanish class and 2 or 3 math classes (I have a severe weakness in mathematics). So needless to say I wasn't accepted any where. At all. Even the ""pssshhh they'll let ANYONE in that school"" schools. So I'm stuck in rural North Carolina scooping ice cream for $9 an hour. I feel like I'm fairly intelligent, well spoken and polite. I feel like I would make a nice addition to some university's starting pool of freshmen. I want to go off to college and live the life I always thought I would and live the whole 'college experience.' On top of all this I have almost no friends, my 2 best friends are stoners and have no qualms about knowing they are going absolutely no where. They're great friends they just like weed wayyy too much (I have to stand out side the astro-van when they smoke). Out side of those 2 friends I have no one else. All the friends I had in high school (not that I had many) moved onto college (except the 2 stoners of course). I just broke up with my girl friend /best friend/only person I could talk to/everything to me  of 2 years. She had a lot of mental and emotional problems and when she was ok she was amazing, I loved every little detail about her. Everything. But when she got into her (let's call them episodes) she would scream and hit herself or me and break things. She was 2 completely different people. After her 'episodes' she would usually cry and apologize and I would hug her and tell her ""it's ok"" and try to take care of her as much as I could. Oh yeah and she cheated on me. Oh yeah and she fucked some one else just days after we broke up. I loved her when she was fat and didn't say anything when people asked how she lost so much weight when I knew it was because she didn't eat for 6 months and threw up anything she did eat. I know the break up was for the best but I'm unbelievably co-dependent on her and I don't know how I'll get over her. \n I just feel like I'm drowning and I want to break the surface so bad but I don't know how. \n So my question to you is how can I jump-start my life, some how get into college, meet more people and get over the terror that is my ex-girlfriend?"	I'm twenty years old and seemingly going no where and I don't know how to change that.	461	17	needadvice
"I'd post this in /r/SuicideWatch, but I'm not suicidal and they tend to give optimistic happy-go-lucky advice anyway. You are my last hope, as I don't have anyone left to talk to. \n I am a 20 year student in Serbia. I'm stating my country because it's relevant for cultural reasons. \n To give you some background, I was and still am, depressed since I was 15 or 16. After therapists and a visit to a psych ward my parents and everyone around me decided it was time to stop caring about it. Needless to say, I'm not exactly cured.\nI come from a small village where I never fit in. During high school I was bullied and I pretty literally had no friends. A lot of people I talked to find this hard to believe but it really was that way. As a result, I barely have any confidence and I'm shy and fearful of other people. I feel like I have to constantly prove myself and entertain them or try and elicit pity out of them. During those years back home I met online friends and I became more part of a western society than my own. \n I had hoped that once I get to Belgrade, things would fall into place. They haven't. My second semester is ending on Friday and during all this time, I made no friends and I attended zero parties. And it's not like I didn't try. I read websites on how to be more social and outgoing, I took advice. But it seems the very fabric of this society is against me. I don't think that it's possible to actually form friendships if you didn't have friends in high school. I found out that this is how it works here, people from Belgrade already have friends and they don't care to meet anyone new unless it's through an existing friend. People who come from out of town meet friends in their dorms. And those who do not qualify for them, like me, just go back home every weekend to hang out with their existing friends. \n I wanted to have a social life. I'm really lonely and depressed and it hinders my motivation. I can barely study, and I am thinking of dropping out. I'm not even sure anymore if I want to study. Perhaps it's just not for me. I can barely keep my shit together, I miss deadlines, I can't bring myself to attend class sometimes. I do know that  sociology interests me, but I wonder it that's reason enough to study it.  But if I go back home, I'm looking at working class life, no friends, and just the internet and drugs to numb me.  I wanted all this work, but it just doesn't. I can't seem to form any friendships here. People talk to me at uni, I sometimes go for a drink or coffee with them, we go see a movie from time to time, but no one invites me to any parties or to go out. Because they already have a ""crew"" and I'm not part of it. I no social capital to offer to people. All I can do is talk. \n So, as far as advice goes. Do you think I should just go back home and stop trying? I wanted a social life and an education from this place, and at least as far as I'm concerned those two things are contingent (especially when you're studying sociology). I know people might just say I should focus on education only but it doesn't work that way, even Fromm said so, one of the basic human needs is the need to belong somewhere. And right now I don't."

Hey reddit, I made a throwaway account for this one. I am in need of your advice. \n Here's the story: A friend of mine, lets call her Erica, has had her share of bad relationships in the past. Recently (about 6 months ago), she got together with a guy, lets call him Stan, and after a few months decided that Stan wasn't right for her, so she left him. Stan was pretty broken hearted, and made a big scene in public the day they broke up, calling her names loudly etc. \n Fast forward to a couple days ago. I notice Erica is pretty scarce on the internets (she's usually on almost everyday, and I talk to her on Facebook, msn etc) and she hasn't been calling either. I text her to ask her if everything is ok, and she tell's me that she got back together with Stan. \n I ask her why, because I know that she didn't like him any more and it's unlikely that she would get back together with him, and she then tells me that Stan obtained some pics of her and her ex-boyfriend (Who she was with before Stan), and threatened her to send them to everyone she knows and basically ruin her life if she doesn't be his girlfriend. He says that someone 'anonymously emailed them to him', but I don't buy that. She agreed to be with him hoping that she could probably get a chance to delete the pictures or convince him to delete them. \n This guy is a complete nutcase, and is holding basically keeping her in a relationship under duress. She doesn't want to be with him, but she doesn't want her life ruined by him sending her pics of her having sex with her ex-bf (not even him!) to all her friends and family. I'd like to help her out, but I honestly feel like this guy is holding all the trump cards, and there isn't much Erica or I, or anyone else can do until he decides to let her go, or delete the pictures.	My friend's psycho ex-bf threatened to send nudes of her to her friends and family if she doesn't get back together with him, and she is now in a relationship she doesn't want to be in, and can't leave because he will ruin her life. \n Please reddit, give me some advice.	347	51	needadvice
I didn't want to go to college in the first place. I left school at 17 because I was sick of it and I wanted to go and work for a year or so and then head off to college when I had some idea of what I wanted to do with my life. Instead my mother pressured me very hard to enrol in our local community college straight away. Her reasoning was that she waited until late in her life to get a degree and she regrets it. \n I picked computer science to study because I couldn't think of anything else that might interest me and pretty early on I realised I hated the subject. Pretty soon I started skipping classes and putting 0 effort into assignments. I passed the first year with As and Bs, second with Bs and Cs, and only barely scraped through the first semester of my third year. \n At one point I decided I'd had enough and wanted to try and get out of there with a two-year diploma, but when I brought that up with my mother there were tears and tantrums and she used every guilt trip and threat in the book.  To avoid conflict I just gave up and enrolled for my third year. \n Long story short, I failed my final semester. I took a semester off and just worked part time at a supermarket (they wouldn't give me fulltime hours), and now my mother is pressuring me to go back and finish. I don't want to. \n I have hardly any money, no real world experience, and no idea what to do. I want to just move out and work at a call center or something for a while, but when I mentioned that to my mother I got the tears and the guilt trips again. I'll probably want to finish what I started at some point in the future but I'd rather do that because I want to rather than because I feel forced.	I failed my last semester of college and don't want to go back. I live at home and my mother is pressuring me to go back. What should I do? Should I suck it up and repeat the last semester or should I stop being a complete baby and move out?	334	51	needadvice
"This is not a shady company, but one of the leaders in home education, for which I work as a freelance teacher. They send me students that fit my profile (secondary schools maths, physics), and I get paid 48% of what they charge the families. \n But now they have started a new strategy, in which I am invited to participate. If accept, I would be paid 50% of the revenues, plus 30% of the remaining margins. What margins are these? I will explain: I must find and hire at least 3 more teachers that would work under my supervision and responsibility, but the company would continue to look for students and paying everyone, in addition of all the paperwork. They (the teachers under my control) will get the 50% like me, but from the other fifty, I take the 30% from all classes taught by them. However, these teachers must also find and hire a minimum of 3 teachers, like me. This is a pyramid from which I, at the summit, get diminishing returns from all levels under my control. But if they fail or I do not succeed to maintain a minimum of 3 working teachers, I lose that the status and I return to the 48% standard. \n I do not have to take risks or to invest my money, but this is a classic pyramid, designed to fail after a few months, when the base teachers are unable to find his three extra teachers, or is impossible to find students for everyone. \n What should I do? if I do not accept, I can continue with my usual contract, but I fear that the new arriving students will be diverted to ""more involved"" teachers. \n Note: I know I would be at the summit because I am invited directly by the director of the company, not by another teacher. \n Note 2: And I really can not understand why a working, profit-making company, has implemented this strategy. \n Note 3: I am sorry for my bad, bad english."	a company I work for has decided to implement what basically is a pyramid scheme.

So I recently moved in to a new place in DC with this guy I met on a roommate site. On most matters he is actually pretty good. Only sort of minor issues actually living with him. Which I feel like is to be expected when you room with someone you never met before. \n We both like to out to the bars and have a good time, sometimes together sometimes with our respective groups of friends. However, he has a fairly annoying/probably unsafe habit of when he gets drunk he wanders off. As in like he wakes up places and has no idea how he got there - sometimes just later at night (like 4am) other times not until the next morning. He doesn't stumble or slur his words or anything but he just gets in this zone and doesn't seem to realize what is going on. \n He recently had a bunch of his friends from home stay with us for the 4th of July weekend. A couple of my friends and I met up with them at a bar. But my roommate drunkenly wandered off and nobody had any idea where he was. I ended up giving my apartment key to his friends because I didn't want to leave a bunch of tipsy girls stranded in downtown DC at 1am. But I had to end my night with my friends early because I was worried his friends would fall asleep and I would be locked out of my own apartment/ building because they wouldn't get my call to let me in. \n Also, the couple of times I've gone out with him just the two of us, he has gotten drunk and wandered. Once I just followed him around, the other time he told me to pick a spot to dance and chill and after getting halfway across the room I turned around to see him grinding up on a random 45 year old guy (my roommate and I are both gay). As bad as it sounds, I just left. Because we had only been there 15 minutes and was already off in lala land. \n I sort of don't know how to handle this. Firstly, I don't want to be responsible for making sure his friends can get into my building (I doubt this would happen again but still). Secondly, he is super nice and chill sober and I do want to be his friend but I'm not about being randomly left at a bar either. (I don't know how to express this without sounding whiny/needy). Also, flat out what he is doing will get him in serious trouble. But given that I've only known him a few weeks, I feel like it isn't my place to tell him that. \n Any advice on how to approach this?	Roommate is normally nice/responsible. But when he gets drunk he randomly wanders off and wakes up random places which has caused inconveniences for me and others. I dont know him too well so I don't know how to go about telling him that there is an issue.	467	47	needadvice
"I'm not actually graduating until next spring, but I thought that this would be a good time to ask, so I have plenty of time to get things in order or to possibly pursue some of the things that are advised. \n Here's the story: I'm 35 years old, a Marine Corps veteran and a married father of 3.

I'm starting an internship next week in a city that's a couple of hours away from my home, so I'm getting corporate housing for the duration of it. The city doesn't have much of a night scene or much to do in general, so I was worried what I would do on the weekends (besides whatever I do with other interns/employees). I'm the only intern staying there, that I know of, the rest are most likely people who work at banks, since that's what most of this town is made of. My friend told me though that most corporate housing places have lounges where a decent amount of the people staying there go in their free time to relax and chat with other people staying there. I know my place has that too, which is where the gym and laundry rooms are. So, my friend said since most people are away from home and many are single, a lot of hooking up happens with the people you meet in those rooms. Obviously, every place is different, I was wondering though what the general consensus was for what the general mood of a corporate housing lounge is?	What's the social scene (if you can call it that) like at a corporate housing? Do most people keep to themselves? Or do a lot of people go to the lounge and even look to have some fun/hookup with other people living there?	196	43	needadvice
So my friend and I have been given a box of Yu-Gi-Oh and Magic: The Gathering trading cards, and we thought we could sell them. We then found a website (cannot recall the name of forsaid site) that was nothing but these cards for sell. We noticed the sellers were regular people like us, not major companies, and were selling cards we have for more than expected. With the finding, we decided we should sell them and even buy more with the money of the sold cards and make profit. With some quick research we noticed a few people have done this, and after a bit of time, they have made a lucrative profit. \n Buy bulk/card packs Sell individual cards Make small profit Repeat \n We have discussed payment plans, we automatically knew we needed some sort of account online to complete any transactions. My friend, we will call him Paul, knows about PayPal alittle bit where I know zero about it. Indulging in some more research, Paul found a forum with a guy asking a similar question. Reading the forum, a man commented and said there was a way to have a PayPal account without having an actual bank account. This will involve the Walmart Prepaid Visa cards. \n I should probably make it known that we are both 17 and underage in the eyes of banks so we cannot open a checking account with a debit card. That was our original plan and just hook it up through PayPal... too easy. \n We soon ran into a problem with the Prepaid visa cards for it says you must enter you Social Security number. Being the age we are, Paul doesn't know his, and I feel uncomfortable releasing that information. Same with Paul. So we dropped that idea for now. \n Last option, we call Paul's sister who knows alittle more than him. No answer... great right? \n I come to Reddit in help to ask simply if there is a way to make transactions on the internet without having a preexisting bank account. We want to sell the cards we already own, buy more either online or at stores, and resell expensive ones.	just read it.	360	3	needadvice
I'm currently enrolled in Organic Chemistry II at my college.  It's expensive, fast-paced, and time-consuming, but normally I excel in difficult summer classes. \n The problem is, the professor is awful.  When he speaks, he mumbles in an odd dialect which leads most people to not show up and just read the lecture slides.  Still manageable. \n However, the recitation is bad too.  The instructor is  a foreigner who comes to class unprepared and just wings everything. \n Also, if I continue with Orgo II this summer, I'll only have five credits to take next semester.  This doesn't meet the half-time student requirements for financial aid. \n One plan is to drop Orgo II and take it in the Fall.  Still, I'm afraid that if I take it along with my other hard classes I'll overwhelm myself. \n So, do I relax, save money, and drop the class, or power through it?  If I power through, I'm confident I could pull out a B at least. \n I've already decided that if I do drop the class, I'm going to continue to attend lecture and do homework in order to prepare for next semester.	Drop my poorly taught organic class, continue to attend and do homework, and have a head start for next semester or power through it this summer?  I only have five credits for next semester, less than half-time.  Taking Organic II next semester will put me at half-time credits, allowing me financial aid and an opportunity to have a jump on the material.	188	62	needadvice
"Okay, this might require some psychological understanding and may be a little confusing, but here goes. \n I'm afraid of trusting my own convictions and making my own conclusions about the world.  I grew up in a conservative, reformed Christian background and am afraid that--given the freedom to choose--I might choose atheism and be doomed if Christianity is true.  I don't really like Christianity right now, but feel I can't pull away because of the ""Checkmate,"" this slim possibility that I'll choose wrongly and be damned for it.  Therefore, I'm stagnant, sitting here, too afraid to give myself choice because trusting myself is trusting a finite and fallible human who could make a grave mistake. \n Reddit, I need help being convinced that I should make my own decisions in life, that I am running no risk by encountering the world in my own way and interpreting it as an individual.

"This is going to be long. \n Several years ago my roommate (drunk) got with the girl everyone knew I was after.  She was VERY drunk and the social group hasn't been the same since; I get the feeling she wouldn't have done it if sober.  He was notorious for this, cheating with another friend's long term gf as well. \n Two months later, new girl that I was after I finally got the courage to ask out.  (I was seriously shy back then).  I'd been beaten to it by 20 hours.  This girl was perfect for me, we opened to each other about everything, but 20 hours. They're now married with a kid.  Good for her. \n I was close to breaking then.  Life was against me.  Then a week later, a married friend hit on me when I was driving her home from town (I was always the sober driver).  Like seriously hit on me.  Nothing like this had ever happened to me before.  Looking back, I don't know how, but I refused. \n A week later, another friend's gf made some suggestable moves, and I backed away. \n A week later, the first friend begged me to come over with her while her husband was away. Again, I refused, which is freaking hard to do. \n I fell for another girl, asked her out, but was turned down - she didn't want a relationship.  A month later she was in one. \n I was nearing stress.  Then, a friend took the next girl who he knew I was after.  Same girl had just told me she wasn't after a relationship with anyone right now, but he didn't know that, so I was fairly wrecked that he could do that to me. Don't care about her, she was quite evil knowingly doing this.  Anyway...it was the last straw.  I holed up.  I couldn't be around these friends.  For 8 months I was like this, and then I went travelling, I had to get away. \n For four years I lived on the other side of the world.  I travelled all over - months and months of travelling.  I had a girlfriend briefly (6 months) which was huge for me, to be able to trust someone, but it ended. \n Now I'm living in another country, having moved here this year. It's the fifth country I've lived in for more than six months.  I'm past 30.  And I'm stuck.  I can't find myself making commitments to anyone.  It's really, really hard to make friends.  I'm religious (yeah I know, not a reddit thing, but it's part of the story) but struggle to even enthuse about that side of my character.  I contract and find it hard to make friends with colleagues. \n Friends used to tell me I was ""a really nice guy"".  Perhaps too nice.  I know, I know, nice guys finish last and all that, but do you change? \n So anyway, here I am, a horrible hour of the night, far from home, and stressing about my future.  Do I try and move home? I have visited, and it's not the same any more.  Do I try and make a new home?  How do I make friends - each city I've been to before, I've at least known some others to start with, and spread out from there. \n How do I decide what to do next? Ever since that snapping point, for years, I've not been able to concentrate for long periods (a huge problem for my job, which I now enjoy far less as a result).  The only thing I'm good at these days (it feels like) is travelling, but try telling people that - to most people travelling is a holiday.  But I do it to some amazing places, in really difficult situations, dealing with dodgy police, sickness, insane border crossings and rough transport."

"My family adopted a ragdoll male around 9 years ago. He has always been the most laid back cat ever, even my dog lover friends think he's half a dog since he doesn't seem to act much like a cat. He follows ants on their trails, tries to make friends with birds and will let little kids pick him up by the neck and just takes it with the attitude of ""i'll just wait til this is over and you're bored of me"". Prior to this weekend he has never been vicious, others cats and people can tell immediately he's not an alpha cat. Other cats taunt him for this, whenever he gets territorial e.g. if another cat comes into the yard, no cat has ever been intimidated by him (unlike our other cat / my cat). We always come to his rescue when he gets like this and yell at said cat to get out of our yard. This happens probably once a week. \n This weekend was similar to any other, I heard him getting territorial and went to his aid. Yelled at said cat to get out our yard which it did, he was in zero danger being inside. Instead of happily going back to playing/sleeping/cat things, he turned to me and jumped at me and full on attacked me with claws. I now have about twenty open wounds, a number of scratches, bruising, had to get a tetanus shot, am on 4x antibiotics and the wounds will take 6 months to heal. I had to throw him off twice since once was not enough to stop him. This all happened in what felt like about 5 seconds. My first thought was he was trying to climb up me as he was scared. I then realised the reason he looked a bit different when he looked me up and down was because his eyes turned from bright blue to jet black and he was in attack mode. \n This is not at all in his nature, so we are all very surprised and I am now terrified of this cat coming at me again e.g. if he will now associate seeing other cats with attacking humans/me. The unpredictable nature and it not being his personality whatsoever freaks me out the most. We've had cats who have a bit of a vicious nature in them, he is the least of these. I dread coming home and spend most of my time at home ensuring he is nowhere near me.\nI understand I was in his territory when he was being territorial - but as this is not an unusual situation, I'm not sure what the best course of action is. \n I have spoken to our vet who has made some suggestions: \n \n Keep him more indoors  \n Mark his / other cats territory by spraying their urine around the yard \n \n I am more wondering if anyone else has dealt with this and had a solution that worked well. My mother has suggested everything from giving him away, putting him down or sending him to her (she lives now in Canada, myself and my sister are in Australia) but my sister doesn't want to do any of this. Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to make sense of this type of situation so I can reduce my anxiety? It being a ""one off"" hasn't convinced me. Of course doesn't have to be specific to cat specific stories/solutions."	Cat attacked me quite badly, how do I reduce my anxiety and how do we deal with him? \n EDIT: Thanks everyone for your comments - sorry it took a few days to reply, was studying for a Biochemistry test so was a bit MIA!	576	44	needadvice
I was told this week that my mother has terminal cancer. She has six months to a year to live. She is still young and I can't imagine life without her.  She is going to need to care at home but my (also loving) father is a functioning alcoholic. I have siblings that can help but they don't all live nearby. \n I divorced my husband last year. I have an 11 year old son, who asked me angrily last night why I didn't try harder with his father. My ex was emotionally manipulative. Only my counsellor knows the real reasons why we are divorced. \n I've moved to a nearby town since the divorce. We don't know anybody here yet. My ex stayed in our old home which is in the countryside and has his mother living with him. She minds my son often but was one of the causes of our divorce, as she undermined me constantly as a parent. \n I am worried that my ex is going to try for greater custody of my son. He has already hinted at this. My son likes playing with his cousin in our old house and told me he doesn't like it in my new house because he knows nobody here (yet). He's getting to the socially awkward stage but is usually a good mixer. We have had a strong bond up to this point. \n How will I manage keeping the bond with my son while spending precious time with my mum? I can't eat or sleep with worry.

As the title states, I have misplaced my wallet with my drivers license, debit cards, and other personally identifiable information. \n My evening started when I went out to a restaurant with friends for a birthday dinner. I paid for my meal and I'm 95% sure I put my wallet back in my pocket afterwards. I was sitting in a bench seat that required a lot of scooting and sliding to get out, so its possible it may have fallen out. But the thing is, I think I remember having it when I got into my friends car. I asked my friend to take a look in her car, but she isn't able to at the moment. \n I feel like I might be jumping the gun a little bit, since I dont know for sure whether or not its in my friends car, but I've looked all over my house for it and I even called the restaurant, but they haven't seen it. I'm kind of freaking out because I had some very personal information in there. \n Assuming its not in my friends car, what do I do next? Obviously I want to cancel my debit card, but what do I do about my license? How can I protect myself against credit/identity fraud? \n I live in in Michigan if that is relevant.

Hey all! \n As of two weeks ago, I've officially completed my B.Sc in pharmacology (yay!) and I'm having some difficulty deciding what to do next. I've decided that in the long-run, I'd really like to be involved in nutrition (hopefully private practice) and I've already been accepted to another undergrad program at both Ryerson and UBC, which after four years, I'll become a registered dietitian (RD). I've looked into (Canadian) masters programs in nutrition/dietetics, but they all require an undergrad in food sciences (does anyone have experience that claims otherwise? Perhaps taking a few courses to be eligible?). Further question would be should I choose UBC or Ryerson? \n That's all fine and dandy, but my dilemma is this: I've also been offered a job in fundraising (the field in which I've been working the past 3 years for my school), which will allow me to pay off my first degree within a couple of years, and still have some leftover to help pay the one coming up. Obviously, this would not be directly relevant to my field of study, but it's a managerial position that would provide me with some great experience/contacts. It'd also provide me a nice little break from school (for better or for worse?) \n What's your advice on going straight back to school vs. working in between? I would just like to hear some pros/cons for either side to help me decide what would be most beneficial in the long-run, along with your own experiences in the matter. Thanks so much for your help!	finished one undergrad. accepted to another in my planned field. but also offered decent-pay job. should I move ahead in my field, or take a break to work and then continue?	257	31	needadvice
I [18M] just had prom this past weekend and it was amazing. I got asked to prom by a girl [17F] I've known for about a year but I never really talked to that much until that night. And (I think) we really hit it off. Like she's very pretty, shares the same interests as me (She plays LoL), really smart, and I feel good when I'm with her and all that cheesy bullshit. But I'm hesitant in trying to take things further as I'll be leaving for college at the end of the summer and she'll still be in high school. On top of this, I'm not really experienced in relationships and girls and stuff. My last and only other relationship was freshman year where I was really good friends with a girl, and I was pressured by my friends to ask her out. I really forced it and it ended badly after half a year. I really like this girl but I don't want a repeat of my first relationship and to lose a good friend if it goes sour. Both relationships are really similar as they involve girls actually talking to me and girls where our older siblings were involved in the past. I don't know if that matters but it's kinda bugging me. I'm don't know if this is the right sub for this, but yeah. Thanks in advance!	She's really awesome and I don't wanna miss this opportunity, but I don't wanna lose an awesome friend.	233	18	needadvice
I work as a receptionist in a fairly disfunctional office. I've been there almost a year and a half and 13 or so people have quit. I do not have a manager or supervison, only a department director who isn't too attentive. Its been fantastic not having a manager and I've managed to slip into the role of basically an office supervisor, just without the pay or respect. \n However, I've never worked with all females in a small office before and these ladies are killing me! I keep trying to be proactive at work, covering people's positions that have quit, learning other realms of the department to try and keep the ship afloat, etc. But these ladies are so negative, petty and rude. Instead of approaching people who upset them, they've started expecting me to relay their messages or know why other employees did whatever action. Usually the first thing I walk into daily is a massive bitch fest over the smallest thing, they can't let shit go ever. I've essentially become their punching bag, I get snapped at or chewed out for issues out of my control and then half assed apologizes later. It's become like some fucked up manipulative relationshit. \n One is contintually on my ass about my outlook on the postion but then goes on to bitch about how other people do their jobs. The other goes through yelling bouts throughout the day. And another cries at a drop of a hat. And another, my director told me to be nice and let things slide because her age, sadly she's part of the fiscal department and forgets to pay people. But gotta be nice because she's 61. \n This is my first 'professional' job and I am trying so hard to maintain that with the public, but these women are making me miserable and my work and home life are suffering greatly. Its also causing our clients to suffer greatly, none of this drama and bullshit happen behind closed doors so our clients are very aware of it. Like today, we had a client in one room while the two nurses were in the hallway right outside yelling and cursing. \n I have spoke to my director, human resources and my union rep and they really don't have any thing to say. \n If anyone has suggestions please fire away. Thanks for reading!	My co-workers are making me miserable, I want to change it.	393	11	needadvice
"Reddit, I need help. The job I have now is the first one I have gotten since college. I work at a horse barn, I've been working for two years.  Don't get me wrong, I've learned a lot at this job, had lots of fun, and it's money income. \n Last year in August, my boss got divorced. My only other coworker jumped ship at the time because he figured that would be the end of the business. \nSince then, I've been working here, helping my boss get roughly 25 horses ridden daily by myself. \n My work days are Monday through Friday 7am- whenever we get done which is also roughly between 5-7pm.  And Saturday 7am-12pm. \nLately, due to the heat, my boss has asked that we start work at 4 am and get as many done before noon. I've kept track of my clock ins as well as his. He is consistently late to the barn by at least an hour and a half, some days even more.  And that's what has been the last straw.  I'm a normal human being, and I'm honestly getting fed up with him being SUPER late to the barn.  Here, it's ""we get done when boss is done.""  So, if he's late, he wants to ride the horses on his list, which means a longer day for me, and he's still riding and it's super hot outside and miserable for the horses. \n I used to love this job. \nI don't love it anymore, I do it because it pays bills. It's hard work for one person to do, I've expressed my concerns to our manager (his dad) and he more or less brushes it off.  (most times, he uses the 'oh the ex must be on the phone with him bitching about something') \n I'm tired reddit. I'm tired of being worked to complete exhaustion, getting stood up on those 4 am mornings, working by myself, back is always aching now, etc.  I could go on. \n Let it be known that I've been the only employee they've had that's worked this long.  Two years.  To me, that's shocking in itself.  Speaking with the farrier (Horse pedicure man, for those that aren't horsey aligned),  I've found that they've lost a lot of help because of the issues I have to deal with already. \n I'm a very patient, very tolerant, 24 yr old woman that is now, very fed up, and starting to get more and more bitter about this job that it's starting to affect my outside relationships with family, friends, and the boyfriend. \n So, there really isn't any hard feelings. I love everyone to death, and all our customers.  Just, I'm fed up with their (boss's) lack of responsibility, timeliness, motivation, give a fuck(?). \n I plan to end it at the end of this year, after the last horse show of the year in November, so I have some time. \n How do I go about breaking the news? And how to I prepare myself for a counter to said news?"	Fed up with boss's lazy, unmotivated butt at the horse barn.  There are no hard feelings, I want to quit.

"Hi all, \n I'm a 23 year old college graduate and in July of 2014 I began an internship in a very large global company which was due to last for 1 year. \n While I still live with my parents and the salary is competitive for intern standards, it is by no means sufficient to move out or to fully support myself. \n A month ago I had a conversation with Manager A (Who I do not currently report to) who suggested that I stay for an extra 6 months after my contract is due to terminate to cover where one of the team is on maternity leave and that he would just need to iron out a few details with HR if I agreed to it. \n I asked if my current contract would be extended, or if I would get a new one.. Basically ""will I be getting paid more?"". While Manager A did not commit to anything, he said ""We would like to see you paid a bit more"". Fair enough. \n Fast forward to today and I haven't heard any developments. I asked Manager A if he had heard anything from HR, to which he replies ""Oh yeah.. Eh.. Yeah that's ok, We're going to be keeping you for 6 more months"". I asked about the contract terms and he said that it's an extension of my internship and I won't be getting paid any more than what I'm currently earning. \n I would like to emigrate after this 6 month extension and I have already projected that I will not have saved enough cash (whilst maintaining a car, a love life and a small bit of rent for my parents) to follow through with these plans. \n Am I within my rights to ask to be paid more? I don't have any other jobs currently lined up and I'm afraid it'll become a ""take it or leave it"" scenario. If it gets to this point and I settle for the salary I'm currently on, I'm worried it could create bad feeling between my manager and I."	I'm an intern for the past 11 months.

I have been having these feelings of not being approved of and being looked down on for a while now. \n I feel that I must make reasons for everything that I do because someone will question me about it and that I shouldn't be doing that because I am not good enough. These feelings are very overwhelming. I often plain hide things that I do and make up excuses as to what I am doing so I don't have to make excuses to justify myself to others. As I am poor I must make up justifications more than that are needed to buy things that I need. \n Example:\n I went to the store for spray paint, for a project. As I do woodworking as a hobby and used to do it as a job I felt compelled to tell the guy helping me about how experienced I am, when in reality all I needed was help finding a color. Like I don't want to be seen as a hack but someone with experience. \n This feeling of worthlessness consumes daily thought. In all reality my life is not great. I have made many poor decisions and don't take care of myself. I also am very poor and can't support myself financially. These feelings make me not want to do things as the thought of other people judging me is very large. I feel a lot of judgement, in my own head,  of buying something remotely nice as I am not worthy of such things because my life is, on paper, not very good. \n While I feel that everyone is looking down on me, I don't think of people as lesser or greater, more along the lines that we are all equal and can work together. I want to be friends with everyone, no one is out of my league or lesser than me.	Must overly justify myself to make myself seem worthy. \n First thread on reddit, any help putting this in the right place would be much appreciated.	312	25	needadvice

So I'm a 18 year old guy and well I have this weird problem. When I was young I would always cover my own eyes when I saw a kissing scene or a naked women on TV. This behavior has followed me even now. \n When I'm walking with my friends they often check out women and commentate. I however feel this huge sense of shame whenever I look at a woman that I don't know after a second and even the slightest glimpse puts me to unbearable shame. Making eye contact is fine and I often look at people in the eyes when talking to them regardless of the gender, but looking at anything but the face makes me feel horrible. \n I even get ridiculed a bit by my friends (more of jokingly) that I can't watch porn. To them it all feel natural but to me it feels disgusting but I guess that is a good thing, can't get addicted,right?	Can't look at women for more than a second without feeling horrible guilt and summer is making it even worse.	161	20	needadvice
I don't know where to put this and it's a long story so please bare with me. I'm in the military and my wife and I just had to love cross country to San Diego, CA. We had to stay in a shitty area of town the first weekend we are here due to hotel availability. Her car was broken into last night/this morning. They stole 2 large suitcases a large beach bag and our air mattress (really wtf), anyway police were called because all of her Jewlery was in one of the suitcases (over $5k). The police are going to assign this to a detective which is great but I have little hope. Of everything missing I really only care about her stuffed dog that was in the suitcase. My wife has had it since she was a baby and is her only thing she has had since she was that young. She had a really terrible childhood and her stuffed dog has been there for her and means the world to her. She cried for days when we thought it was lost in our last move and now it is actually gone. I haven't pointed it out to her that it was in her suitcase yet because of how upset she is already. I want to know what else I can do to try and hunt down her stuff. I will do ANYTHING to get just that back for her. Any suggestions would help out so much. I sincerely thank any suggestions.

I\u2019ll have my econ undergrad degree in December. I am looking to maximize my rate of investment. I loathe accounting, finance has been uninteresting up to this point. I really enjoy utilizing the skill set learned to apply to not so obvious economic situations. Books like Freakonomics, and Naked Economics Undressing the dismal science. \n So with that, I still have to live in the real world, and I have student loans to pay back. I am 38, this is my second bach degree, I have been in IT and Health Care (former Sonographer). I am willing to go to any length to get the maximum return here. Relocating is obvious. I\u2019ve been looking at Hawaii, because I think it would be awesome to live there for at least 3 years. Also been seeing Federal jobs I could qualify for in Washington D.C. \n Looking for suggestions, tips? I know I need to start drilling down, and networking. I\u2019m in the middle of America right now. Thoughts/Experience would be very helpful. I have a concentration/emphasis in econometrics. And personally I love anything to do with macroeconomics. Just seem to gravitate to that subject matter. Also, is there a career that involves international travel? \n Thanks \n If any specific information is needed please just let me know.

188 is a weight I haven't seen in maybe a year, and I'm only 19. I started gaining a lot of weight in college just because there was cheap food every where. I grew up in a town with only a Burger King, the one fast food place I don't like. And now in a college town we have almost two of every chain restaurant. \n It's like I lost all my control but then gained all the control in maybe a month's time. I can say no to any food (just not alcohol, but I didn't learn my lesson about drinking on an empty stomach, I'll do it again for sure) and I've given myself the rule of never spending a dime on food. Gives me more money to spend on zero calorie energy drinks because I'm tired all the time. \n I don't have any desire to eat at all. I feel like every single calorie will set me back by pounds. It feels better to not have anything in my stomach. The only time I manage to eat without crying or trying to puke is when I'm really high on weed. The worst part is I'm mostly doing this for someone because I love him but I'm not hot enough right now for him. This isn't my speculation, it's from his own mouth. \n And sometimes I have to eat because people will insist I try some of their food or something and I will, I'll chew it and enjoy it and then go to the toilet and spit it out. And I don't want any of this to stop. I'm losing weight so fast, if I just do this a little longer then I'll be 100lbs before I know it and I'll have a higher chance of being with the person I love and I'll be happy because I can love myself then too.	getting a little upset, but not worried, about not eating to lose weight, but I can't stop.	315	17	needadvice
Backstory: Missed a crapload of work during second quarter (week of flu and 2 weeks after parents surgery of missing class, impossible to make up) and got a mediocre grade for the quarter (33%). Also got 75% on first and third quarter from missing key essays (also from parents surgery, removing two discs in the neck and they had complications). I'm a senior, so I'm afraid that with a shortened fourth quarter, I will not have enough grades in the actual book to offset the really low E in second and will not pass the class and graduate. Hes a chill guy, so I expect he will let me make some stuff up for extra credit, but I want to put it in the right way.	Failed second quarter, got mediocre C in other two, few grades in fourth.

I can't think of a better word than scared. Everything is perfect in my life, i er a great kid, great wife, shelter, food, work and am on university. My wife works and studies as well, we both get our bachelor this may. So you would think im fine right? \n I can't stay calm, i live in constant fear of what can happen to me or my family. This varies from having to fight someone in the street(has happened in this neigborhood) failure in school, failure to find a job after school. I don't even enjoy some of the recreative things i did because now when i do it all i get is depressed and even more paranoid(smoke). \n I face a lot of pressure from my bosses. They are the kind of people that like to get in your head and fuck with you,i'm desperate to get out of that place but i need to hang on untill i get my shit together in school. That gets to my head, it actually makes me start to believe im a piece of shit that can't do shit right. I'm a man tho, im expected to handle this fine but to be honest... im not and its really fucked up for me, i don't tell anyone this. \n On top of that, my brain is starting to lose information. I forget things in seconds, i have to take notes of everything and thats not fine because my job is handling people's money. Its not unnatural for me to get paid something and forget it 5 seconds later. \n So i feel like im failing at my work, im failing at my marriage, failing to my kid and hanging on at school... I feel like less of a person and scared of confrontation, like i got a fucking war disorder. Scared for my family or my well being constantly. I could go on forever. Truth is i don't know what has overcame me, why am i so lost and scared when everything seems to be alright?	Married man scared shitless of life with no reason	341	9	needadvice
"Okay, so here's the deal. I'm a graphic designer and currently without a job. One of my contacts told me about this former teacher of us who was looking for a graphic designer to help out some students. Everything seemed okay at this point. I contact this guy and we meet. Everything goes smoothly and we make a plan on how I will tutor these students. \n Stuff went really fast the afternoon I got introduced with my students. It was the end of the day and the building got closed around 2 hours after I got there. There was no contract signed, which might have been my first red light.\nI hear nothing from this teacher and I send him a mail with the question about the money. He tells me I can declare my traveling bill with them and get the money from some lady who takes care of the financial stuff. It's apparently voluntary work. But hey, I got nothing better to do and it looks nice on my cv. So I go with it.\nProlem is, I went there last thursday, did my thing and got to find out this former teacher nor the lady were there. I got nothing for my expenses and I don't really know what to do. I just went back home after having some people tell me there was nothing they could do and then return to their jobs. \n I want my money, but I'm afraid to go there for the next appointment only to find out this former teacher and this lady aren't there again. I can't legally bind them to pay me since I got no black-on-white contract with signatures and I don't trust them enough to head over there after they've abused my faith in them. It's just 12 euros for now, but I can't afford to lose any money.\nWhat is the best option? I do not know what to do and don't want to be ""that bitch"" who makes a lot of drama out of 12 euros. I know it's stupid I haven't got a contract, but I got some mails, even though I don't have any mails in which is stated I have indeed not been paid.

"I only worked with this man for about 5 months, and he quit over a year ago. He recently sent me a long email asking me to be a reference for a new job, and instructing me in all the positive things I should say about him. Those things would be, shall we say, inaccurate. His request was really presumptuous, but he did say if I didn't feel comfortable with it I could tell him and he wouldn't be mad at me. My first instinct is to just ignore the email but apparently he already listed me as a reference so, should I reply to him? What should I say to the new employer if they call? Can I just tell him ""I'm not going to say these things, please don't contact me again""?

"I'm going to start off by saying I am not one of those people who expects/wants to be best friends with my roommate. \n About a month and a half ago my roommate (a complete stranger) and I got a place in DC. I'm a DC native, went to high school and college here etc. He is brand new to the city other than a stint interning here one semester. As such, I sort of expected that if we got along we would be friends since the easiest way for him to integrate socially is through me and the friends I have here. \n We get along pretty well other than a few minor usual roommate issues (most of which I honestly just let go and don't make a fuss over). However, he doesn't seem to want to hang out with me. This would be fine if we were just different people; but we have similar personalities, quite a few common interests, and are both pretty social people. So I don't quite understand why he doesn't want to even attempt to hang out. \n He has a few friends interning here for the summer so he hangs out with them a lot. And that's cool, I hang out with my friends a lot too. The difference is, that probably 50% of the time I invite him to come along. He always says he will think about it and then never comes - sometimes he just stays home so it's not like he has conflicting plans. \n On the other hand he has only invited me out twice. Both times he had like 8 people staying with us (his friends from home) in the living room (which I was fine with), however these were very obviously ""You are letting my friends stay here so I'm obligated to invite you to tag along"" invites. Weirdly the friends really like me and one of them even told him that he is lucky to have ""such an awesome roommate."" \n I could totally understand if we hung out a bit and we just didn't click. But we haven't even gotten to that point. Plus, all his friends are going to be gone in a couple weeks so you think, if nothing else he'd want to get to know people (he is one of those social butterflies who has lots of friends at home). \n This leads me to think that I'm doing something off putting. I'm not sure what, and it's not like I can really ask. I feel like it has to be this - because before moving in and meeting each other we talked a lot about all of the social stuff we were going to do. \n It's not really a big deal; but I've never lived with someone who wasn't my friend before and I just find it weird that we barely interact. \n I will admit, I work full time and take two grad school classes so some nights I do pretty much forego social stuff and go straight to me room. But I feel like I'm social enough other days that this really shouldn't matter. \n Any advice on what to do or maybe how to be a bit more welcoming? Maybe he is still adjusting to a new city/job? \n I know I can't force anything; but I really would like to know whats going on."

Myself and two others have a monthly event that I want to make t-shirts for. \n It's $215 for 24 t-shirts, and we agreed to sell them for $20, which would make us $90 each in profit after we've made our money back. \n This meant putting down ~$70 per person initially. But now, the other two backed out of putting down the money because they each had something come up. So I'm going to pay the entire $215. \n Is it fair to keep a majority of the profit, because I put down the entire payment and took on the risk factor for this merchandise endeavor? For what it's worth, I also designed the t-shirts and picked the color theme, etc. Part of me feels like they will be making their $90 profit without actually doing anything/risking anything.

Hello reddit. My husky, Cleo, is a female husky and about 2 years old. About three days ago, we saw a radical change in her and later found out she ate the root part of a sago palm. We rushed her to a vet who referred us to a hospital where she went under 24 hour care. Well, luckily she threw up all of what she ate and her liver are back to normal levels as what the doctor had told us. \n She is back home now and we are giving her medications that the hospital gave us. My question is...she seems so lethargic and almost depressed looking. Usually when she sees someone come through the door, she jumps, licks your face and starts running around the house like an energizer bunny. Lately, she's been the complete opposite and it is starting to worry me. \n I've scheduled a follow up visit to her regular vet to check on her liver. Could this experience have traumatized her? Or maybe this might be side effects to the meds? Any advice? I would love to hear. Thanks.	my dog isn't as happy as she was before eating sago palm root.

This is a throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm currently in a ethical dilemma and I want to report a coworker. Bit of background I work at a reasonably priced stationary store that sells other homewares, bits and bobs etc, which appeals to multiple customers and my co worker and I were working shift one day recently when I found out that she has her own personal side business with a few handmade products that are similar in some ways with the store I work at. \n Anyway to the point, we are both supposed to be focused on maximising our sales as a part of our positions and are expected to achieve good work outcomes but my co-worker recently did the opposite and redirected a customer to her business when we had the product in store. What was surprising she even told me her reasoning was that they find a lot of the products poor quality and the prices to be over inflated thus she thinks it was her duty of care to inform customers. I personally agree that some products are lower in quality but I can't as a sales assistant deter a customer from purchasing for these reasons alone for the simple fact that the customer made a choice to do business there. However, she ended up saying this to a customer as a way of redirecting them to her own business and we lost a potentially large sale. However, I wasn't present when this did occurred, as she told me of an example of when she did it and how (because I inquired how she was able to do this considering she has to be loyal to our store as an employee in my opinion) and I'm not sure if she has done this more often. \n So my question is, should I report her even though her business does not have as many products (two currently) as the current store I work at and for taking a benefit of the doubt approach that this is a one off thing? \n Another issue that worries me about this as I just started recently as did she and I'm worried if she does get in trouble it will come back to me and make working difficult as a few co-workers have taken a liking to her and even allowed for her to do it so long as she doesn't refer to her business directly as hers but a 'friends'.	co worker redirected customer to her business and I want to report her.	408	13	needadvice

I by no means consider myself stupid, disregarding humility, I am really smart when it comes to looking at a problem and though a series of steps working it out.  In such a way, I am excellent in maths, chemistry and similar subjects that work with numbers and laws.  Secondly, I like to consider myself creative and analytical.  I am writing a book that (i believe at least) is not half bad, plus when it comes to analysing a situation and coming to a conclusion I am not bad at that either.\nMy bane however, is remembering.  This has always been a problem for me, especially when it comes to concepts that are extremely similiar.  For example, as a vet technologist, I have to remember a significant proportion of muscles in the human body, but I suck at this completely.  The second problem is, the longer I struggle learning one concept, the further behind I am getting.  While I am still trying to learn the difference between the deltoidius and trapezium, I am already supposed to know what goes on at a cellular level.\nSo I am slowly yet sure sinking into a pit where I cannot get out of.  And this is still the easy things, vet science is a lot more difficult and fast paced.\nThe problem I have, I CANNOT ever see myself working in an office looking at a computer screen all day long, or working in a lab doing calculations for drugs.  I can only ever see myself working with animals, or something similar (perfect job is a tv presenter (like david attenborough or steve backshall) but that is near impossible). \n So what should I do?  I could do with some good advice here, because I know my family won't understand.	Want to be a vet but I suck at remembering even the basic aspects like the muscles, and it is just getting worse and worse.  Obviously I don't want to quit, but....

So here's the story as it appears to me: This morning a Fedex driver dropped a package off at my doorstep. I knew that it was a bicycle that my brother-in-law ordered for my daughter. Today is her third birthday. I brought the package inside and left it. My plan was to put it together when my wife got home from work, but before my daughter's party. Shortly after four pm, the doorbell rang. It was the same fedex delivery driver. She demanded the package back. I asked why. She stated that there was a problem with the vendor and that she needed it back. I produced the box and showed her that it was addressed to my wife; it had our address and that it was the bike that my brother-in-law ordered for my daughters birthday. She apologized, but insisted on taking the package. I told her I was very upset, not with her, but that I would be following up on the situation. I said that I normally wouldn't care but it was my daughters present and today is her birthday. I felt the hate flow through me as I watched my sweet little girl's present being taken away. The driver told me to call the vendor and take it up with them. I called Amazon.com, the vendor, and explained my situation. They said that they didn't have the authority to have a delivery service reclaim a package and to follow up with fedex. I called fedex and they said it's a vendor issue and not their problem. This seems highly irregular. I'm so upset that I'm typing in short sentences. What do I do? Does this stuff really happen? I feel bullied and duped? Who comes and demands a three year olds gift back?

"Hi! \n Firstly, I'm guessing people often need advice about failing in school etc. and I'm no exception but I am really at a loss here. \n Secondly, I am okay with failing in general. Failing teaches us things and I often say that success and failure is on the same path, I'm not worried about failing in itself. \n So to my problem! This term (studing to become an English teacher in Sweden) I am writing a paper (about English grammar). In Sweden, this is called ""C-paper"" but I've come to understand that that term isn't used anywhere else so it's really the closest to what you would call mini dissertation. It should be about 20-25 pages long. \n I've had some problem with a depressed mood/burn out/anxiety and it took me forever to get started with this paper. However, since I have been recovering well for the past few months, once I actually started things worked out GREAT. I have now written about 13 pages. The issue is that when I did get started I had to change my material in the middle, making me lose a lot of time (had to schedule and do interviews which took weeks) and now that I have finally done that and written about 5 pages of my result my supervisor tells me I can't use this material (long story why). Quite a simple screw-up really, nothing huge and unfixable. With new material I could just rewrite the results part. BUT the problem is that I have about 2 weeks and I won't even have new material by then. I feel pretty screwed and sad (obviously) and I'm not sure how to progress. I am meeting my supervisor on Wednesday. Either she tells me everything's fine (1 % chance), or she tells me I need new material or make a new/another study. What do I do? I have one day before I meet her, otherwise two weeks. What would you do? Give up? Find new material? Start over?"	Writing a 20-25 pages paper.

So this is actually a pretty great problem to have, but I'm a 20 year old college student and I just finished my sophomore year. In 4 weeks I'll be going to Ireland to do an internship for 3 months, but in the meantime I've moved back to my boring ass hometown to chill until I leave for Ireland. \n I think I'm going crazy. All of my friends are in the city where I've lived for the past 2 years. I don't usually come home for more than 2 weeks at a time but now I'm here for what feels like a really long time. What can I do while I wait for my internship to start so I don't go crazy?	I have a month of no school and no work but there is seriously nothing to do here.	122	18	needadvice
I know this is going to sound crazy, but a lot of odd things have been happening around my house lately and I'm not sure if I'm going crazy or if there are reasonable explanations. \n I don't really know where to start.  The first item I noticed something missing was my laptop in January of this year.  My charger was where it should be, but I could not locate my laptop.  My husband and I had just moved in the month prior and assumed it just got misplaced in the chaos.  Six months later, it is still missing. \n Other things have either been misplaced, but more than that, things have started just moving.  They aren't in the last place I (or my husband) put them.  Today (the straw the broke the camel's back and send me here to ask for help) has the perfect example.  We have a rumba vacuum that's charging station is on the left of the TV stand.  I left for work this morning and cleaned out the trash bin and replaced it at the charging station.  When I got home today, the charging station was on the right, with the rumba charging.  My husband left yesterday on a business trip, and I haven't been home all day. \n I don't believe in ghosts or paranormal activity as a whole, but right now it's the only thing I can think of - and apparently this ghost is just having fun screwing with me.  This house was built in the 1920s and we do see things fall without reason and doors shut without cause, but I have always chalked that up to an old house that isn't flat or straight and gravity having fun.  I have no history on this house other than my next door neighbor's grandmother owned a few houses on this street, and the person we bought it from used to rent the house. \n In all seriousness though, there is no sign of forced entry, we lock the doors in the front or back (though the possibility of someone coming through a window is a possibility I guess).  I just don't understand if someone is coming into my home for the last six months, why haven't we been robbed?  Why do they only touch random things?  If it's not just a random person, then what do I do?  How do I even pretend to address this?  Is there something to address or am I just crazy?

So, can someone help me out here?\nI've decided that I will be baking my Mom sugar free choclate chip cheesecake cookies and getting her a card + flowers. \n HOWEVER, I'd like to admit that I've never done anything before for my Mom on Mother's Day.... except tell her I love her of course. Now I have money to spend and I'm willing to spend around 100 on a gift, it can come late I don't care! \n Now I just want to know where I can buy some quality gifts for my Mom who is Indian (INDIA). I don't know as much as I'd like to about my own culture, and I've never had other Indian friend's since I've always moved so so much in my life growing up. \n I'd really appreciate it if someone can link me to sites where I can buy her quality Indian gifts. \n Some idea's I've thought of: \n \n A Lakshmi statue for her prayer room \n an Indian tapestry/bed spread (not too fond of this one, seems really half-assed) \n ...... im out of ideas... \n \n I don't want to do clothes because I'm afraid I don't know her sizes and I'd love to buy her shoes, but she has a really picky taste on what shoes she will wear. She is a size 5.5 with E width feet, but I just don't want to buy her shoes that are uncomfortable for her since only she knows what works for her.	Please recommend me sites where I can purchase quality Indian (Not Native American Indian) related gifts. Budget is $150, doesn't matter if it comes later than Sunday!	243	27	needadvice
I'm finishing grad school in Boston in a few weeks. I want to live in either Boston or SF. I can find a good (engineering) job in either one. Either way, I have to sacrifice relationships: if I stay here by rarely seeing my extended family, and if I move by losing touch with my friends here. \n Reasons to move to SF: I could see my brothers [22M, 23M] a few times a week instead of a few times a year like I do now. We're close and I want to maintain my relationship with them as we all get older. Also, I am drawn to SF as the hub of entrepreneurship and disruptive change that makes new billionaires. Also, no ice-covered roads or humidity would be nice. Also I might be able to get back in touch with a couple of friends from long ago who live in the Bay Area. \n Reasons to stay in Boston: I'm comfortable with my routine here. I only have a handful of friends but I know them well and see them pretty regularly. I also enjoy Boston's culture of academic achievement and intellectualism. Also, I do mechanical engineering so I have slightly better job prospects out here due to SF's software focus. Also, I'm worried about my dating chances in SF: I'm single now and here in Boston there's a good balance of eligible women and men, and I'm worried in SF there are too many men and the few women there would ignore me unless I'm able to make a few million from a startup. Also, rent is moderately cheaper here than in SF. Also, I'm worried that even though I'm from the West Coast originally I won't be able to transition back to the culture of SF after becoming comfortable with East Coast formality and resume-polishing. \n I don't know how to make this choice. In the next few years I want to progress in my career and get engaged to a quality woman. I could do this either place. It feels like I'd save about a year by staying in Boston and not having to start over, but I'd regret staying after 3+ years and growing apart from my brothers and extended family. Both choices seem painful so I can't fully commit to either. I need to decide in the next week so I can move on to the next step and know what to tell my friends/family about my plans after graduation (2 weeks from now!).	Do I live near Boston (current friends and city) or San Francisco (family and new city)??	416	16	needadvice
I have been living with my two friends for about a year and one of them is a laid back regular guy but the other is very petty and holds grudges that dont even exist. This guy is competitive, something i can usually deal with but in this case he never admits when he is wrong or when he doesnt know how to do something. Everything is communal in our kitchen and we take turns cooking. Im not trying to sound cocky but i cook the best because i have done it for a long time. Everytime i cook he intentionally does not eat and when he does he just leaves half of it on the plate so everyone can see. I honestly thought i was being paranoid because i take pride in my cooking but today i realized how bad it was. It was my turn to cook last night and once again he did not eat. The other housemate goes on to tell him how good the food is because they were talking about how hungry they were and he still doesnt eat, fine maybe he forgot about his hunger and then today when the other guy cooks who is the worst cook out of all of us. He goes on to tell me about how good his cooking is and long he has been hungry. Throwing all the food i cooked in the trash. I forget to mention how this started..initially it was me and the the laid back guy in the house. Laid back guy didnt care about what he ate so we stuck to making the same thing until the ultra competitive guy came. He let us know that he will be the best cook we have ever met and i was genuinely excited. After a few weeks of him calling himself gordon ramsey and how we should bow down to him i decided to stop being lazy and put some effort. He had is female friend over and she commented that it was the best thing that she ever ate and laid back guy agreed. He became really pissed and said it was a fluke. I just laughed it off as a joke, but ever since then he has been acting strange. Everytime i cook he says something negative like theres too much garlic in here or i have a friend who makes this better. Also the other day i was leaving for the night and i made pancakes. I had made enough for everyone but he waited till i left to eat the last one. Laid back guy tells me he then tried to make his own but he messed it up. So laid back guy calls me puts him on the phone for me to direct him, he then proceeded to say he is fine and knows what he did wrong, tries again and fails so he tells LBG to never tell me about it. Im starting to think i should just buy my own food and forget about them?	housemate is so competitive that he starves himself when i cook because i am a better cook. Want to stop cooking for them	508	23	needadvice
"So here's the basic run down... My roommate, let's call her Sally, has had a history of stealing from me in the past. I lived with her in the dorms both my freshman and sophomore years of college, and this year, junior year, we live in an apartment together (I know, my first mistake was living with someone for three years when she has a history of stealing, but I can assure you, she's moving out this year.) \n The past years she's stolen makeup items from me (high-end, not just the cheap stuff) and I've always asked her if she had it, but she would say no. But then I would go snooping through her stuff and I would end up finding it in her makeup bag. I am not very confrontational, so I just took it back and never said anything to her, but she had to have known I took it back once she saw it wasn't with her stuff anymore.. \n This year my $30 Nars blush went missing. Now in the past when things had gone missing and she said she didn't take it, I let it slide because we lived with other people, and ""maybe"" she wasn't the one who took it. But now, it's just her and me living together. So, when my blush went missing, naturally I asked her if she took it. This is the conversation. \n Me: hey, do you have my Nars blush? I used it on Saturday and put it back where I ALWAYS put it and haven't touched it until today (Tuesday) when I went to go use it, it wasn't there\nHer: no I don't but I'll look through my stuff when I get home. \nMe: if you find it, let me know, it was $30 and I need it back. \n A few hours later\nHer: I don't have it\nMe: did you have any friends over that could have taken it? I'm 110% sure that I left it in my makeup bag.\nHer: Jane and Linda (also fake names) were here the other night, maybe they took it. \nMe: can you ask them? \n DAYS later\nHer: Jane said she might have it, she'll send me a picture of it later \n After a day or two I hadn't heard back from Sally so I texted her and asked if she had gotten the picture from Jane. She said ""no, but I'm going to their apartment later so I'll look for it."" \n Then she sent this a few hours later\n""So, I'm dumb. Jane and Linda weren't over last week, it was the week before. But I looked in their apartment and it wasn't there. Sorry."" \n So basically she just admitted to being the only person at our apartment from the time I last used it to the time it went missing...? I've snooped through her stuff but I can't seem to find it. Of course, she knows I'm looking for it, and because of our past she knows I'll go through her makeup bag, so she takes that with her every time she leaves the apartment. \n I'm just frustrated and don't know what to do. I want my blush back, and I want her to stop taking my stuff, and I don't know how to approach her and tell her that all the signs point to her having the blush. Especially since I hate confrontation. Help me!"	my roommate is stealing my stuff and non-confrontational me doesn't know how to talk to her about it.	568	18	needadvice
Hey reddit. I am 21 years old, active duty US Air Force with a wife and son. I cant seem to find any drive or direction in life.

"Hi, I'm under 30 and have a serious problem with concentration which badly affects my mood and personal life. I believe that it became this big when I was promoted at work and instead of performing precise tasks, currently I have to lead a group of 20+ people, assign tasks, give advice on the job etc. Literally: I have to talk more, remember more and am more stressed (I am the kind of guy who wants to do everything as well as possible). \n So the thing is that sometimes when somebody speaks to me I fail to concentrate on what they tell me, even though I try. I really do. My mind may become blank during conversations - as though I was closed in a soundproof, black box. If I cannot ""hear"" someone, I have problems recollecting it or cannot remember it at all (in some cases this may mean that I totally can't say what someone told me a moment ago). \n The problem is both frustrating and worrying - I am worried that this could evolve into a serious disease when I'm older. I have always had a similar problem only when trying to do more that one thing at a time (for example, reading and thinking about something totally different makes me forget about what I did read; I have to re-read the last page) but what I am observing nowadays is much worse. \n Are there any exercises/activities which could help? Could this be caused by stress or the amount of work?"	"my mind may become blank during conversations - as though I was closed in a soundproof, black box"""	254	18	needadvice

Obviously to those of us who know and understand the dangers of the internet, it's a simple matter of delete and move on. My mom is still naive and new to the Internet and malicious e-mail practices. \n She ended up clicking the link, signed up for some weight loss vitamins that supposedly were demonstrated on Oprah and all that usual bullshit.

Basically my 12 year old brother was suspended for changing the name of a whatsapp group message to ..... sucks dick (some kid in his class). Obviously he shouldnt have done it but he was told he was going to get expelled and was absolutely devastated until they finally decided to suspend him (about a week later).

"Hey /r/needadvice, \n In short, I need advice. Throwaway account obviously. My friend and I are high school students doing an internship away from home and rented a room in a house with an older woman close to our workplace. A flea infestation has taken place in the house, and the landlady has admitted to having the problem in the past. She has regular rental rooms with up to 10 people living there at a time including her and there are always people going in and out. She regularly leaves the doors open to ""air out the house"". The house is tile and old wood floored and easily from the 1950s. She has dogs that have vaccinations and what seems to be monthly flea treatments, but they are in and out of the house all the time. Since our first bites, she has locked them out of the house. I got my first bites most likely from fleas jumping off from them as they pawed my legs - I was wearing shorts and I am never outside unless I am going to work. She had our room cleaned today ""to ready it for fumigation"" but won't fumigate until after we leave this weekend. \n However, when the cleaning ladies she hired were cleaning, she came in and took pictures of the room. We had a lot of cardboard moving boxes and trash lying around because we didn't want to go out in the yard where many of the fleas and mosquitoes are to toss the trash. We were planning to toss it all when we left - so we wouldn't risk bringing more bugs in etc. There was some dust as well because we are both girls - no cleaning supplies were provided for us, such as a vacuum cleaner. \n The landlady confronted me today about the ""messy room"" and blamed us for the flea infestation. She has pictures of the boxes and dust that was gathering around and says that ""it was probably you who brought it in and the fleas lived in your mess"". \n In short, we are afraid that she will refuse to return our deposit because she thinks it is our fault. She has expressed anger at the situation and having to pay for the fumigation. She has admitted to having dozens of bites when she was watering her garden. I walk through her garden every day to get to work. She insists it is not her dogs. I have not gotten any bites since avoiding her dogs and the kitchen area, where I got my first bites. I've been eating and drinking and hiding out in my room, and know that I do not have fleas. I've only been wearing long pants and sleeves that cover my shoulders, and my bites are only on my knees to the feet area, with a few on my hands. \n What should we do to make sure we keep our deposit? How do I insist that I am innocent/as is my roommate? We've already contacted our parents about it. Help! Thank you!"

"Hello Reddit! I am in desperate need of your help. \n Growing up my house was always messy, and when I say messy I don't mean a dish left on the table, I mean there was no room to eat at the table. I am currently 21 and my house is still like this. \n One of the big reasons I feel like my house is like this is because my mother doesn't really do anything to clean the house. It's not like we rely on her to clean up, it's just that she leaves a mess herself. \n Another reason my house is like this is because my mother buys an excessive amount of stuff on a daily basis. And when she does buy something it is WAY more than we need. An example of this is when she ordered clear plastic cups online. We rarely ever use them but she ordered 6,000. I'm not even exaggerating, I have 6,000 cups in a box in my hallway. (I feel like she has a shopping addiction) \n Another reason my house is like this is because no one tries to clean the house, except for me. I have cleaned for house only for it to go back to the way it was days later. Also when I do clean, my mom goes through the garbage bags to see if I threw out anything she ""needs."" \n I should also mention that no one has come over my house for years, except family on the occasional holiday, and I have never had friends over because of this problem. \n This is an overall embarrassing and frustrating situation I have been dealing with throughout my entire life.

"I know, I know.. marijuana is supposedly not addicting. My mother is addicted to the high she gets from it. She smokes at least 5 times a day (and that's lowballing it). She doesn't work.

Ok so my wife and I have a pit bull. She's been an awesome dog her whole life. So now the problem: \n She has arthritis and we give her novox for it. We also give her tramadol because she tore her ccl a few months ago. We also give her a joint supplement and bladder strengthening supplement. \n When she tore her ccl we took her to the vet because she was limping around and falling down. We weren't sure what was going on. The vet said that surgery was a risky option and probably not worth it since she is so old. Understandable. So a few weeks go by and she's not 100% better but it was a big improvement. \n Unfortunately my grandfather passed and my wife and I had to go out of town. We always board our dog when we go out of town. When we pick our pup up from the vet, we notice that she's weak just like when she tore her ccl. We know that she strains herself a bit when she gets boarded because she always has a hoarse bark when we pick her up. A couple of weeks go by and her legs are doing better. \n Now comes the issue we have now. A few weeks ago we had to go out of town for two days to wrap up some estate issues from my grandfather. We board the her as usual. When we pick her up from the vet, same situation as last time. Weak in the back legs again, so we figure just watch her make sure she doesn't strain herself and make sure she gets rest. \n It's been three weeks and it doesn't seem to be getting better this time. She has trouble standing up after laying down. Her back legs cross and she trips over herself sometimes when walking. She loses coordination and bumps in to things and falls down. She seems just like she always has as far as her personality and she doesn't seem like she's in pain. She gets super excited to eat (her favorite parts of the day) and go outside. it's just frustrating and sad to see her body not moving like she wants it to. \n We have to board her again this weekend and we're worried that she might come out of this one even worse than before. Any help or suggestions on treating the injury or in general would be greatly appreciated.	dog is old, having trouble walking, gets worse after boarding, has to get boarded again this weekend	410	17	needadvice
I was pointed over here by the mods at /r/relationship_advice. I'd really appreciate some advice on my elderly neighbour. \n My boyfriend and I live in a house in London next door to an elderly woman. We've lived here for about a year now, and I chat with her pretty often so I've gathered a bit about her at this stage: \n \n pretty serious dementia/alzheimer's - she'll forget what you spoke about 1 minute prior, doesn't know who I am despite daily chats, knows who she is and can chat a bit about her early life but isn't really all there. \n \n \n Lives alone - She was married but her husband passed away, no children, no siblings. No clubs and not part of a church. Only relative I know about is a cousin  \n \n \n Grew up and lived in Kent somewhere and was a special ed school teacher for autistic children. Not originally from London, the house she lives in was her grandmothers. \n \n \n She gets meals delivered to her. There must be someone coming in to clean her house because it's spotless and she seems well dressed and healthy enough for her age despite the dementia. I've also heard someone taking her bins from her back garden to the front garden for garbage day, so she must have some outside care coming in on a regular basis.  \n \n She's a really sweet lady and really likes to stand out in her front garden and chat with anyone who will stop and speak with her. So I stop and have a chat with her whenever I see her. Despite this, I'm really worried about her living on her own at this stage. \n Last night she rang my doorbell around 9pm because she was lost and didn't know where she lived. I brought her back to her house (her front door was wide open - it's always wide open unless it's night time...) and made her a cup of tea and kept telling her that this was her house. I was trying to be super friendly about it all so she'd calm down. I showed her around and pointed at pictures of her deceased husband and some of the pictures of cats she used to have, and turned on all the lights and stuff, so she eventually agreed that yes, she did live here. I sat with her for about half an hour and watched tv and chat for awhile just to make sure she wouldn't take off again in the dark.\nShe had her cousin's name and phone number written on her notice board in the kitchen, so I took that down. \n I'm not sure what to do at this stage. I'm friendly with this lady, but I don't really know her and I don't want to overstep... She also has no idea who I am despite our regular chats. I tell her my name every time I see her, but it doesn't stick. Should I call the cousin? Surely they must be as old/older than she is? Call the council (social services)? Just keep an eye on her and go over for tea sometimes? I can't stand the thought of her over there on the other side of the wall that lonely and confused and alone. What if she gets lost again and we're not home next time? \n She also leaves her front door wide open all day on a high traffic street and would let anyone into her house if they opened the gate. It's a fairly safe area of west London, but anyone could go in and rob her if they wanted to. I keep telling her to close her door, but on the other hand, she's locked herself out plenty of times, so maybe it's better to leave it open.

Hi fellow redditors, this is my first post btw! \n I'm doubting my career choice and I feel like I need advice from a neutral party. Let's start with a bit of the background story. I'm sorry in advance if my english is a bit off, I'm a French Canadian. \n I'm a 23 years old boy and I have a job for the government of Canada that pays well with a lot of social advantages (insurance, healthcare, etc). I got out of school and plugged in this job. There is a lot of oppurtinities to step up the ladder in the field I work in but I don't really like the job, it's mundane and repetitive. I studied 3 years for a place in that field and it feels like I'd be wasting all this if I change career. \n I've always been interested in teaching so last week I went to the school where my sister teaches to see what it would be like. I fell in love! I liked it so much! I didn't really see all the hard work they do outside of work though. The planning, correcting, etc. If I want to teach, I have to go back to school for 4 years to get a bachelors degree. \n I also have the opportunity to teach english abroad for a year which would give me a good idea if I like teaching AND be quite the adventure. \n Now I'm torn in all this and I'm lost. \n My parents are telling me to keep this job because it's secure, pays well, has a lot of opportunities and has insurance. \n My friends are telling me to go teach abroad for a year. It would give me a break and allow me to see other things on top of having an adventure. \n I thought of going back to school to get that bachelors degree and be a teacher but it's a huge investment. What if I end up not liking it?	version: \n I have 3 options: \n Keep my job which is boring but secure, well payed, etc. \n Go back to school for a bachelors degree in teaching. (Or whatever I find interesting) \n Go teach english abroad for a year to have a break and an adventure. \n Or does anybody have another suggestion?	329	51	needadvice
Hello Redditors, \n I will be moving soon to a new area (Kelowna, BC area) and will have to make a choice. My work will be in smaller town, about 20 minutes outside of Kelowna. However the town has about 10000 people where as Kelowna has about 80k (and around 130k in area) My job is on call, I am a paramedic and make $2 an hour, so being in Kelowna I will have to commute to the area within the station which is approx 10 minutes (actual station is located 20 minutes) and hang around the area. So basically i'd have to stay at the station for the shift. If no calls come in I don't make money (make $24 in 12 hrs). Now if I lived in the small adjacent town (Lake Country, BC), I would be able to sleep in when the call comes in and only be about 2-5 min away from the station. So I could stay at home and even sleep through on-call shifts. I really would wanna be in downtown Kelowna and walk to all the activities, events and parks. Go to yoga and dance. Be able to get around without a car. But that means commuting to work for possibly no calls. Or I could live in small town and drive to hobbies ( it will be 10-20 min drive). I am also looking to buy a condo so I am looking into investment opportunities downtown Kelowna vs small town Lake Country.	On call job doesn't gurantee income, i am paid by hour. Live close to work in small town so can respond to work from home, or live in downtown bigger city and commute to work for possibly nothing/hang around small town and be bored. Have to be within the respond area which is 10 minutes. \n What do you think?	249	59	needadvice

"I'm a PhD student in a specialized field of electrical engineering right now, and let me tell you, it's not all it's cracked up to be. I've spent my whole life dreaming of this exact spot where I am, and it's exactly the opposite of what I thought it would be. \n I'm sure some of you out there are familiar with this, but let me just say it to be clear: Every decision I've made since high school was to get here. Tens of thousands of dollars (yes, you read that right) have been spent by me, my parents, and the Canadian federal government to get me here. It's mind-boggling to think that I've spent the last 20 years in school... all in vain. \n It is incredibly frustrating. I've studied the newest manufacturing processes. I've studied bleeding-edge microrobotics. Hell, I even took a course or two in nuclear engineering. And still, I find myself lacking motivation. The dissonance involved in going to work is soul-shattering. I go through highs and lows: Some days, I think I might find this niche, this little spot of expertise that appeals to me, that I could make it mine, the way my colleagues seem to have done. But then I find that ""nobody's interested in that"", which, of course, leads back to funding problems. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy the studying and the classes and learning about technologies that the common public won't see for another 10 years, if ever. But I know that can't last forever, and it's high time I move to the next level and make some technology of my own. As my Dad would say, it's time to shit or get off the pot. \n Argh. \n So here I sit, 4:25 AM, unable to sleep because I face the prospect of another semester of evading my boss and struggling through high-level electrical engineering classes (I'm a mechanical engineer, actually, I was accepted to this department by a bunch of fancy hand-waving). It makes me wonder, what  would  I be good at? My Dad used to be a high school teacher, back when dinosaurs ruled the earth, and I've always thought I had a particular gift for teaching. No, I can't do that, high-school teachers get paid next to nothing and their curriculum is at the mercy of the provincial government. What about actually doing what mechanical engineers are supposed to do? I spent one summer working as a Research Assistant in an R&D lab, and HOLY CRAP did I have fun. I came back and asked my professors how I would go about doing that for a living, and they told me I'd need a PhD. Back to square one. I despise the thought of being a CAD monkey, I tried that once. The boredom nearly killed me. It was like living in a Dilbert strip, without the humor. \n At this point, I'm open to wild suggestions. Surprise me. I'm looking for that light-bulb idea that I've never even dreamed of, and who knows, maybe you could change my life. \n I'd like to mention that right now, I'm living in Atlantic Canada, frozen wasteland that it is, and 90% of my family lives here too. I know it limits my career opportunities, and I'm not completely averse moving. Hell, I might even consider moving  back  to the States, for the right money (I got my MSc in the US). I've recently met a girl who might be the one, who knows, and I don't think she particularly cares for this little corner of Canada, either. So, put those batshit-crazy ideas into little pixel form and send 'em my way. I'm very quickly running out of ideas of my own."	Smart kid, poor career choice.

Hey everyone! \n Well, my favorite aunt passed away 2 days before Christmas, this leaves only my dad on that side of the family and I took it pretty hard. After all the paperwork was said and done, we found out she had a large sum of money invested and I was in the will. \n Here's the question: How can I invest this money responsibly?

I'm 16 year old male and I barley get out of the house, I only go to school or somewhere with my family. I'm very lazy unless I put my mind to something. I don't exercise and have no hobbies, or friends. My family moved to a different state last year and I lost all contact with my friends in the previous state. I go to a really small school and everybody there is nice to me but will not let me into thier little cliques I'm really shy and inverted, so it's hard for me to make friends but I did put in some effort into trying to make at least one friend. I'm an interesting person but whenever somebody talks to me my brain enters potato mode and become very awkward and could barely talk. I'm the type guy who has no problem doing an interview or public speaking but struggles with normal interactions. For example if there was a party I'm that guy all alone in the corner. I'm also kind of ugly so people kind of avoid me. I know if I have friends a lot my problems will be solved, but where can I find like minded people? Agian I'm really shy and inverted so how do I go about meeting them? I can't just join a club and start talking to people, my shyness and my fear of rejection won't allow me. Any useful advice?

Title gives the gist, here's the devil in the details. I work at a sort of vocational school. If you are sick, you're supposed to call it in. That's because they need to find a substitute instructor or just postpone the class. Well, one morning I woke up, felt like crap, and called the office. The person I talked to actually wasn't in admin but is one of my colleagues. Why she was answering the phones, I don't know. As she was asking me questions about not coming in to work (feel like I'm gonna puke, don't think its a good idea for me to speak in front of office executives) when suddenly--I puke. On the phone. So she quickly relayed my condition to the staff, they need to get a sub trainer pronto. \n I have laryngitis and some kind of flu. As soon as I can start talking and I don't feel like my insides are on fire, I email the office to let them know I am coming to work that day.\nThis coworker sits in the cubicle next to me. I apologize to her and tell her how embarrassed I was she had to deal with all on the phone. But she doesn't even look at me or acknowledge I am there.\nNormally, I'd say 'eff it' and get back to work. However, she is a nice person and we often chat because we sit together. We are work colleagues and professional but also have a civil relationship. No romance, we like to keep the chit chat to work stuff-great. But that is out the window apparently. \n Help me, reddit! What can I do or say to at least get things back on track and we can make dumb jokes at our other coworkers expense?

So I'm having a very stressful time trying to decide which university I should attend next September. I've got offers to study General Engineering at Oxford University and Mechanical Engineering at Bristol University. \n Oxford is of course a world renowned university no matter the course, though Engineering is one of the less well respected courses at Oxford. The issue is that I don't want to go there and spend four years of my youth being constantly stressed for what I believe would only be a small boost in my employability. \n My reasons for preferring Bristol to Oxford are as follows: \n \n The workload at Bristol is significantly less than at Bristol as far as I can tell. ~25 hours a week at Bristol and ~40 at Oxford. With more spare time on my hands I could, as well as being able to enjoy myself more, pursue personal projects and join in with more university societies, as well as being more able to just do things without having to worry too much about the fact that I have a big old workload to deal with. \n I love the city of Bristol whereas Oxford just seems like more of the same of where I live now. A large town dominated by an old-fashioned university. \n I would be more able to visit and be visited by my girlfriend whom I am pretty darn committed to. I realise the general advice is to dump SOs when moving to uni but I don't feel that's right for me. I've tried to ignore that when making the decision but it's still there so I thought I'd include it. \n I'm fairly sure I will be able to do a year out halfway through my course at Bristol in order to have a years worth of paid work experience. Many employers are very interested in this and I am very interested in doing it. Admittedly I could do the same thing when I leave Oxford but at that point I may as well just get a proper job. \n I dread going to Oxford when I think about accepting the offer whereas I look forward to attending Bristol for the most part (though I'm sort of worried it won't be what I hope it will be) \n \n And reasons for Oxford over Bristol \n \n The prestige obviously, though Bristol is also a well respected engineering university and no employer I've talked to has expressed a preference for Oxford graduates. \n I would be living literally 200 steps from where my lectures and labs will take place whereas at Bristol I could be a 15 minute walk away or a 15 minute bus ride away. \n Super cheap alcohol in the college bar (\xa31.50 a pint compared to >\xa33 elsewhere!) otherwise though, ignoring catered food which I plan to avoid for the most part, Oxford is about the same price as Bristol. \n General engineering would be nice if I happen to cultivate an interest in another aspect of engineering such as electronics. \n \n Thanks in advance for any help deciding!	Should I go to a prestigious university where I'll spend all my time working or a less prestigious but still well respected one?	504	23	needadvice
"My little brother is turning 13 this year. My parents have babied the fuck out of him, barely disciplined him and never let him hang out with friends; as a result of this, he's an extremely picky eater, anti-social and stays in his room all the time playing games. I'm Filipino and I have a big family, and he's the one who's looked down on. He's always criticized for being picky, lazy and dumb, and my aunts and cousins always gossip about him. \n For years now my little brother has said self depreciating statements. For example: ""I'm the most hated one in this family"" or ""All my friends hate me"" etc. Recently it's gotten worse as he's started to make suicide remarks, such as ""Would anyone care if I was gone?"" or ""I think everyone would like it if I was gone"". Whenever something bad happens to him or I joke about something at his expense, he hurts himself in some way whether it's banging his head against the wall or banging his fists against his head. It's getting me so concerned because I'm pretty sure he's depressed. He never wants to go out with us, he doesn't have any friends anymore due to the fact he's never allowed to go out and he's making suicide threats, basically. \n Even though my brother and I fight a lot, I love him to death. My parents think I don't but that's because they never see the genuinely happy moments between us but everytime I try to convince them otherwise they don't listen. I'm terrified for my brother. He knows something's wrong with him, he knows he's the most looked down upon member of the family, and he knows they talk about him. But he doesn't know why and he doesn't know what IS wrong with him and it breaks my heart cuz no one gives him a chance. \n Every single time I try to talk to my mother about this depression issue, she always has to turn it on me. I'll say, ""He has a problem, mom."" ""Why are you saying he has a problem when you have more of your own?!"" And things like that. I try to turn it back but she won't listen to me, and my aunts are getting concerned for my brothers wellbeing as well. They try to talk to my mother but she won't have ANY of it. I'm ripping my hair out trying to get my mom to fucking listen to me because I don't want my brother to die. I want her to have an epiphany but I don't want that epiphany to be my brothers suicide. I want to start to send my brother to therapy because in Asian cultures, depression is mistaken for ""laziness"" and shit like that so obviously no one in my family can help my brother because all they'll do is criticize him. I'm willing to get into a shouting fight with my mom if it means letting my brother get the help he needs ffs but I, along with many of my family members, just can't get it through her head. I need help. Please. Someone give me a way to get it through her head that I DONT WANT MY BROTHER TO DIE BECAUSE SHE IGNORED ALL THE SIGNS. I had depression myself when I was younger and I wanted to kill myself. I know what the signs are and I see them perfectly clearly in my brother. I cannot let this happen if I can prevent it but I'm only a teenager living under my parents' roof and I can't do anything about him secretly. Please..."

"Hi everyone, I'm a 20 year old soon to be Senior at a well known university and yet for the duration of my school career, I have felt nothing but dissatisfaction. \n Growing up, I actually loved school and did well. I was always on the honor roll, always had great remarks from teachers (which my mom has kept till this day), and I displayed much self discipline in my studies and in pursuing things of interest. However, from the second semester of my first year until now I feel as if my spark in learning (in school) has diminished and I'm just ""going with the flow"". I've changed my major 3 times, have been involved in a variety of groups and have always been very much a social person who can easily meet new people and make friends but time and time again I just feel... Stagnant. It got so bad that I actually ended up hitting a low and had my first run in with depression to the point where I ended up seeking therapy to help. \n But, oddly enough outside of school I'm the complete opposite and I feel as if I'm actually doing more in life and that I am  living  rather than going through the motions. \n As I type this, I am on my second solo backpacking trip abroad that I worked all summer for saving up and buying everything to fund this trip. I have worked my way up and earned a promotion with the company I work for in the summer,  recieved certificates and remarks from my employers for my work ethic, I've been  teaching myself Spanish for a year and have managed to learn enough to be understood, I know how to network, and have all around done things that make  me  feel accomplished in my own way and yet... At school this  spark  doesn't exist. \n My biggest concern is that while I would rather take time off to further work and travel and eventually find out what I really want to do in life, by taking a semester or more off, I'll be disappointing my family who has always had so much support towards my accomplishments and success. \n Can anyone offer any advice or insight? Would time off be beneficial for me, or should I just push through these next two years just to get a degree?"

I\u2019m a bit lost. And I have been for almost two years now. I flunked out of college in 2014. It was my senior year and I flunked out. I needed 19 credits to finish my Bachelor\u2019s and I failed out. I never thought I would be in this situation. For the first year and a half of college, I had a 4.0 (I was a partial Academic Scholarship as well, paid nearly 75%). Even now, my gpa is a 2.81. But I failed so many courses my last year I was put on Academic Suspension. I haven\u2019t told anyone. I just told people I\u2019m taking time off but, I\u2019m sure people know. I\u2019ve been home since August 2014 working a bullshit minimum wage job. Half of my friends are working on Wall Street, in law school/graduate school or some other illustrious career. Every day I regret being so stupid. To make matters worse, I was already 21 when I decided to go to college in the first place, so now I\u2019m a few years shy of thirty (27). With no degree. No career. \n I went down to my former college earlier this month to re-apply. My guidance counselor said I was able to register for classes, so that\u2019s good. But\u2026.my financial aid advisor said that I had to submit a SAP appeal to determine if I could get back my financial aid. A few days passed and I saw that they awarded me a financial aid offer anyway without me filing an appeal but, it hasn\u2019t been updated to show me the actual offer. Obviously today is Memorial Day so I couldn\u2019t call. I\u2019m kinda lost. My school costs roughly $35,000 to attend. If I don\u2019t get financial aid, I\u2019m fucked. My credit is horrific so private loans are out. I can\u2019t even afford to pay for classes part time. It\u2019s like $4,000 a class. If I transfer to another school, I\u2019m fucked. I\u2019ll end up spending another 2 years in college. I just don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m 27. No degree. Dead end job. Barely have $1,200 to my name. \n I\u2019ll hate every single second of it but, I\u2019m willing to go back to community college. Start over. Then transfer to another college. I\u2019m just wondering will I be able to get financial aid at the new college? Also\u2026..is it possible to just bypass community college and transfer to a 4 year now? All of this is assuming things don\u2019t go right at my former college.	Flunked out of college with 19 credits left to graduate.

"First Reddit post. I haven't spoken to this parent in 15 years. I cut them out of my life after enduring years of every type of abuse that exists. My parent is intelligent, manipulative, and absolutely lacks any remorse. My parent is mentally ill and refuses treatment. They are estranged from almost every they know - friends, family, kids and multiple ex-spouses (estranged due to bad behavior, not due to being mentally ill). This parent also has a history of drug/alcohol abuse. \n My grandparents and older aunts/uncles are all deceased, so while my parent isn't on their death bed, they're also not in good health and they're basically the next to die. I've forgiven this person; I'm not angry anymore- I just choose not to have this person in my life. I've never told my parent that I forgive them. This may sound malicious, and it's not - I am actually waiting for them to die, so I know they won't hurt anyone ever again. \n I've worked extremely hard to have a happy, stable life. I'm not perfect by any means but I have a good job and a great family, and I give thanks every day for my blessings. I find myself wondering if I will regret not reaching out to my parent before they die. I don't think I care if it will make them feel better, I just wonder I'd feel like I did everything I could to acknowledge the truth about the abuse, and to finally let it go. \n Sorry about the weird phrasing like ""they"" and ""this parent"" - I'm trying to make sure nobody involved is identified."	estranged for years from horribly abusive parent, do I make peace before they die?	273	14	needadvice
Sorry for the long drawn out issue and I'm on my phone so there might be errors. \n I'm 25 and this past spring I took a long, hard look at my life. I don't like my job situation, even though it's decent, I just don't want to be doing it anymore. Im going back to school in August, and plan on focusing on veterinarian medicine, for the time being. Maybe quitting my current job or getting a second job as a veterinary technician. \n The thing is, I won't be going back full time for another few years given my finacial situation of having to work. So that leaves me with more than 8 years of school, so if I do the math I'll be almost 40 by the time I graduate. Which I'll probably be fine with. Better late than never. Maybe I'll take summer courses. Maybe when I go back full time I'll take on a huge work load of credits to make up for it. Maybe I won't even want to do that by the time I'm knee deep in it and change to something else. Being a vet for exotic animals(specifically for rehabilitation for neglected and abused) is something I've always wanted to do and if I end up sticking with it I'll have a huge hole of debt I'll probably be paying off until I'm way in my 50s or 60s. Which I don't see a problem with because I don't see myself retiring until I'm finally dead, or owning a house, getting married, and definitely don't want kids. \n Having loads of money isn't what's going to make me happy, being able to do things that are dear to my heart while living reasonably by myself is really okay. \n So to sum it all up, my questions are: \n Does anyone think it's too late for me to take this on in my at my age? \n Is there anything that I might be able look forward to in this situation? (I'm kind of going through anxiety think about it all and may need motivation to hold onto for later) \n Is there anything I SHOULD be worried about in this situation that I might be overlooking?	25 and finally ready for school.

"Hey Reddit, \n I'm in quite a pickle to be honest. I'm 23[M] and I'm very desperate for some objective advice on how to handle my situation. \n \n Obvious one out of the way first: extreme social anxiety and a bit of depression has left me with about 2 ""friends"" and I barely (want to) speak to them. To be honest, they just keep me around because they feel bad for me or something. (Overheard this.) \n \n My parents and I barely speak anymore since I moved out.

"I tried typing this post out last night and it turned into a book before I was even halfway through so I'm trying a much more condensed version this time, sorry in advance for the wall of text. \n I am 28, married and I have a two and a half year old. Since giving birth I've been suffering from chronic pain.  Some days are okay, some are bad, some I can't even get out of bed.

The help they can no longer give recently has come to include having a place to live. \n I lost my apartment after my husband and I both lost our jobs. I lost mine because some days I just couldn't (which hurt my pride badly as I have been employed since I was 14 and have a strong work ethic). My husband lost his due to attendance. The company he worked for had a strict policy and there were a few (literally just a few) occasions where I was having a bad pain day and without being able to find a babysitter he had to call out to take care of the baby. Because he wasn't the one actually sick he couldn't produce a doctor's note so it was marked against him and he worked for a corporation lacking any leniency on the matter. As a result we eventually lost our apartment and had to move in with family. \n I thought living with family might help them.to see that this was a real issue I was dealing with and not a matter of laziness. The opposite happened and after a particularly bad week where my mom cited that all I did was lay in bed my parents decided they had had enough. \n That was two months ago. For the past two months my husband and I have been on the streets with no place to go. We were staying in a tent but the police removed it. \n Fortunately our two year old is staying between grandparents houses but the back and forth between the two isn't stable. As grateful that I am that she is out of the cold with plenty of food and a bed it breaks my heart that I am not allowed to live with her. Honestly, that's the worst part for me. My husband and I are cold, hungry and sleeping on the ground (which is terrible for my pain and once the sun comes up I have no choice but to start walking.) but not being able to be the mother my daughter needs and missing out on so much just hurts too much. I can't take it anymore and there is no end in site. \n I've contacted every resource I can think of. They all are ""at capacity"" and refer me to other agencies that say the same. \n I just don't know what to do. I'm in so much pain, physically and emotionally. I don't know how much more I can take. My body is giving out and so is my will. I just want a warm meal, hot shower and a bed to sleep in out of the cold and rain where I can be with my daughter."	I've been homeless for two months and my husband and I are separated from our daughter as a result. I am hungry, cold, in pain and unable to find any help. I don't know what to do just that I can't keep doing this.	601	44	needadvice
Some background on me: I'm a 22y/o guy, I have a couple years worth of college credits  but no degree. I'm dropping out of school because I'd rather become a plumber, I've spent a few summers helping my friends dad who's a water well driller and I occasionally assist my buddy when he works on his car, point is I like physical labor \n I'm currently living in a city that's about an hour away from where I grew up, this area is all very familiar for me which is why I want to get away from this place. I want to live and experience a new place while pursuing a career I'll actually enjoy. The new location is Eugene, Oregon. \n However, 2 months ago, I signed a year long lease, so I'd have to find a replacement roommate AND I'm on the east coast so Oregon is pretty far away and finding an apprenticeship from this distance seems very daunting. Yet, living here feels like I'm just spinning my wheels, because I don't want to be committed to the place I've grown up for another 5 years(assuming I \nlanded an apprenticeship where I'm at now) I also don't think just waiting for the lease to run out is a good decision either because then I'm just waiting around for something to happen. BTW My roommates are alright people, I don't have a problem with them.	Do I try to find an apprenticeship online and move asap or do I wait it out for another 8 months?	235	21	needadvice
Please forgive me if this is the wrong subreddit) \n BACKGROUND:  Recently I have been thinking about what to do with my life. I am a senior in high school currently and I think it's about time to at least get an outline. I have done research, and this is my plan:\nI graduate high school and go to a fairly inexpensive ($20,000 or so a year) college. I will get a bachelor's degree focused on science (what I love). After I graduate, I will go to Officer Candidate School and become an officer in the military. I've heard that officers make about $150,000 a year total (including benefits, etc). After 5 years (or however many years I get enlisted) I'll go to medical school (My passion and life goal). The money that I make from being an officer and the military paying at least part of my medical school will help me avoid and pay off loans.	Bachelor's Degree > Officer Candidate School > Military Service > Medical School \n QUESTIONS: \n \n Is this a viable plan? \n Do Officers really make ~$150,000 a year? \n Those having military experience: what branch of military service does what really? \n Can I go to college > military > med school in that order? \n Any other advice you would kindly give. \n \n Any help is or advice is welcome. Thank you!	157	66	needadvice
My aunt and uncle are pretty old. They're about the age where their bodies are falling apart, and my aunt's the worse of the pair. To make things worse, she's the only one there to look after my uncle and it's building up her stress; she's normally the sweetest old bird but the constant responsibility is eating away at her. I see her in yelling matches with my uncle pretty often. \nThe thing is, she seems pretty resistant to being separated from him for a prolonged amount of time despite seemingly wanting it.	Can you guys think of any way I can help relieve my auntie of the responsibility somewhat?	93	17	needadvice
"First-time poster, so please be kind. I work at a university and am just starting my career as a researcher. Within my department there are various levels of students, professors, researchers, etc. all of whom work on (potentially) very different projects. In particular, there are a few people who have been researchers or professors that are now semi-retired, but don't have the official emeritus status. One of these people, say Fred, has worked in the department for a number of years as a sessional instructor. This means that he is ""rehired"" each term and paid based only on the classes he teaches. \n Since our department is rather small, there aren't many courses to be taught and so Fred doesn't teach full time. However, because the department is small, when the regular instructor for a course is not available for that term, there are very few people able to cover -- especially when the course is an advanced one. This is where Fred comes in: his is able to pick up any course that falls between the cracks and do an amazing job (confirmed by students and professors alike). \n When not teaching everything (and being barely paid for it), he remains a dedicated researcher in a number of fields. We have a wall in the department where people post their recent publications. Almost every professor and researcher is represented on it, along with past/current students. But who contributes to the greatest number of publications across different disciplines? Fred. All without the regular funding that should accompany that kind of dedication. \n Besides being a great researcher and instructor, he takes on additional duties like co-supervising graduate students, co-instructing graduate classes, and supervising undergrads with honours projects. None of these extra things pay him anything, and I don't think that ever crosses Fred's mind. To complete the description, Fred is such a gentle and kind person. Few people in the department are able to have such good personal relationships with  everyone  in the department. \n The problem is that Fred has been talking more and more about how old and out of touch he thinks he is. He says things like ""I'm sure you're too busy to hear what an old man has to say,"" while his body language makes it clear he wants to stay and talk. At the end of the day, he doesn't have anyone to go home to -- his children have long since left home and have moved all over the world. He travels a long way every day by bus to get to the university, although he isn't actually required to be in his office when he isn't teaching a class. Department meetings? He's there. Summer student presentations? He's there. He even holds a BBQ for the department every year; something none of the younger, more well-funded members of staff do. \n What I'm looking for is a way to make Fred know that I value all of his past, current, and future contributions to our department. I want him to know that I can tell how hard he works, and that I his opinions and perspectives are valuable. If I could, I would include him in more of my research to show him these things directly, but our areas of interest are too far apart. Furthermore, he has been part of the department for much longer than I have, and I don't want to be disrespectful or seem like I'm patronizing him."	Senior colleague is highly under-valued. Looking for a way to show them their contributions are appreciated.	574	16	needadvice
Lately I have been feeling incredibly hopeless about my teaching career and it\u2019s getting to the point where I feel like \u201cWhat\u2019s the use, I will always be poor, SUPER stressed, and struggle just to survive.\u201d  I have been trying to figure out what to do with my life and that has paralyzed me with inaction. Reddit, I need some advice. I\u2019m starting my fourth year teaching and even though I love my students dearly, I am well liked and have great evaluations, and teach a fairly \u201cin need\u201d subject, I\u2019m having a hard time trying to justify staying. I currently make about 30k and through the years have taken on second or even third jobs to make ends meet (most currently I\u2019m a server at night) and for most of my teaching career I have been the main or sole provider for my family. The way I see it I have a couple options: 1) get a Master\u2019s Degree to up base level pay 2) move to a different state (or country!) that actually values education 3) take my Bachelor\u2019s Degree (Earth Science Education) and try a completely different field. If I go the Master\u2019s route should I go for another education degree (and effectively be \u201cstuck\u201d in the field) or go for a straight up science degree? I\u2019d be interested in Forestry, Climatology, Meteorology, Natural Resources, Gemology, or GIS the most if I went for non-education. If you got this far thanks for your time and I\u2019d love some advice!	I\u2019m a desperate teacher that needs to make a positive change in my career somehow	252	15	needadvice
Hello! Thanks for reading! \n So, basically...I used to have friends, but they've all moved on with their lives or ended up not being people I wanted to surround myself with. But in the mean time, I suppose I failed to replenish my friend stash, and I find myself exceptionally lonely. \n I just got out of a relationship, and I just got a new job working with only 2 other people. They're not bad at all, but not people in my age group or with much for me to relate to them. \n I find myself having great conversations at work with customers, especially women (I am a woman), and it leaves me yearning for that girl time. \n My best friend (and increasingly prominently, only friend) is busy almost always, but even though we make time for each other, I don't find it nearly as satisfying as I did when I had a few more friends to talk to as well. \n I live in suburbia with my parents. Im currently in 3rd year university so I cannot afford to move out any time soon. I'm 24 and I don't know if I remember how to truly socialize anymore. \n I also stopped going to the gym since the break up, and I'm sort of in a bad wave of depression because of that. No motivation to do anything whatsoever and it's getting highly difficult to function without being in a horrible mood almost all the time. \n So yeah, I suppose that's the best I have. If you have any advice at all, I'd be happy to hear it!	lonely, recently single, depressed female living in suburban nightmare searching for means of making new friends (possibly girl friends)	265	19	needadvice
Hi I'm (24f) stuck in a difficult situation between my mother and my sister (19) and would appreciate any input I can get. \n So pretty much my sister and my mom do not get along at all and since I moved out things have been getting worse and worse and I always find myself in the middle. I usually don't get involved at all, I just listen to my mother and sister and don't give much input. My sister is pretty much a terror to say the least. She is very disrespectful and constantly fights with my mother, way past the point of typical teenage girl angst. It upsets me a lot because I hate that my mom is miserable in her own home however, I can relate to my sister because There was a point in my life where I was like that too towards my mother. I realized my issues when I left home and now me and my mom have an incredible relationship, however, my sister hasn't gotten out of that phase. Recently we found out that we are having renovations done on our house that require my mom, sister, and moms boyfriend to move out for 6 months. My mom can't afford a big enough apartment for all of them to live in and I understand why she is not jumping through hoops to find one due to my sisters attitude. My sister is not without options though, she can either live with me, find an apartment or go away to school and dorm. This decision is where it all starts. \n Basically, my mom had been pressuring my sister to go away to school or to at least go to a close school and dorm because my mom hates my sisters boyfriend. Right now, she goes to a cheap community college that she is doing very well in and is not looking to transfer until she graduates. After months and months and months of my mom bringing up going to a different school and them fighting over it and them being in just a very toxic environment, my sister finally caves in but she does not want to go at all. \n By the way, me and my sister both have a substantial amount money set aside that is ours for school. \n Long story short, I told my mom that it is my sisters choice and she can't control her future and my mom told me to talk to my sister and tell her that if she wants to go to community college, then she has to tell mom herself. I spoke to my sister and everything was ready for her to have a conversation with my mom. Now here is where it falls apart...\nMy mom went back on her word and will only consider letting her go to the school she wants. At that point I freaked out because it's wrong of her to decide my sisters future based on the fact that she doesn't like her boyfriend. Even though she hasn't outright said that, I know that's the reason. The school my mom approves of is way more expensive and will be a total waste of money and then she won't have anything left for her life when she graduates. I feel that my mom is dead wrong for trying to control my sisters future. My mom says she will not approve of her continuing community college and will not pay for her to do so. \n Am I wrong about this?	sister has money for school and wants to continue community college instead of go away to school, mom is trying to control her future and will make it impossible for her to go to the school my sister wants. I'm stuck in the middle of it all	587	47	needadvice
"x-posted to hopefully get more opinions) \n Background: I'm in my 20s and have suffered with mental illness and low self esteem for years. I had legit OCD when I was 13 including washing my hands obsessively til the skin cracked and bled every day, and obsessively checking and re-checking the door, that kind of thing. I was finally able to overcome those rituals but I think the basic underlying problem has stayed with me and it manifests itself in obsessive thoughts now rather than rituals. \n Anyway, my problem is: my hobby is art, which I really enjoy and it's extremely important to me. However I have a lot of unhealthy habits and ideas when it comes to art and I don't know how to change or control them. \n Recently I've been interested in learning how to sculpt. I'm into a lot of anime and cartoons and I would like to create my own figurines, not just because I like to collect merchandise but also because it would mean a lot more to me that I made my own. \n The problem with this is the fact that no one is born knowing how to sculpt. You have to practice to get better at it. But in my head, practice means my attempts have failed, and failure is the worst possible thing to me. I've tried to start small on my sculpting projects to keep my expectations realistic, but they've all turned out horrible and it absolutely kills my self-esteem because I've failed over and over. I know this is an overreaction, but it makes me feel stupid, talent-less, and honestly, it makes me feel worthless. If I can't sculpt, what good am I? If I can't make something worthwhile with my hands, I feel like I'm not worth much if I'm worth anything at all. I realize that's harmful thinking because there are plenty of people out there who don't have a creative bone in their body and can't even draw a stick figure, but they have worth beyond measure to their loved ones. But when it's me, it's different. \n I also have extreme anxiety when I don't make something regularly (like say every week or something). Like if I'm drawing and nothing turns out good, not only will it start affecting my self-esteem like in the sculpting example, but I'll also start feeling horrible that I haven't produced something of worth in a week or two. I know I'm not on a schedule but there's this awful feeling of dread when I realize I'm not making something satisfactory on a regular basis. \n I think a lot of people would say ""well, if it bothers you that much, find a different hobby/give up art."" I thought the same thing and I've tried that before, buy it makes me feel just as bad if not worse not creating anything at all. When I do well, being creative is extremely therapeutic when I get 'in the zone' and it's a wonderful feeling to have created something with my own hands. It's too important to me to give up. \n Any help here?"

About a year ago, I was told by my ex-step-mom(ESM) that my mother accused my father of molesting my little sister while they were getting divorced. My little sister was an infant at the time and I was 2-years-old. Apparently, it was investigated and found to be false. I had never heard anything about this in the past. ESM said she told me because she didn't want me to hear anything like that from the wrong person and believe it. She said my father loves me and would never do anything like that to me. A few months after this I had a falling out with my step-mom and my father and haven't had the chance to talk about it with anyone other than my sister & S.O. A little back story: my parents got divorced when my father began an affair with my step mom. She was 19 and he was 31 and my mother was also pregnant with my little sister. My mother has always told me how she would have stayed with my father if he had wanted to, but he left her for my ESM. During the divorce my father quit his job as manager of the local grocery store, where he made pretty good money, and moved two hours away to a bigger city and started as a bag boy at the same grocery store. Before I moved out to go to college I started to have memories of seeing a psychologist. What stood out in my mind was the large variety of toys the woman had to play with! It was a kids dream :) While moving into my dorm room I asked my mother about my memory seeing this psychologist and her reaction will never leave my memory. She acted very weird like I had surprised her, mentioned something about the divorce being hard on me, and tried to brush it under the rug. I've never forgotten that moment, and after finding this out it just seems like another piece to the puzzle. Growing up, my father lived a few hours away and was semi-involved in my life. I saw him every other weekend until I became a teenager then went about once a month after that. He would always come to the big events like graduation but would leave immediately after they were finished, or sit very far away while he was there. I've always grown up thinking he didn't want to be there but now he probably just didn't want to be around people who thought he had molested his daughters. I'm not sure if I can be around my mother if this turns out to be true. She will have robbed us of years of interaction with our father. I want to know if I should ask a family member what happened or if there are records that I can access myself. I am meeting up with my father in a few days and I would really like to know what happened before then.	Found out my mother might have falsely accused my father of molesting my little sister while they were getting a divorce.

"Kind of a long one... \n I've been going through some rough patches as of lately... Some really rough patches. And these are times where I feel friends are a very NEEDED thing that we take for granted. \n The thing is, now that I need them, they're nowhere to be found. \n These same ""friends"" will have some sort of mellow problem, and they'll come to me. Basically for anything. ""I need a ride to the airport, I'll hit up /u/The209Turtle for a ride."" ""Oh my boyfriend is a dick, let's go to the bar, I'll pay.""

I'm 18 in three days, I'm tired of living at home. There are a number of reasons why I want to move out.\nFirstly, I'm taking a gap year before I go to university. All my friends are going to university except for those who live in the area I'm moving to, including my girlfriend.\nSecondly, I want to help my girlfriend. She's had a pretty shitty life so far and I'd love to do something like this for her. Her mother and step-father are pretty unkind to her and exclude her from things, it'd be great for her to have somewhere to go. She struggles with numerous mental health issues, and throughout her entire life I am one of the only aspects that's positive for her.\nThirdly, I want the experience and learning curve. I know a lot about living alone and would be capable of it, but I want to learn first hand how to pay rent and taxes and manage my finances. I think this is a great and affordable oppurtunity to do so.\nThere are many other reasons, my home environment is quite toxic due to my poor relationship with my step father and step sister. \n The problem is, I'm really desperate to move out and see no other way of going about it. I'm just finding it really hard to  bring myself to leave my mother behind with my step father and step sister. The issue is I would be going to university shortly anyway if I hadn't chosen to defer. This means that mum needs to be able to get used to the idea eventually either way, but for her it is better later rather than sooner. She will be devastated for a long time and will fail to understand. If I tell her the reasonable reasons why I want to move and how sure I am it is affordable (I have calculated it all) do you think she will understand?\nI am 100% certain this is what i want and is good for me, but not for her. I feel awful abandoning her, or my girlfriend (its an ldr) but I'll only be an hours drive away. If anything, this would be a place for her to retreat to if she wanted.

My step father passed away about 4 years ago. My mother has since been dating which is fine but she always ends up with the wrong people for her. She met someone and 2 months later he moved in and didn't pay her a dime in rent or utilities. In the end, he left her for someone else. \n This is not before the wedding ring I was going to give my current wife went missing from her bedroom. It was either that guy or the new man she is going to marry (apparently friends at the time). The rings were never returned and have no idea who took them. \n This new guy won't tell her how old he is (wtf?) and currently works a dump of a job making garbage money. However, he did graduate with his master's in education or psychology. He says psychology but the graduation pamphlet said education. I assume he has well over 100k in student loans. \n I do not care for this guy too much and a lot of things scream scam artist. He just seems....off.

The thing is, every time I open the book, watch a film, listen to a song, or write in Swedish, the the thought of the two of the only people I usually speak in Swedish with appears in my mind, my father and my grandfather. They are very nice people, both Swedish, but I get anxiety if I think about them too much, because I am at a point in my life in which I am very confused (19 years old in 21 days and still living with my parents) but they keep asking me constantly what am I doing with my life and what I am going to do, getting me further into confusion, together with the feeling that they are judging and comparing me constantly, for lots of years already. I get my Swedish learning material and then become so anxious and thoughtful of my father and my grandfather that I can not study in tranquility.	When I study Swedish, I am reminded of my father and my grandfather, and not being in the healthiest of relationships, I get too anxious and stop studying right there.	181	30	needadvice
Hello reddit, I am writting to you quite desperately at this post  6 am hoping I will get some advice on how to reset my sleep schedule. \n This has been hapening every summer, and I want to start dealing with it.

Ok, so I\u2019m an intellectually gifted individual who dropped out of university about 4 years ago as a result of depression, social isolation, and general quarter-life crisis.  Since then, I\u2019ve been working in a bakery for a few years.  Now I feel like I\u2019m finally at a point where I\u2019ve worked through the majority of the problems which led me to quit.  I did very well in high school (30 ACT, 3.9 GPA), but I\u2019m not in a good position to afford university, and I feel like it would take forever to review everything I\u2019ve forgotten from school.  Are there any good career paths for gifted individuals without a degree?  Does anyone have experience with returning to college after prolonged absence?  I\u2019m making a decent living where I\u2019m at, but it\u2019s a dead-end, and depressing knowing how much of my talents are going to waste and knowing how much better I could be doing.

So my mother drives about an hour to work every day. We've lived on our own together since I was a small child, and she's actually the only surviving family member I have left. This woman is my whole world. I literally couldn't continue on without her. \n We're best friends and well as having a mother and son relationship. \n So I basically convince myself that she has died some fiery death, every day. \n Twice a day. \n I'm already at work when she leaves, so she texts me when she leaves, and when she arrives at work.\nI know the commute takes around an hour. But by the time it's been 45 minutes, I'm having a panic attack, worrying that the call or text won't come. \n And God forbid she not be able to answer the phone when I freak the fuck out and call her. I start literally hyperventilating and contemplate getting in the car and driving an hour to look for her. And that's within 30 seconds of getting her voicemail. \n This is debilitating. I'm being constantly slung from extreme worry to extreme relief, and I'm so tired. So very tired. \n I dread the moment she leaves for work every day, and I almost can't function when it gets close to time for a call or text.\nSomebody please give me some piece of advice. I can't keep dealing with this shit. It's effecting my life pretty drastically, and I feel like it's getting worse.	Guy has horrible anxiety attacks over mothers commute to work every day.

Context: My dad was always quite absent when I was growing up. He would leave for long periods of time, and when he was around he wouldn\u2019t really do his part of the parenting. We never really had the most stable, or best, relationship. \n Around November of last year I found out that my dad had an illegitimate child with a woman that wasn\u2019t my mom. Despite all the other issues I would always cave and start talking to him gain after being upset for a day or two; this time when I found out I decided that I didn\u2019t want him to be a part of my life anymore; so when he moved out and went to live with his other child I decided to cut contact with him. For a month or two it went fine, and he didn\u2019t try calling me or messaging me about anything. Around January of this year he\u2019s been texting me a lot about letting him back in my life, but I\u2019ve only replied once, telling him not to come to my graduation when he told me he was going to come to it despite me not asking him to. \n I\u2019m leaving the country for college soon and he found out somehow - I think my grandmother, his mother, told him - so for the last two weeks or so he\u2019s been messaging me about seeing him at least once before I leave. He\u2019s always been really apologetic in his messages and stressed how much he\u2019s loved me and how sorry he is, but recently it seems like he\u2019s getting angrier at me for not talking to him, and supposedly 'forgetting him and the memories\u2019. \n A couple days ago he messaged me saying that he was going to kill himself if he \u2018lost me\u2019 and I didn\u2019t meet him. I feel like i\u2019m being emotionally blackmailed here. I despise him and don't want to talk to him at all but if anything were to happen I don\u2019t want to be responsible for it. Not meeting him also seems quite selfish, if I do, the worst thing that could happen is I have a shitty last day at home, if I don\u2019t, the worst thing that could happen is someone dies. I don\u2019t think I would be able to live with myself if he kills himself and I know I could have done something to stop it. \n What should I do? Should I meet him?

"That title might be ambiguous, but it's more or less the truth - I have struggled with anxiety and depression off and on my whole life, but I went off meds and haven't had a ton of problems for years (meds were making me feel ""grey"" and unmotivated, just played WoW for 18 hours a day and gained 120 pounds).

I decided a couple of years ago that I am going to join the military. Over the last couple of years I have been involved in JROTC, while I know that it is as far as you can possibly get from actually being enlisted, I love it. I have asked my instructors about their personal experience in the Marines, and I have also asked them about boot camp if they ever felt like quitting. Which they answered yes to by the way. They also told me it is the best decision they ever made. \n Well now I am a senior, and am faced with a choice, do I go to college [community college, my grades are bad.] and pursue something I really don't want to do [I really don't see myself working as a civilian] or do I pursue my dreams and join the marines. And I was telling my mother about it and she told me that if I joined the marines she would step out the door and move away and would sever all contact with me. She believes that me being involved in JROTC has brainwashed me to the point that I don't want to do anything other than to go to the military. I kind of see her point because JROTC is almost like a long term recruitment session. But I have always been interested in the military even before high school. How do I make her understand this? \n The messed up part is that I believe that she will cut me off completely. She is really resolute about me not joining. And I really love my mother she is the only parent I still have with me. And I don\u2019t think she realizes that even with that threat I still will join no matter what when I turn 18 next September. I would also like someone who is a parent preferably who have had kids who made the same decision to explain to me how hard this decision really is for a parent.

Hey guys/gals, \n As stated in the title, I've been in the architecture game for nearly 10 years following graduation in 99. I'm nearly 34 now and I just can't see myself doing this for the rest of my life.  I just am not interested enough in building construction and how buildings are put together to keep doing this. Also the constant fighting with idiot contractors, even dumber clients (I know its not just in this profession), and the planners (in the UK where I currently work, you need to get planning permission for most external works from the local government and it is almost always an uphill battle regardless of how small, well designed irrelevant your job is).\nI don't hate all things about architecture, I love designing, coming up with ideas and acutally enjoy deadlines. I enjoy 3D modeling and I am quite good at it, though I could be better still. I like CAD and computers in general and am quite good at using them. I manage the computers in the small firm I am working in, although we do have a consultant who comes in when I can't sort things out myself. \n I've realized that i am not a team player. I don't work well with others most of the time and I don't really want to, that is just my nature.\nI think of myself as intelligent, although unmotivated.\nI am really good at starting out on things, coming up with good ideas, but not following through with them all the way. \n Things I am interested in include in no particular order, computers and IT, law (specifically personal rights in western societies), design, 3D, the internet, porn, traveling, languages, money, history, political history, martial arts, aviation, photography, drawing, fashion (design not dressing up), Anime/manga japan in general, gaming and other things. \n I also do not like academia. To me unless you are studying something factual like medicine, aeronautical engineering, chemistry etc, you are not really learning anything other than one persons opinions on that matter, and you are better off taking a short course rather than wasting time and money getting a degree in it. \n Someone once mentioned I should look for a position as a creative director, basically come up with ideas and other people do them, which sounds pretty good to me, but I have no idea where to begin with that.	Architecture pays the bills but I don't want to do this forever, just not sure what I want to do.	398	20	needadvice
I have a friend with a possible eating disorder. She has told her close friends and family. The family may or may not know the extent of her problem and do not know how to help.

Dear folks of /r/Askparents (also crossposting to /r/Parenting), my wife and I would like you to solve a disagreement we're having regarding bathtime for our 2 year old daughter. \n My wife and I work late on Tuesdays, so my parents pick up our daughter from daycare, feed her dinner, make her the next day's lunch, give her a bath, and put her in PJs for bedtime. I show up after work, scarf down some dinner, and take my daughter home for bedtime. \n In most cases, both grandma and grandpa give our daughter her bath. However, last time, just grandpa gave our daughter a bath while grandma was in the kitchen preparing lunch. My wife was uncomfortable with the idea of this and asked me to ensure this never happened again. There were two reasons given: 1) my dad might molest our daughter and 2) my daughter might some day remember her grandfather bathed her. \n I was sort of annoyed by this implication that my father is some sort of child molester. My wife admits she has no reason to believe this of my father -- he has never had any problems with substance abuse, has never had trouble with the law, and he never abused any of his own 3 sons or any other children under his care. He is a health care professional who works with children and practices with utmost integrity. \n Obviously there is a statistical possibility that he could do something to but I'm inclined to trust my father. He loves his granddaughter and takes an active role in her care (especially since my mom has never had the same energy levels after surviving breast cancer). He would be quite upset to hear that we don't trust him to treat our daughter well. Of course I don't want any harm to come to my daughter but I have no fears that this is even a remote possibility. My wife agrees that it is a remote possibility but despite this she says even a remote possibility is too much of a risk. \n Help us settle our difference in opinion!	should a trustworthy grandfather be allowed to bathe his 2 year old granddaughter?	351	13	AskParents
My girlfriend's close friend died a few days ago, very suddenly. \n Her husband is of course beyond devastated; she was his world. He has no other family and she was sort of the 'boss' of things and took care of everything in their lives. They have a 7 year old daughter, who has had previous dreams and anxieties about her mom dying, so this seemed like a worst nightmare scenario. My question involves her and how children cope with the death of a parent/loved one. \n The daughter was truly distraught when she was told what had happened, and continued to cry and grieve that whole day. But after that, she has pretty much been fine. My girlfriend says that children often react that way to death; they're very quick to bounce back, as they're too young to understand. I believe her, but seeing it happen is so strange to me. \n What makes the situation harder is that she (unknowingly) says rather insensitive things to her father, who is just overcome with grief. She sees that when she does/says certain things, it makes her father cry, and you can see that she is experimenting with this new found 'power'. \n It isn't out of malice, of course, she's just too young to understand all of this. I know all forms of grieving are normal, but is this really how a lot of children react in these situations? Is there anything we can say to her to help her understand what her father is going through? Is it possible she's holding back her true feelings and is hurting worse than we know? My heart breaks for them, and my girlfriend and I are doing everything we can to be there for him, but we also don't want to overstep any boundaries either.	7 year old seemingly 'over' the death of her mother in a day, and is saying (unknowingly) insensitive things to her deep-in-grief father.

For a little bit of background: I am getting married this May. My fiance is working 15 hours away from our hometown and we are doing the long distance relationship thing until March! \nMy fiance's sister (25 years old) got married to her husband (55 years old) two years ago. They have a daughter that is turning 5 in March. Lets call her Sally. They also just had a baby boy in November.\nI live in the same town as his family and have dinner with them at least one time a week. We are pretty close and they consider me part of the family. \n The Problem: Sally is almost 5 and does not speak very well. She is a quiet and calm child, and it is hard to hear her if it isn't dead silent in the room. She can say three and sometimes four word sentences, but they are hard to understand. Basically, only her mom knows what she is saying. She doesn't know the alphabet and she messes up counting to ten. She knows most of her colors and most animals. She knows what you are saying to her, and she is physically perfect (good motor skills). \n The problem is that Sally's mom has worked 20 hours a week tops for Sally's entire life. Sally's father works full time and works random hours (opening or closing for a home improvement store). When they are working the same time, Sally stays with a free babysitter that is a stay at home mom that is watching her own kids as well.  Other than that, Sally is always with her mom. Whenever I go over there the TV is on, Sally is glued to it, and her mom is on her phone or iPad. She updates her life on Facebook so often that I know that she rarely takes Sally out to a museum, to the park, etc. Basically, I am guessing that when she is home, Sally watches TV all day, every day. Sally also has a little tablet that she just got for Christmas. She plays some games on there too, but mostly she likes watching the videos. \n When Sally was three, one of her mom's cousins (who is currently getting her Masters in Speech Pathology) told Sally's mom that she was worried that Sally was behind and gave her some information about where she can go to get her tested for free. Super simple. Sally's mom never got it done, and has ignored that her daughter is behind. Basically everyone in the family has ignored it. My fiance notices it when he comes to visit, but since he isn't around, it is hard for him to say anything. \n I don't have any kids, so I am not sure if I am over reacting, but I feel like I should do something. If Sally is behind, this is going to impact her schooling. Sally is supposed to be starting Kindergarden this upcoming fall. I have met two year olds with a bigger vocabulary and are easier to understand. I think her mom is lazy and lets her daughter vegetate in front of the TV instead of teaching her. \n Sorry for the wall of text. Any ideas what I should do? Thank you in advance.

Sorry for the formatting, I'm on my phone. I'm also about to get very emotional so forgive me if I get off topic. \n So, my son is 10 months, almost 11 months old and he is adorable as can be! Only one problem: He HATES sleep. Putting him to sleep is the hardest thing I have ever had to do in my life! In fact, it has made me regret having him sometimes. He screams so loudly, kicks, wiggles, cries, fusses, hits, pulls hair, pulls on my nose ring! My husband and I get to where we just hold him and pat until he is so tired I can feed him to sleep. I hate hearing him cry like that! I can hardly get him to nap right and when I do he doesn't sleep right that night! It kills me too because my mom keeps telling me that he should be sleeping through the night and all my doctors assume that he does! \n So, here's the thing. On days when he naps correctly, he sleeps wrong; on days when he sleeps right, his naps are off! He seems to only rarely not be cranky! I read all the time about how to fix it, but they all say make a schedule! That's really hard to do when your child disagrees. I read No Cry Sleep Solution and it kinda helped, but not really. It worries me because I'm going to work again soon (hopefully) and can't have him like this.	My child hates sleeping and I'm at the point where I want to run away. I feel like I've tried everything.

"This is reposted because it got removed from r/parenting because I am not the parent lol. \n Hi guys, this is my first time posting here so if this is breaking rules/irrelavant lemme know. And sorry if this turns into a book, I'm just trying to add (seemingly meaningless) details to put the story in context. \n So, for reference, I'm a 21 yr old girl. My siblings are all way older, so I have a niece that's like 10-11ish (we'll call her Kelsey) and she has a 5 yr old sister(We'll call her Emily). \n So, growing up, I was a really weird kid, and still am. I was just really bitchy and condesending to everyone, and hated being around people/ talking to people/ having friends. I wasn't shy, socially anxious, stingy with toys, or slow or anything, I just thrive on the extreme of being by myself lol. \n So, I was living out of state and other things, so I hadnt seen Kelsey since she was a baby, and never met Emily at all. When I moved back near my family, I started baby sitting Emily, met Kelsey, and whaddaya know, she's uncannily like me. She's the same bitchy, smart alecky, I hate everyone personality, and even looks eerily like a younger me to boot. Through staying there for a few hours to babysit Emily, the first night I met Kelsey she started hanging out with us too, and it turned into her cuddling up against me while we played videogames. I didn't think anything was wierd, but my sis(her mom) came home and was ASTOUNDED because Kelsey barely talks to anyone, let alone would cuddle and laugh and play with me. \n So, the kid took a liking to me for some reason, and now my sister wants me to try to take her for weekends and stuff and ""get her out more"" and ""open her up,"" but problem is, I'm a total shut in myself lol. I read, play videogames, and run for fun. I have a couple friends, but if I never saw them again I wouldn't care. I'm not miserable, I'm just the last person she should be asking to socialize her kid. The other thing, if Kelsey's anything like child-me(which she deff is) she would see right through any attempts to ""change"" her or force her into a group. I don't know what to do, she seems like me, not miserable, just weird. But then again, if somebody would have tried to help change me as a kid, it would probably be easier in my life now. \n Anyways, I guess I'm asking, what do you guys recommend to help me help my niece?\nI think some kind of activity or club I could take her to that isn't cheesy but has other kids there too would work.

I have a 18 month old toddler and am on the fence about having another. I'm in a supportive, long term relationship although it would be fair to say that parenthood has tested that relationship over the last year and a half. There's a lot to think about re having a second baby; I have the itch but I want to make a rational decision I can live with happily for the rest of my life. One of the things I'm thinking through is how hard a second baby is comparative to a first. Lots of people say the second is easier, and I can see how that's true because I'm pretty used to living a child-friendly lifestyle now. But I can also imagine how hard it would be to care for a toddler and a newborn. Like, when the baby sleeps you can't do what you want because there's still a toddler around in need of entertainment. So, my question is, how much work does a second baby add, in percentage terms? Like, is it 100% more work (twice the work), only an extra 25%, or is it worse than that and something like 150%? What's your experience? For background I'd plan to have the second when my first is about 3, hopefully.	how much extra work does a second baby add, in percentage terms? eg, 100% more, only 25%, 150%.......?	214	18	AskParents
"My brother is almost 17. He's a junior in high school. He has a vehicle and has not made it through a full week of school this whole year because he just gets in his truck and drives away. My mom won't take his truck away because they live 45 minutes away from the school and she can't/won't drive him. \n He consistently fails at least one class each 6 weeks, with comments from his teachers like ""lack of interest/effort."" I was very self-motivated, and my mom doesn't know how to handle this situation. She did absolutely nothing to get him on track in his early years of high school, yet she's confused about why he's messing up so badly. Her previous attempts (basically just screaming and calling him a loser who's not going to graduate) failed miserably. \n I overheard him the other day talking to his friends about smoking weed. I think he's skipping class to go smoke with his friends. I don't think smoking is something horrible, but the issue is that he's skipping/failing and generally being an irresponsible teenager. I really don't think it's a good idea to tell my mom about his decision to smoke, because she won't handle it well. \n I'm very concerned about him. I don't think it's too late to turn things around, but he's difficult to approach. He has that typical teenage boy ""I'm always right and I know everything"" mentality. I don't know what to do-- my husband, who is pretty close to my brother, is thinking about taking him out to dinner to have a heart to heart talk. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Hey folks! \n Figured I'd pose the question to you all since my wife and I are currently out of ideas. \n Our little one is a great sleeper, but getting her down to sleep is the bane of our evenings. \n She'll be on the boob for a feed and then go down to sleep, and as soon as you transition from holding her to placing her into her crib, all hell breaks lose and she loses her fucking mind. \n Totally inconsolable for a while.

"Just this. If he suspects a phone has been in possession of either me or his mother he screams the howling death of a million demons burning in pure sunlight. I'll attempt to record it at some point as evidence in court. It is horrendous, heart-wrenching, and painful. He adds crocodile tears on top of it. Even when we flip the camera open and let him look at himself, or play a video of himself, or look at pictures of other people in his life, he is not satisfied and yells ""stop"" until the phone is hidden again and he is sufficiently distracted. \n This means there is no longer any way for us to message or look up information if we are in the same room. He has his own toy phone, but of course it's a cheap plastic fake phone with no actual video hardware in it. \n Is there a better way to curb his appetite for bleached LED emissions than to make a designated ""this is your phone now""? \n His ability to take ""no"" for an answer is non-existent at this point in his life. So telling him ""no"" is as useful as telling an angry tyrannosaur ""no"". \n Yes, what I'm saying is my need to be on my phone supersedes my need to keep my boy fully entertained during his wakeful hours.

I'm 20 and she's 19. I don't even know where to start... so I guess a little history for more depth might work. Just one request -- Please read over the whole thing. I put a lot of thought and effort into this. \n We met about 2.5 years ago. We hit it off great and for the first few months things were great. But due to my lack of manliness back then, I never had the balls to ask her out directly and I guess because of that she gradually started to lose interest in me. At some point, she even pointed out that she's lost interest in me. Well eventually I accepted what happened and, for a lack of better words, we parted ways. Well since then I've initiated contact with her during April this year, not out of romantic feelings but just because I liked her company. We've gotten very close since then and I've been happier then I've been by far. Here's the problem. I'm obviously in the friend-zone with her; that's something I've accepted and knew very clearly from the beginning. Despite knowing this, I fell for her again. But this time, I actually value her friendship. I could sit here for hours and explain to you all how she's great and all in every which way possible but I'm sure all of you know the feeling I'm talking about. And here's the final kicker. She's starting college. FYI, she didn't have a lively high school social life due to restrictive parents. But now that she's being exposed to all this freedom, I'm afraid that I will be left in the dust as a friend. \n So... that's all. On one hand, I like her a lot (dare I say... love? I hate that word...) despite knowing my own position with her. I feel like if I don't say something, I might lose her to someone else. But if I do say something, she might not feel the same way and being in the friend-zone doesn't help at all. Our friendship will become really awkward and it just won't be the same. I'd rather have her as a friend then nothing. Is it worth it to find out? \n On the other hand, her being exposed to all this freedom is great and I'm happy for her, I truly am. But as she's exposed to new experiences, I just get this nagging feeling that I'll soon be a part of her past as she finds more compatible friends. Remember, she sees her new friends everyday now but she only sees me maybe once or twice a week, if even (during the summer we met a lot). Is there anything I can do to keep us from being distanced? Should I bring it up and mention it to her? Or is this inevitably going to happen...	"I'd rather have my friend as ""just"" a friend then not at all, but is it worth it to find out? And also, since she's starting college, is there anything I can do to keep us from growing apart? Honestly, there's a lot more to it then just summarizing it down to these two questions so please just read the whole thing."	477	62	other

"Have been brainstorming with a friend who is thinking about going back to court for full custody. \n Scenario:\nHe was divorced about 3 years ago.  Pays $1200 child support for 3 kids (8, 9, and 13) and originally written up to have kids on weekends (not completely half time) in the divorce.  Ex wife leaves the kids home alone for days or takes them with her while she gets wasted literally every day with her boyfriend who fights with her drunk.  The kids have started lying about her being with them so that they can stay home alone instead of going out with her.  She even threw away all of their clothes because they got moldy in her basement (and almost caused her to lose her HUD housing...), and has not bought them new clothes in over a year, as one example.  His family tries to help out, but between almost 1/2 of his wages going to child support that she uses on alcohol (she doesnt work and gets housing, energy, and cash assistance,etc.), it is pay check to pay check.  Furthermore, he has the kids well over 50% of the time, often picking them up from her place on her days when he finds out they have been home alone for several days without being able to get a hold of her.  He has recently heard from his kids that neighbors with kids the same age have been offering to let them stay there because they know they are left home alone. Even worse, he was told that she was seen doing cocaine in a car with her brother who was released from jail only to be re-arrested for drugs recently. He originally tried to get full custody due to issues like this in the divorce hearing, however his lawyer told him that his documentation of the ex wife's various actions including not seeing or talking to the kids for weeks on end whilst getting arrested for drunkenly urinating in public in town, wouldnt matter because the ""mom always gets what she wants."" \n They are great kids and he is worrying sick nearly every week (when he has no idea who's couch they are on while she is passed out or having sex with various men besides her boyfriend with the kids int eh next room) because he cannot get a hold of her. \n So"	Where does a man start in MN to have a fair shot at full custody when the mother is acting this way?

Not sure where to post this but I go to a pretty well known college and am majoring in chemistry, I have completed all the courses for my major and was told I was set to graduate in May if I got certain grades in the courses I was taking. \n I got those grades and was then told shortly after I thought I graduated that I was actually .01 away from the GPA required in my jr/sr hours to graduate. My overall GPA was fine however my upper level courses GPA needed to be slightly higher. I thought I would try to argue my case but after talking to counselors they made me feel like I had no other option. I was forced to repeat a course that I had only gotten a C+ in, due to the limited courses available over the summer. However since I tried extremely hard both times I ultimately ended up in the same situation with the same grade. I feel absolutely defeated and let down. \n I really just want to be done with school but keep ending up feeling like a failure. \n Please don't tell me to switch my major as I do not have the money for it. Also before you assume I am a terrible student you should know the reason my GPA is lower is because a C- at my college is a 1.7 and a b- is a 2.7.

"The comments on this post will certainly be a string of SAP's telling you to make a move.  And you need to, despite the inherent hypocrisy in such comments.  It doesn't have to be anything major - just a kiss on the cheek, or an arm around her waist.  You can do it man - if you have to, have a drink or two to loosen up first. \n That all said, this redditor recently stopped believing that a girl can ""friend zone"" a dude.  It's something a man does to himself.  Think about the last time you were in the friend zone.  If someone hypothetically asked the girl, ""Why have you and SAP never hooked up?"" She won't answer, ""I friendzoned him.""  Her answer will probably be, ""we are just friends.""  There is a subtle difference, but it's an important one.  She likely thought of you as a friend because you never offered her any alternative, and now isn't attracted to you romantically anymore (if she ever was). \n There is a reason for the mass delusion out there that women are only interested in assholes.  Assholes often have traits that women find attractive, in that they are usually assertive, interesting, and confident.  A non-asshole can also be these things - seriously, give it a try.

I've come across some relatively stupid doctors. For a start, I've been seen by many who evidently don't know their stuff in a lot of detail, and the extent to which this causes disagreement is ridiculous. \n Likewise, my ex, for example, is now a doctor; yet she can't spell (dyslexic or not, this is still one facet of intelligence), she can't really do maths, and she is one of these annoying people who spends her free time posting inane, viscous, bitchy shit on Facebook.  Broadly intelligent people have the understanding of why the world doesn't revolve around them, and why this is a bad idea - particularly in your mid-20s. \n All due respect to her for getting her medical degree - it's a fine achievement. But she only got to where she is because of a lot of hard work and ability to pass exams. There's no broadly relevant intelligence involved in either of those things. \n (I should point out, by the way, that we're very much on speaking terms and there are no hard feelings. This is my own subjective observation based on objective fact - it's not skewed out of bitterness). \n Remember that intelligence is not WHAT you know - even less the amount you know - but how you apply whatever knowledge you DO have, in the long term and with limited information. So if you asked her to analyse any given piece of unfamiliar information - especially if asked to present her analysis succinctly and eloquently - I suspect she would only be around average intelligence despite being a doctor. \n Likewise, intelligence can't be quantified. Even some of the most desolate blue collar workers have emotional intelligence which monumentally outweighs that of any autistic mathematical genius.	You can't quantify intelligence; and being a doctor doesn't necessarily mean that you're broadly intelligent at all.	290	17	other
Ha.  I completely agree.  But it's not like there's an international body that dictates acceptable usage of the English language, right?  I would hope that the movement would have a critical discussion in the academic literature regarding the name of their movement and its appropriateness in light of its asserted goals and representations.  Simply having pillars of the feminist movement arguing that the movement should rename itself would have tremendous consequences. \n Simply put, if writing and arguing against the use of gendered language in English is seen as sufficient movement against the established norms, I would expect no less, but also no more, from them should some in the movement decide to seriously reconsider the name on their banner.	Having a discussion in the academic literature and lecture circuit on the issue would be sufficient because that is the extent of the movement's involvement in attempting to resolve the language issue.	119	32	other
I did a search, but didn't really find anything that worked with my situation. \n I'm receiving mixed signals from a girl in my social group. We haven't been very close friends before, but we've hung at parties and around campus a few times. Alcohol-induced making out has happened a few times in the past...but nothing serious, and it's never been brought up afterwards. \n We've started talking more often and I've definitely developed some interest...I'd love to have her as a friend, but if it could go farther I'd love to pursue it.  So last weekend she invites me to a small party. She's flirty for most of the evening (leaning her head on me, making sexual jokes, playing with my hair, complimenting me, pulling a blanket over just the two of us, etc) and I'm just as flirty back....however, with alcohol I become very...touchy. I spend basically the entire evening with my hands on her (mostly just like rubbing her shoulders). She never complains or asks me to stop or seems uncomfortable, but she doesn't really encourage it either (as in, if I move my hand away she wouldn't follow it with her body or ask me to keep going).  I move in close a few times, to see if she will kiss me but she doesn't. (We're still with people, so part of me thinks that's a PDA thing). \n Well, people start going to sleep and she cuddles up next to me on the floor and I continue to rub all over her until we pass out.  Sometime into the night we all play Chinese Firedrill...so I end up on a couch and she, instead of taking another open space on the floor, squeezes on to the couch with me. \n After everyone else has passed out we end up making out again, but we're both definitely sober by now. However in the morning she acts like it never really happened (other people were awake, so maybe a PDA thing again?) But, a few days later we're hanging out with friends and I offer to give her a ride home. We leave as friends (saying goodbye like 3 times each back and forth). My hopes are down until she sends me a text about 20 minutes later and just starts up a pretty general conversation. \n I've never really dealt with mixed signals like this...I usually date older women so being all back and forth with this girl makes me feel like a kid (which is both really exciting and kind of irritating).

"A few reasons for people to do this. \n 1) You or someone else is driving less than the speed of traffic. \n 2) You aren't aware that people around you want to get over to \n a) get around you or \n b) get around the car beside you \n I'm a scum bag steve most days of the week because there is a section highway on my commute that is speed trap.  Most of the ""safe drivers"" go 40mph when the speed limit is 45. However, you can safely goes 55 on the road without worry about cops.  What I have to do is cut through traffic, eating up these ""safe distances"" because if I don't, I know that if I don't go 55 from one light to another, I'll hit five red lights and waste 15 minutes siting at red lights. \n I also drive a big truck and tow heavy loads (8k truck + 12k trailer) and I know how hard is it to keep a safe distance.

It hasn't really stopped me from having a solid number of flings, dates, and the sort, but about a year and a half ago I entered a new caliber level of women. The young Professional (23-26 Female). \n I have to admit, it is a bit more daunting than the 20-22 year old.

"Up until I was 14 I was just a normal kid. Kindergarten, elementary school and middle school. No problem, same path for everybody. After that I had to make a decision.

Ad hominem. No allergies. I am a chemical engineer and do not work in food service. I don't feel strongly about my BiL and his eating habits and I didn't expect such a strong reaction from my passing comment. Regardless, I am interested in the debate my anecdote has sparked. Personally, I learned a bit about the difference between an allergy and an intolerance and how each must be handled differently from a food service perspective. \n Allergies are very different than intolerance when it comes to food prep. In one case, the cook can avoid using gluten as an ingredient and the customer is fine, for an allergy he/she must clean all their tools and surfaces to avoid even minor contamination. Understand the difference from the perspective of those that prepare your food. People think its easier to simply claim an allergy than explain their mild intolerance or even their simple dislike for an ingredient. It makes a big difference to the people in the kitchen, because this meme seems to have struck a cord with both sides.	I hope that both servers and customers can understand each other and clearly communicate their needs as I sympathize with the frustration food workers must experience when a customer claims a gluten allergy while sipping on a Budweiser.	178	38	other
A similar thing happened to me a couple days ago. I was cleaning out my desk and I found a stack of cheques. I didn't know if I had deposited all of them before, so I decided to try them all (using the app). A lot of them gave me notifications stating that they had already been deposited. To my surprise, some of them worked, and I managed to gather up $290. A week or two later, I couldn't access my bank account.. So I called the bank. They told me that they had already been deposited, and I now owe them $290.. The guy proceeded to tell me that he hopes I have a good weekend.	never use the app! :p	117	5	other

How much does it cost to get a MRI in the US anyway? Cause I can get 5 in a year and pay $0. \n We have a substantially higher minimum wage and less of our tax dollars actually go to the healthcare system than the US. Basically you guys are paying more in taxes for healthcare, WAY more in insurance, and STILL paying insane amounts of money for healthcare even after insurance coverage.

Location: Albuquerque, NM \n OK so I was in the military. And I was dating this guy. We secretly got married in a court house so we could be stationed together. No one knew it was a secret. We were going to get it a divorce and no big deal. Well then I got pregnant. A few months later we woke up one day and my guy told me I was fat and did not want to be with me any more. He wanted me to move out that very day. I was devastated. He just left and took our daughter and I freaked out. Then he went on to tell the cops that I tried to commit suicide which was not true I was obviously just upset. Cops came and they were nice and I explained to them what had happened but the suicide thing was still enough for them to make me talk to a doctor. I then told the doctor I was fine and it was no big deal. \n Guy lied and told them I had tried this before so they then made me stay in a mental hospital for four days to be monitored and checked over. Guy then said I will leave you here if you do not sign the divorce papers and say he is the primary guardian. I had no family or anything else it was my only option. \n so a little over a month ago I meet this new guy. He is totally amazing. Supportive and caring and likes my daughter and just everything is amazing. So, old guy that is a piece of shit wants to move to a different state that is far far away. And I still want to see my daughter and everything but I am a broke college student in nursing school. I can't afford to be flying my daughter all the time. \n I do not want to move away. I love my life here. And this new guy is amazing and I do not want to lose him either. One last piece of information is in our papers that says if either of us move out of state the other parent has to give consent. Which I absolutely will not do. But I do not want to get legal issues involved because I am so scared. The papers say I was in a mental hospital and that he is the primary guardian. What can I do? What is there to do? I am so lost and scared.	Ex wants to move and I am scared I am going to have to move to that state too so I can still see my daughter often! Help.	420	28	other

"The apartment I moved into is furnished, including a bed (frame, box spring, mattress). When I move in a week ago, the provided bed was stained and smelly. I had a mattress from my previous place in the moving truck that was intended to be moved permanently into a family member's place, so I moved the dirty bedding to the side and moved in my mattress/box spring/frame so I'd have somewhere clean to sleep. The next day I went to sign the lease and discuss the bed, but the woman (""Janet"") who manages my apartment wasn't there for the meeting we scheduled and had someone else there in her place (without warning). \n I sent Janet an email describing the bed, complete with pictures of the stains. Instead of having someone remove it, she had people come to clean it. They didn't come until later that week (meaning that if I didn't have my own bed I'd have nowhere clean to sleep for a week). Despite going over the stains five or six times (the cleaners' words), the dark yellow/brown stain remained. I sent updated pictures to Janet, and she basically shrugged the situation off. I tried calling three different times but each one went to voicemail, so I sent a thorough email explaining that I moved my own mattress in to have somewhere clean to sleep and the apartment's bed is taking up the rest of the room. In fact, it's taking up so much space that I can't even unpack. I explained that it wouldn't be feasible to keep the apartment's mattress/box spring/frame at the side of my small room for the entire year. She replied saying that if I want it gone I should move it myself (at my own cost) to a storage place for the year (at my own cost). Her reasoning is that the property management has nowhere to store the dirty mattress. I don't see any parts of the lease that discuss furniture, so I've come here. Sorry if this isn't very coherent; I'm really frustrated over this. Ethically, I think I'm in the right. Legally, do I have any standing?"

"African-American hair is  much  different than other hair types! There is a reason why a lot of beauty schools offer an ""ethnic hair care course"" in addition to more common classes. \n For one, AA hair is actually thinner than most others, contrary to popular belief. It is thus, of the most brittle of hair types. The reason it seems so thick is because more hair per square inch grows on the scalp. \n The hair is mostly always curled in either a kinky or coily manner. Think of crinkle-cut french fries, or the thin piece of coiled metal that is found inside a ball-point pen. Since it isn't a ringlet or tight wavy-curl, when brushing the hair it can be extremely difficult or near-impossible to get a comb through it, and even harder to do so without breaking off the hair or causing physical pain. One of the best options is often to comb it with a wide-toothed comb while it's wet. Using a tighter-tooth while it's wet or dry will cause breakage. \n Also, the hair grows in such tight curls at the very start of the hair, at the root. You'll see a lot of curly-haired girls have a half inch+ or so of relatively straight hair before the curls begin. For black girls, the curls often start directly at the root, which also makes combing a pain. When brushing it, you have to be firm-handed and detangle all the way. It's often safer to start at the bottom and work your way up, then firmly brush down to detangle. \n Black hair is also very moisture-hungry! It needs to be kept moisturized, and generally needs to not be washed often. It gets dry very easily, so it needs to be deep-conditioned, with oils that actually permeate the hair shaft like tea tree oil. Most oils only coat the outer layer. It does not need to be washed as often as other hair types. I get mine washed every two weeks. YMMV. The oils the scalp produce are very important and are to be kept. A lot of parents with black children wash their hair too much or over-moisturize it at the scalp, which isn't good either. A healthy scalp will produce its own. \n You see a lot of black women who have  very  little hair; it's longish but thin and unhealthy-looking, broken off and damaged from relaxers, dye jobs and excessive heat styling with flat irons and the like. A lot of parents cave and chemically relax their child's hair because the fight against the kinks and nappiness are wearisome. This is the reason a lot of black women feel the need to wear wigs and weaves because of the damage to their hair, which can sometimes be irreparable. Or you'll see that woman with the sorry-ass, thin, greased-back pontail the size of a rew cotton balls that they spread out like a fan in an attempt to make it look to be made of more than it is. \n Also, at night it is best to sleep with a satin-esque scarf 'round the head or a pillowcase of similar material. Helps to keep the oils where they belong: on the scalp and hair. Rolling around bare-headed against cotton/poly sheets is a great way to dry that shit up and cause damage. When taken care of correctly though, black hairstyles can keep like a champ!"	Black hair is very difficult to work with, style and maintain if you don't know what you are doing. It is very different from other hair types and needs a different kind of care than other ethnicities. Lack of knowledge can lead to breakage, thinning, bald spots and other awful sorts of damage.	564	53	other
This same thing happened to me and it's not that the strings are too long, it's that they're too short. My bf kept hitting the strings and when I went in thinking they needed cut, the doc said the IUD had actually migrated further in and the strings were really short and poking out right where the dick would hit in certain positions. They softened and my uterus tilted (TMI, right?!) and it's not a problem any more (10 months later).	Probable that they're too short, not too long.	81	8	other
I just posted this to /r/malefasionadvice , and then I found this place \n Hello, I am 28 and completely clueless when it comes to fashion, even more clueless when it comes to hair. I read the sidebar on hairstyles, but it didn't seem to help me much. \n I have been shaving my head since I was 15 (mostly with clippers w/o attachment, but the last few years I just used a razor). Since about the middle of October I decided it was time for a change and started growing out my hair. Only problem is that I have no real plan for it, and have no idea what to do with it. \n For reference, [here]( is a picture from a few months ago, with shaved head. [Here]( are some pictures of me now. \n I like having hair now, and I think it looks better. I have actually received some compliments, which is not something I am used to at all, so that is a pretty good ego boost. \n At this point I feel really awkward with it, though. It sometimes seems like it sticks straight out into some awful looking mini afro (especially right after a shower). I feel like I should do something with it (like get it cut somehow), but if I went somewhere I wouldn't even know what to ask for. Then again, maybe it is just going to look silly for a while until it grows out more. \n I was thinking of growing it out longer, so I could part it somehow... but really I have no idea what will look good. So I am open to all suggestions, really. \n So, what do you think I should do?

So, here's the situation. I, a 21 year old male, was recently (about 3 months ago at time of writing) dumped from a pretty long (and somewhat serious) relationship, and it kinda turned my life upside down for a while. \n During this time, a good female friend of mine whom I've known for about 3 years (we will call her Sara)  has been texting me, helping me get through the emotions and find a new job. (depression hit me super hard and I got fired. I'm not super proud of it, but it's too late to change it now) \n As it turns out, in nearly the same timeframe, Sara herself went through a difficult breakup, so we were kinda being emotional support for each other. \n This is where my concern lies. I've known Sara for a while, and I suspect there may be a bit of a spark between us, but I'm hesitant to ask her on a date, as we are both still pretty freshly out of a part of our lives where we were both a bit emotionally vulnerable. \n I guess I'm just not sure on the etiquette when it comes to asking out someone that was recently dumped. Or when you yourself were recently dumped. I'm not concerned about rejection, I just don't want to mess things up between us as friends.	A friend of mine and I both were recently dumped and I kinda want to ask her out but I don't know if it's a terrible idea or not.	225	29	other
The area I live in has a company that uses unmarked cabs. We are all ready to go out last Saturday night when the first car pulls up to the house. After a few minutes of everyone gathering their things I decide to go outside just to assure that the car wouldn't leave. I walk out before anyone else, get into the car and begin talking. A few seconds later I look over to see a girl around my age with her phone in hand staring at me. She was not the cab, and was simply just waiting for her friend at another house. \n After apologizing profusely I got out and went back inside pretty embarrassed.

"Does anyone have experience with anything like this or know what my legal rights in the situation are??\nIm 18 &amp; just moved into my new apartment a month ago with my boyfriend(20) and best friend(18).  Rent is $880 a month &amp; the only reason I was okay with paying this ridiculous amount was because it would be split between the 3 of us &amp; we moved in when they had a promotion running that gave us the first month rent free. We had to put down a deposit for the amount of one months rent since none of us have credit, but the lady at the leasing office told us that that money would cover July's rent, and August would be our free month. Yesterday was 10 days into August(our ""free month"") &amp; we get a call saying that we are in the process of being evicted for not paying August's rent... They only contacted my boyfriend &amp; he was first told we would have to pay $1196, PLUS court filing fees IF we get filed on, which had not happened yet, then when my best friend and I went down to the office right after my he told us that, we were told a different amount($980).  So my boyfriend goes to the office after work, had scrambled to pull money from all of our college &amp; personal savings while he was at work, had $980 prepared(what the office rep told my friend and I we owed) &amp; they wouldn't take it because at that point(2 hours after calling us) they had filed and now we owed $1196, so we had to wait until today to get a check from my mom to help us out.  THEN when we went in to clarify the amount this morning a different lady told us $980 again, telling us she didn't know why my boyfriend was told a number other than that, so we got the $980 money order &amp; tried to turn it in, &amp; there was a different lady there(the manager) who said that it, in fact, would be $1196.. They accepted our $980 &amp; are making us pay the $141 &amp; $75 for court fees in addition.  When I mentioned that we didn't get a notice for about the third time she said she would waive the $75 processing fee, but wouldn't waive the $141... Does that make sense? What was her reason for only waiving one of the fees?  I understand that we messed up and trusted what the lady said over what we signed in the lease, so we paid the late fee on top of rent, but I don't think we should be held accountable for their court filing fees since, first, we didn't receive any sort of written or verbal notice regarding late payment or eviction before they started the eviction process/filed for eviction through the court, which I believe is illegal in Indiana(not sure, can anyone help clarify that?), and second, with two hours notice we came up with the amount that was asked for to 2/3 roommates(980) in full &amp; tried to pay them(they said they wouldn't file if we paid that day) &amp; they filed anyways.. On TWO HOURS NOTICE. \nCan anyone help me?  Do I have to pay the court fees since we were under the impression that this was our free month and we never got a late payment/eviction notice??\nSorry if this seems scrambled and confusing..

I'm an 18 male and I just entered my freshman year. I pretty much always been a little nervous around girls throughout my school life (though I still had a few relationships), and I haven't really done anything about that, as I'm just trying to fit in and make sure I'm accustomed to my new life. Still, finding someone would be really nice, I didn't really have some sort of plans. For reference, I was so nervous around girls that I didn't want them to approach me, thus I tried being a little more quiet at school (I was one of the louder ones, but toning it down would later hurt my social life), I was also a little more on the good-looking side (not meaning anything, seriously) and so I tried getting acne so I would look ugly.. which sounds incredibly stupid now. \n Anyways, the other day, a cute girl whom I have seen around the same area as I eat at approached me (we both sit alone and study while eating), where we had some simple talk (to which I kinda screwed up because of my nervousness). I would later see her around more often than usual (coincidence? I hope so..) and would notice her trying to catch my attention (ex. coughing loudly as I passed her, which was super obvious and sorta cute too, or just quickly glancing at me before looking away). So, my question is, how would you, personally, approach her? Just for reference, as I have no idea what I should be doing (which is also the cause of my nervousness, I don't know what I'm supposed to do to further the conversation and keep her entertained).

Having just done my first year of US taxes after 12 years of letting my company/Government take care of it for me back in Ireland, I disagree.  There seems to be a great fear of the IRS here, to the point that when I suggested to my wife that we call them to ask them a question she almost fell out of her chair.  The Irish revenue on the other are incredibly approachable. \n You get a P60 document at the end of every year which is sort of like a W2 here.  Each year I request a P21, which is a balancing statement and is essentially an audit of that years taxes.  Generally speaking it either balanced out exactly or I had overpaid slightly.  In some cases i've heard of people underpaying but they are generally accommodating in getting that money back.  I've never minded overpaying, since i'll get the money back at the end of the year.  If I was financially short I may have taken more of an interest in getting it right on a per pay cheque basis.

"Okay, so I want to apologize in advance for what may end up a wall to text, but it's necessary to get the full scope. \n My brother and sister-in-law are in the middle of a divorce and decided to share custody of the kids (17 and 15) but my oldest nephew (let's call him Jay) decided he wanted to live with his Mom. I can understand where he's coming from and honestly, he's old enough to make that choice on his own. No big deal. The thing is, he met some random girl on the internet that's 24 years old and they've been dating for about 5 months now and she's shady as hell. More on that in a minute. \n Jay's brother (let's call him Pete) is going through a bit of a crisis at the moment because he's been threatening to kill himself and saying he hears voices. He's been to a few doctors, including a stay in a mental health facility, and the general understanding is that he's not schizophrenic, but they do believe there are other reasons he's manifesting the voices, including his parents' divorce. \n The situation as it stands is that Jay and Pete are in the middle of all of this and living with my sister-in-law and her new boyfriend and it's causing a rift between my nephews and I. Their mother is basically bad mouthing us and making it seem like she's a victim when she's the one that left my brother, not the other way around. Jay is head over heels for this girl he's with but the age difference bugs me, not because he's getting laid by an older chick, but because he doesn't have a job, a license, or a car. They randomly met online somehow (he said he's not on any dating sites) and she moved from Upstate New York to Florida to be with him. When all the issues started happening with his brother Pete, I would text him and it just didn't seem like him responding to me. He's always put the word ""Uncle"" in front of my name when he texts me but that stopped and he started using punctuation, something he never did. Come to find out, his girlfriend was responding to me while he was job hunting. He had no idea she even used his phone, but he brushed it off. I just think that's really fucking shady. \n Also, My sister-in-law's boyfriend lived less than 30 miles from this girl in New York and they're very close in age. Now they've both ended up in the same town in Florida dating a mother and her son respectively. I understand coincidences, but this seems very out of the ordinary. Especially since they both antagonize my brother. She tells my brother that he's not allowed to see his son anymore and my sister-in-law's boyfriend tells him via text that the boys love him more than they do their own father. \n I really could use the advice from anyone at this point. I just don't know what to do to fix what's going on in their lives."	My nephews are caught in the middle of a divorce and there are two very shady people involved.	519	18	other

"The oft-recommended-on-FFA Corso Como Dels, usually $130, are frequently on sale for much less. For instance, [Amazon currently has several colors for $70.]( They're padded and really comfortable once you break them in. \n In my experience, inexpensive man-made pumps  feel  inexpensive. They're not comfy or sturdy. The synthetic materials typically don't breathe, either, so you get sweaty feet.

I'm sort of the other way around; at work I prefer heels to flats. I bought many pairs of work flats over the years, usually on sale or not-quite-right because in my head they were already second-choice shoes. And... it was kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy. I didn't like them that much, I never wore them, and then I was annoyed that I'd spent ANY money on shoes I didn't wear. They've all long since gone to Goodwill. \n You also don't have to spend BIFL money or buy ""forever"" heels (which is a tall order anyway).

Well to begin with, me and my  sister have an excellent relationship and often so things together as we find each other to be the only people within the house we find tolerable, as we share the house with our parents and other siblings, despite our age gap me being 18 and her being 21. \n now the awkward thing is that lately ive been talking to this girl and its been getting very flirty using Snap chat, basically to put it bluntly she ended up sending me nude pictures, now because i wanted to snapshot them without her knowing i decided to go get my iPod which I had lent to my sister a while ago and saved the pictures on there. (i opened them on my phone and took a picture of my phone screen, in order to not getting caught screenshot them). however i didn't realize that she was logged in and the photos may have went straight to her photo stream, being the idiot i am i fumbled and logged her account so i wouldn't be able to delete, them 5 mins later i ended up going to her and explained extremely awkwardly what had happened in which she was understanding but it was awkward and i got rid of the photos eventually, turns out they weren't even on her photo stream so the issue could have been entirely avoided. and i was basically wondering if anyone had any advice for med in order to make it less awkward with my sister in the future. \nsorry for the wall of text.	got nudes from girl, screenshot them on sisters apple account to photo stream by accident, wanna make it less awkward with her after i deleted them.	264	26	other

Yeah, in his defense, I have a 3 year old golden that was originally in a home with 5 larger dogs (he's 70lbs) and he doesn't like being bothered by other dogs and gets protective of me. I like to take him to the park and usually he keeps to himself and we walk to a quieter area of the park but when another dog spots him from across the park and starts charging towards him barking while the owner stands there smoking a cigarette don't get pissed if my dog snaps at him. I will always try to avoid a bad situation with him and if my dog was to every charge toward another dog across the park I would be right behind him in case something happened even if it was just to play. I took him to the beach a few weeks ago and as soon as we got on the beach another large male dog came running up at him from behind while he was still on his leash, seeing this I began calmly walking him in the other direction while the other dogs owner just sat there calling his non responsive dog. My dog got scared and turned around barking at the other dog causing it to run back to its owner who was still just standing there 100yards away calling his dog.	keep an eye on your dog at the park.

Hello r/Advice, I'd like to apologize first and foremost if this is not the correct sub for this but I couldn't find a better place to go.  I[28 M] moved out to the west coast after a bad break up and a good friend[27 M] from elementary school was willing to put me up.  We have been good friends for many years and kept in touch while we were apart.  We ended up getting an apartment together and when my car died he has been letting me use his.  In the last 6 months or so my friend has become adusive to the point of waking we up in the middle of the night to scream at me for something he could have easily done himself.  Keep in mind that I pay my bills, have a fulltime job, and try to be a good person.  I've found myself sturggling to get out of this situation because of my lack of a vehicle(my friend doesn't work just collects disability).  He charges me so much to live here that I can't save any money or find a better way to live.  These last few months have been hell on me and I need to get out for my own sanity. \n I have another friend who is kind enough to be willing to let me have his couch until I can save enough to rent a room.  The only thing I need is to find a vehicle so that I can continue going to work.  I've been through craigslist, autotrader, the local papers, ect, trying to find a worthwhile vehicle that runs and there doesn't seem to be anything worth buying for under $2000.  My last car was from a buy here pay here and was one of the least pleasant experiences I've ever had.  My credit is just bad enough to require a sizeable downpayment from any reputable dealership and I'm running out of options as well as sanity. \n I've been looking around reddit so see if I can find a good sub for people selling cars but I haven't had much luck.

"This seems so petty and high school. I don't know if I'm looking for advice or just a general survey of ""what would Reddit do?"" \n I'm 29 (f).

She constantly refers to me (and two other Internet friends of hers) as ""her best friend"" on Facebook and in conversation, and seems to assume that I feel the same way. I don't. \n I've ALWAYS been lukewarm about our friendship, at best (kind of fun to hang out with sometimes, don't feel particularly emotionally close, can't really relate to her). It isn't like I suck at friendships or at people; while I'm fairly introverted, I have other friends that I care about deeply and relate to very well and love very much. \n There's some stuff going on her life that she's been dumping on me for the past two months that is really souring my already-tepid opinion of her. The short version of it is that she is making (IMO and from what I can gather from being so far away) extremely selfish and self-centered choices and exhibiting all of the emotional maturity of a spoiled teenager (apologies go to the emotionally mature and considerate teenagers who may be hanging out here). So at the moment I like her less than usual, but maybe that'll change once the drama is over. \n Every time she says something about us being ""best friends"" or tags me in one of those godawful Hallmarky FB ""share if you have a BFF!!11!!"" images, I cringe inside. I feel like I'm being dishonest. On the other hand, if she likes me a lot, then she likes me a lot, so what? What would I even say if I wanted to talk about it anyway? ""Yeah, we're friends, but we're not BEST friends. Just fyi."" \n I can't believe I'm 29 and actually give a shit about this. \n Fortunately, since there's an ocean between us these days, I can at least go the rest of my life without seeing her in person. \n What would you do, /r/Advice? Never say anything? Gradually stop talking to her? Just block her from contact on every available social media outlet? Something else?"

So I (F, 21) recently moved out of my apartment and got a new one living by myself.

"The other day I [19 F] hung out one-on-one (mostly) with a guy [19 M] I met a few weeks back who I'd seen around at parties, talked to briefly a few times bc we have mutual friends, etc.  We spent about half of the night drinking and visiting various friends, then went back to his place. \n We did a few randomly awesome activities that made me feel like we didn't just go back to his place to have sex or something--I wasn't getting that vibe to begin with but yeah, we painted a few pictures together, cooked a meal, etc.  Mind you we begun hanging out at night so after this it was already morning--we had stayed up all night together and the conversation was flowing easily the whole time.  Easily enough that I think we both noticed and he even said to me, ""We have a lot of things in common, even some really weird random things... it's crazy...""  We also watched the sunrise over a cigarette break. \n Finally he ended up saying I could stay and snuggle ""in a totally non-creepy way"" if I wanted.  I did, of course, because that sounded awesome.  Over the course of this very long night I was developing a bit of a crush on this guy and wondering if it was mutual.  Now, even that could be a totally friends-type thing depending on the openness of the person and this is a possibility.  We didn't even get to sleep for another hour because after laying in bed we could not stop talking.  Finally we got to cuddling, and I think we both sort of just laid there not really sleeping much.  I think this because every time I'd adjust (carefully to not wake him up if he was sleeping) he'd do something subtle to pull me a little closer.  Never ""pulling any moves"" the whole time, though.  A few hours into this I adjusted myself and he (definitely awake) put his hand on top of mine/grabbed it a little.  NOW I know this is probably a decent sign that he's into me, too.  But I perceive this guy as being out of my league--we have a crazy amount in common but he's very good-looking and could very well know lots of girls who have a bunch in common with him and would date him.  Or perhaps he doesn't date at all, I don't know.    So I'm questioning it, I guess. \n My main question is this:  would you hold the hand of someone you didn't have romantic feelings for?  In a guy's mind would this likely indicate interest or am I taking it to mean too much?  Normally I wouldn't question it at all but, besides what I already mentioned, I also  mentioned that I was wondering how I should interpret that (while we were already talking about it), not the hand just the snuggling.  He said, ""There are no negatives to it so why not, you know?  I do love to snuggle.""  So... there's that.  Any help would be very appreciated and sorry for the crazy-long post."

Yes, you probably have an anal fissure (or internal hemorrhoids). You need to see a doctor. You also need to massively increase your fibre intake. Take Metamucil ([powder]( or [wafers]( or a high-fibre cereal every day. You should be having a BM every day and it should be soft. \n It sounds like you just had your first tear. This can usually be fixed by increasing your fibre and applying a cream internally that will cause the muscle to relax so that you can heal. To prevent a tear in the future, you need to keep up with your fibre and eat healthy foods (no more McDonalds, large pizzas, etc.). If you don't treat the problem (i.e., see a doctor and get the cream) and change your diet (healthy foods and fibre), your condition can go chronic and trust me, that's no fun. At that stage, it requires surgery (called IHS). The surgery itself isn't that bad but unfortunately it doesn't fix things completely. \n Source: Had a chronic anal fissure for the last 6 years.

Not to mention the myriad other, better reasons for visiting Amsterdam. \n I actually want to address this in hopes of making people want to go, but also making their visit better for themselves and the Dutch.  Here goes. \n The Dutch themselves generally don't smoke, and those who do generally do so in their own homes; it's not very common to see Dutch people in coffeeshops, other than the employees and the occasional stoner.  They don't like people smoking where it's noticeable, so smoke in the shops or somewhere private, but not walking down the street.  No, you won't get arrested, but cops may ask you to put it out or possibly even take it (as it is still illegal there, just tolerated). \n When you visit, explore the canals, and get a map or guidebook that shows the neighborhoods and visit as many as you can because each has its own personality.  Museums are mostly on the southwest side of the canal ring, but definitely not limited to there.  Check out the densest shopping street in the world by following Haarlemmerdijk into Haarlemmerstraat into Nieuwendijk into Kalverstraat (yes, it's one long street that changes names as it crosses canals and squares, etc.).  That stretch also has a great selection of coffeeshops, both on that street and along the alleys that sprout off. \n Also check out the touristy areas like Leidseplein, where most of the big clubs, bars, coffeeshops, etc. are located.  It's crowded and annoying, but worth seeing.  That is also next to the museums and Vondelpark, a great green space that provides a nice respite from the chaos. \n I'll stop now, because this has gotten way too long and I haven't even scratched the surface.	visit Amsterdam, but don't just go for coffeeshops.

"Hey Reddit,\nSo I'm not sure if I'm posting this in the correct subreddit, but if I'm not and someone informs me, I'll gladly move it to the correct thread. Okay, here's my problem. \n I began college as a political science, international studies major. I studied abroad for a semester (in Budapest) which was awesome, but helped me realize that I can't really see myself working abroad long term (which is what I had originally intended to do, as a foreign service officer). I switched my major to English and decided that I wanted to pursue an old dream of going to law school, but, considering that I've heard from multiple sources that the job market for lawyers is absolute crap, I didn't take the LSAT/apply to law school this year (my senior year). \n So, I graduate in 17 days and although I've applied to some jobs, I don't have anything concrete lined up at all. As everyone already knows, job options for an English major are incredibly slim. I applied for Teach for America last fall, but dropped out of the process because of horror stories I had heard and because of family problems which made me determined to return to my hometown after graduation. Because teaching seems like a natural profession for an English major, I did apply to graduate school for a Master's in Education/teaching certification. Howeeeever.... \n I recently decided, as in this past week, that I want to become a nurse instead. Why the drastic change from anything English related? I wouldn't be honest if I didn't say that one of the major reasons was money. I'll be graduating about $35K in debt from my undergrad, which really frightens me -- I'm already planning on moving back in with my parents (sigh), but I really want to buy a car after I graduate. Some more relevant facts... I'm pretty good at science, not stellar (while I'm complete crap at math). In the past I haven't been so good with blood, but it makes me less nauseous now than before. I really would like a profession where I can directly interact with and help people. I also am interested in medicine because of my brother, who is severely autistic (he's 20 and non-verbal). My mom was a nurse before I was born, and she warns me that the job, while very hard, is also very rewarding. She doesn't think I should do it, keeps saying that it ""shocks"" her that I would consider it. I've asked a couple of friends and they've remarked that it seems random, but that they don't see why not. \n I could complete the schooling in 2 years and work during the first year (while I'm getting the pre-reqs out of the way), which is about the same length it would take me to get my Masters' in Ed. It would probably put me back another $20K (at least) in debt. Sorry for the novel, but what can you expect from an English major, right? :). I would really appreciate any advice anyone might have."	I'm an English major who wants to go into nursing because of the money and because it seems like it's a rewarding career. I'm just not sure I'm prepared and if my reasons are valid enough. Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks so much :)	512	45	other
I've posted on SuicideWatch before about a year ago and I'm in a better place now feeling like I have a shot at making something of myself. I just feel so hopeless a lot of the time still. \nI'm 24, male. I don't know if I'd call myself a foreveraloner but I sure feel like it sometimes. (I avoid that subreddit like the plague). I'm not overweight. I wear clothes that fit. I'm not entirely ugly. I drink and I smoke but working on the drinking. I keep myself busy when I'm not at work, I draw a lot. I have a trade under my belt but feel I wasted 3 - 4 years with an apprenticeship in a trade I do not have the personality for. I have no savings. I've never travelled. I have no friends. I haven't managed even a casual hookup in over a year. That last one shouldn't feel like such a big deal but it just leaves you feeling like you're broken or worthless at this age. Like you aren't much of a man. I'm miserable and it feels like I'm really missing out on everything and falling behind and soon it'll be too late. Like things only get harder. There is no joy in my life at all and my life is supposed to be peaking right? \nI have no idea where to start with finding a professional to talk to but I do consider it and think it might help with some of my issues. \nI was bullied, physically and emotionally all through high school. I'm shy. I'm highly inhibited around women for fear of being creepy or being made fun of. My legs are covered in self harm scars (very very old but still visible) so even if a woman were to throw herself at me I don't know if I could follow through anyway. Pair that with the embarrassment and lack of experience from being out of the game so long..\nI see everyone travelling and having fun, and it's like I'm just an alien looking in. \nI don't know how to date. At all. Never had fwb. Had one long term relationship of 4 years that ended in such a way I was left completely broken, friendless, untrusting, and with no confidence sexually. But I can't just blame that breakup. I've always been a bit of a fuckup and a loser. How can I start to build the life I should have? I really feel like I'm missing out on all the things other 20-somethings take for granted. Where can I start?	I'm a loser and need some advice, any advice. I'm wasting my youth.	433	13	other
You need to let go of the past to truly love the present. If you keep worrying about what happening with past relationships you're going to fuck up your current one. I understand you were hurt, and it's hard to get over that. But if you don't, you're only going to doom all of your other attempts at relationships. \n It's not something that is accomplished overnight - you just need to try to tell yourself it's not the same if you ever start worrying that things will repeat themselves. You're not dating the same person. But you need to let that person  be  a person. You'll strangle them with these outlooks on relationships and end up ruining it.	try to get over it	118	5	other
Well, I was born cross eyed and had corrective surgery back in the 80's.   Sadly, this was before laser surgery or any other non-intrusive methods were invented. \n Meaning to correct the cross-eye, they had to scoop out one of my eyes with a spoon like tool, snip a few of the muscles/nerves so that they would not cross. \n This DID correct the cross eye, but sadly my eyes aren't perfectly aligned as stated previously.   To understand what I see, imagine watching a 3d movie, where one of the cameras is nudged off center by a fraction.   This will cause double vision and strain on one of the eyes. \n It also left it impossible for me to cross my eyes naturally, so I don't have great depth perception either. \n Also, the surgery affected the rods and cones in my one eye (Nerves aren't sending the correct signals to my brain), so now not only do I lack depth perception, see double vision, my ability to judge colours are way off in ONE eye..     It's fucking weird. \n Also, I was old enough to remember the surgery.   Although heavily drugged, I was conscious during it.    I didn't fully understand what was happening at the time. I didn't feel anything but I do remember looking back at myself....	Had surgery resulting in a literal out of body experience.  Now I am left unable to watch 3D movies.	214	19	other
"Hello all, \n Organization is not my strong suit, so ill try to keep this as neat an coherent as possible. If I am missing any details that you may think are necessary please let me know. \n I am currently living on-campus at my college, and am trying to get out of the dorm life. At the start of this semester I found someone (a classmate, lets call him C) who expressed interest in (eventually) getting a place (not likely next semester). Eventually he came back to me and said that he now wants to find a place closer to our college (he currently commutes from his family home) . His girlfriend ended a several year LTR with him so he now wants to get  a place to be able to experience college more. I did some hunting with him, and we found some options, but we never signed anything or said anything for-sure. One of my bigger concerns was getting more roommates asap to reduce the cost of an apartment. We never could find any solid ones. \n So in comes the problem. I recently befriended a group of people in the dorms, and have started to spend more time with them. Lets refer to them as E(female) N(male) S(male), also, N's girlfriend we will call A (she doesnt live up here, but will be moving in with N). the other day, All of us (C included) went looking for complexes to find  a place we could live together/be neighbors at. This is where the trouble comes in. \n The complex we all liked the best (and is by far the most realistic) presents some problems: they only have 2bed2baths available. This would be PERFECT..... it it weren't that C still seems REALLY dependent on me for finding a place. The most ideal situation as we all see it is me and E to an apartment, then N, A, and D to another one (since N and A can share a room). The place also has a 3bed option (VERY unlikely to be available), but even then E expressed to me that she wouldn't feel comfortable living with C. To be honest, neither do I. \n C isnt a ""bad guy"" by any means. He is just a little strange and awkward, not that bad as I didn't pick it up when I first started talking to him, but its starting to show. E (who i dont htink has many options either and is also running low on time) wants me to be the asshole and leave him. The thing is, I know that's what I am better off doing: living with/near all of my buddies would really be better for me and my social life than with C. So here we all are, needing to apply much sooner rather than later and I am stuck on how to proceed. \n Again, I KNOW I am better off with my buddies, but I am stuck on how to pull the trigger on letting C down. \n Have any of you ever had to do something like this before? how did you do it? I still have a few more weeks of class with this guy."	started looking for apartments with a classmate, found a bunch of people who want to live with me and I would be better off with, best living situation for all of us excludes the original guy, want whats best for me, but don't want to be that asshole.	530	48	other
Don't let your dad know, just be supportive. \n I'm kinda waiting for my grandad to die, only because I feel he can't be bothered talking to me (and me to him) because we have little in common and I have to make all the effort in conversation. \n So I gave up and just keep in touch with the rest of my family.	it is what it is brother, work with it, you can't just make feelings happen	62	15	other

They sound great, but definitely have a strong character. I hesitate to say 'muddy' because they're quality cans, but they're a little finicky and kind of deserve an amplifier. If you're not super deep into aural nerddom, I would start with something slightly cheaper and slightly less distinctive. \n Grado sells some  fantastic cans  and those are always my suggestion for people who want to spend a little more money on tech. They sound unbelievable for that price, in a way that is very noticeable even if you're not into nitpicking about frequency ranges and presence and suchlike. \n I also love  these  my main caveat with these would be that they're on-ear and not particularly comfortable over extended periods. \n Sorry that was so long.

You get a gold medal for mental gymnastics for somehow differentiating not noticing something with something not being immediately obvious. Let me break it down for you so that you can quit puking up identity/victim political dogma: 1. There are racist, discriminatory people of every race, gender, age, creed, ethnicity, national origin located all over the world. 2. Some of them will give you a hard time for no reason at all, other than they just don't like you for some accidental reason, i.e. your skin color or maybe the color of your shirt. 3. Some people won't like you because they're jerks. 4. Some people won't like you because you're a jerk. 5. In the end, if the negative people make you feel bad about yourself, it's because YOU are weak-minded. 6. Most of the time, your personal successes and failures are just that: personal. There isn't some bogey man keeping you down or lifting you up.	If you think every white person is punching their ticket to a high 6 figure salary, a German sports car, a country club membership, and vacation homes, just because they are white, you're stupid. If you think every black person is doomed to failure because white people are mean and exclusionary, just because they secretly don't like blacks, you're stupid.	158	60	other
"Sometimes it's the pressure to perform. We put so much effort into wooing you, and now we gotta be casa nova in the sheets. We don't want to fuck things up in the bedroom by not getting you off, cumming too fast, not cumming fast enough, or maybe just ripping a fart. \n I had a pretty severe case of this anxiety myself after getting dumped by a long term girlfriend. I was an emotional wreck and tried to get back into the dating game too soon.

I've offered the same plan as your body shop on big, time-consuming engine jobs. \nIt seems shady, but it just kills your flow when you have to turn people away because of it. \nSo I see your point about hoping for a discount, but I believe it to be uncouth to ask for for one at this point. \nAnd he may discount it without even telling you. \nI mark down probably 75% or more of my invoices when I get the total.

I xposted in /r/personalfinance and /r/legaladvice/  Sorry if I broke reddit's rules \n So, my wife and I are getting divorced.  She moved out a year ago and I have been paying 100% of the mortgage ever since.  Her name is on the mortgage, too.  We were working on the relationship for a while but things are not going well and she is filing.  We meet with a mediator next week.  We are very friendly and maintain a good relationship despite the divorce.  So I would not do this out of spite. \n I can maintain the mortgage but I'm living paycheck to paycheck.  Now my old car is ready to die (rusted out frame) and I cannot afford to replace it.  I have no cash but I do have about $6000 in assets that I can liquidate (4-wheeler, snowmobile, etc).  I also have $50k in a 401k and $17k in a college fund for my son that I'd rather not touch but will if I have to.  My wife will probably get half of everything.  I will also probably have to pay alimony and child support (we will each have our son 50% of the time) because I make 2x her pay. \n I have no other debt.  I have a credit card I use every day and pay it off 100% every month.  I have two other credit cards I do not use; both have $20k limits.  I don't know the interest rates of any of them because I never have a balance.  As a result my credit score is 805.  My wife owes about $12k in credit card debt in her name only.  She cannot afford the apartment she lives in and racks up more credit card debt every month to pay the bills.  I think that means I am not liable for any of it. \n We bought the house in 2007 (height of the bubble) for $240k.  We now owe $196k.  The mortgage payment is $1700 per month.  I have not called a realtor or home assessor.  I would need to put about $3000 in repairs before I sell.  That's if I do the work myself.  It would be much higher if I have to pay someone.  I have no idea what the current market value of the house is but I don't think I can sell it for what I owe. \n So, what happens if I stop paying the mortgage, stay in the house until evicted, and stockpile that cash instead?  How long before I am evicted?  If I finance a car and go into foreclosure can they seize the car?  I told my wife I am thinking of this and she is worried about her credit score.  I keep thinking (I said no spite..)  she hasn't paid a penny on the mortgage for a year and now I'm a bad guy because I don't want to, too? \n I know I should probably try to sell but honestly I have no energy or motivation.  I just want out.  So I asked my wife to invest the time and money into selling.  She is unwilling as well.  Also, I honestly don't care about my credit right now.  Credit is only good if you can finance something.  I cannot finance anything if I continue to stay in the house.  I feel I need cash right now, not credit. \n Please, just assume that I will not sell and I will stop paying the mortgage.  I want to know what the consequences are.  Thanks!	I cannot afford my mortgage and a car.   The house is upside down   I need a car today. I have no cash.   What happens if I finance a car, stop paying the mortgage, and start stockpiling cash instead?	582	38	other
"I hate to be a debby downer because your story is so heart warming but I have a that has soured me into never giving to homeless people ever again. \n One evening I was feeling a real hankering for some tasty pizza so I order online and opt to pick it up as it's about a 5 minute walk away and the guilt of getting the pizza would be multiplied if I got it delivered when it is so close. \n So as I get to the pizza store there is a man outside with his hat out and actually used the phrase ""Hey, can you spare some change so I can get a slice of pizza"". Now because I was quoted my total online (came to about $17) I grabbed a $20 note to pay for it and that was all I had. As i'm waiting for the person behind the counter to get the pizza, dips and drinks together the thought occurs to me ""I have more than enough, if not too much for myself here"" so I ask the person behind the counter if it would be possible to get a separate plate. I take a slice of my pizza and put it on the plate and left the store. \n Feeling quite good about myself I give the plate to the man outside and without even looking at what I had given him he tells me ""Oh, i'm allergic to veggies"". This alone struck me as weird, for someone to be allergic to all vegetables but luckily enough i'm more a meat eater so I was able to inform him that there was chicken, beef and some mushroom on it to which I got a further ""Oh, I can't eat that but maybe I can I can trade it in"". \n Being slightly in shock I left it with him and walked slowly away, looking backward to actually see him go back into the pizza store and from what I could tell, attempt to get a cash refund for the poor pizza store clerk. \n I have always tried to give the benefit of the doubt for instances when you see a homeless person with a cigarette (there is a chance it could have been given to them as I have done myself many times before) or even if they have some booze (it's a tough life, i'm sure I would want a drink every now and then) but when presented with a fresh slice of delicious pizza to not even consider it but instead want the cash for, what I can only presume would be booze/cigarettes/drugs, is just not on. I know I could still be wrong and he could have been desperate for a sleeping bag or some new socks or something to keep him warm but I find this just too unlikely. \n A side story which also reenforces my decision is one told to me by a friend who works in a city centre bookmakers (for those who don't know or live in a place where gambling is illegal this is place where you can go to gamble on pretty much anything but generally sports and horse racing). He had a customer that would come in regularly who he would also see in a popular local tourist spot who would spend maybe an hour begging and then go to the bookmakers and gamble it all until it was all gone and then go back to begging."

"So the story to this one is that I was out two nights ago til the early morning. Leaving a club I noticed some drama occuring across the street and so my girlfriend and myself walked over to see what was happening. I came across a distressed individual who claimed to have been attacked, although in the club I witnessed and heard of the individual being very forward to girls, and getting hot headed at any denial. Upon the moment of meeting him he started to utter racial slurs about the girl whom had attacked him, to which I replied that he should not bring race into the situation and tried to calm him down. \n By this point he had taken his shirt off, a sure sign he was looking for a fight, and so I walked over, grabbed his shirt and offered to walk him home and just asked him to calm down and leave it, but he was intent on shouting out his 'attacker'. I took it upon myself to speak to her, to which a friend of her advised me to calm my friend down as the 'attacker' was carrying a knife. I explained that I was a neutral party, looking to diffuse the situation, but the girl seemed to be in a frenzy, so I walked back over the guy. \n He was still in a rage, but I tried to let him know of the severity of his actions upon hearing about the concealed weapon, to which he replied ""are you threatening me?"" (obviously the guy was a defensive kind of guy). I obviously replied that I was not, to which my girlfriend stepped in to try and help. When this happened, he started to say some derogatory and frankly sexist verbal abuse at her, and so I stepped in, as I was not going to allow this to happen. Being calm natured, I tried to approach this as an advice rather than threaten him, and told him he should ""never speak to any girl like that, especially not to my girlfriend, it's disgusting and completely disrespectful"", and the next bit is hazy, but I spoke to someone else for a few minutes and that's all I remember before I woke up in a pool of my own blood after he had hit me and broken my nose. \n I have swelling under my eyes, a broken nose and chipped tooth. The broken nose and swelling means I am A. not able to return to my place of work (a four star hotel where my boss has told me that until the swelling goes down it's not favourable for either parties I return) and B. have had to rearrange a second interview at a job I have been working for, and this could jeopardise the job for me. The chipped tooth is a pain for me which means I will have to see the dentist to get it looked at, costing me money that I am losing out on due to the swelling. \n I'm not sure what legal action to take against the attacker, I would like to see the guy get some comeuppance for his actions, but is there any financial settlement that I could charge against him?"

If it's misdelivered (that is, there is an address on the package other than yours) it is always illegal for you to open it under [18 USC Section 1708]( \n Sometimes, depending what circuit you are in, it is legal to open mail sent to the correct address, but not to your name. But, even then not always. \n One such example, which I'll use because it does a superb job running through other circuit decisions is  United States v. Coleman , 196 F.3d 83, 85-6 (2nd Cir. 1999) \n >The Third and Fifth Circuits have ruled that \xa7 1708 covers misdelivered, but not misaddressed, mail, on the theory that the authority of the Postal Service ends once the letter has been delivered to the address on the envelope.

The Ninth Circuit has ruled that \xa7 1708 covers misdelivered mail, but covers misaddressed mail only if a change of address form has been filed with the Postal Service by the intended recipient of the mail. See United States v. Anton, 547 F.2d 493, 495 & n. 2 (9th Cir.1976); United States v. Birnstihl, 441 F.2d 368, 369 (9th Cir.1971) (per curiam). Finally, the Seventh and Tenth Circuits have ruled, and the First Circuit has implicitly concluded, that \xa7 1708 extends to both misdelivered and misaddressed mail. See United States v. Palmer, 864 F.2d 524, 527 (7th Cir. 1988); United States v. Douglas, 668 F.2d 459, 461 & n. 3 (10th Cir.1982); see also United States v. Indelicato, 611 F.2d 376, 384 (1st Cir.1979).

"Subpoenas! \n Real life lawyer here.  Incident to any pending lawsuit, a subpoena can force someone to answer questions under oath, provide documents, or allow access to inspect and sample things like DNA. She can use a subpoena to force her parents to testify that she's their daughter, that she were born in such place, on such date etc.  Also demand copies of their citizenship and other relevant papers and their DNA.  All of this, plus her own testimony, will prove she's a natural born citizen. \n But there needs to be a lawsuit going on before you can start serving subpoenas.  And before you can start a lawsuit, you need to be ""aggrieved."" \n So, the first thing she might want to do is apply to ALL the Federal and State agencies you want things from -- the passport agency, social security administration, state voter registration agencies, etc. --- and get denied.  Once denied, then she can bring suit against those agencies in order for the court to decide if she is entitled to the things she is asking for.   She might want to ask the court for a good old writ of mandamus forcing the agency to do what they are required to do. \n Hiring a lawyer won't cost a lot and it will be money well spent.

If you read the owners manuals of certain vehicles of certain years and manufacturers, they discourage either the use of the low grade stuff, (for the protection of your engine) or they discourage/ don't advocate the use of the higher octane stuff because the engine was tested and EPA'd on regular.

Hello all, thank you in advance for reading this post, it means alot. \n I have just finished my freshman year at a four-year university, and it's been crazy. I entered the university as an engineering major, and found out VERY QUICKLY that it was not for me. Unfortunately, I had to stick with the courses I was enrolled in for a semester, and my GPA suffered drastically, I ended the semester with a 1.6 overall. \n Second semester I took more classes that were oriented toward what had always been my passion in high school: biology. I entered second semester with a plan to transfer into the biology major offered by my university, and took classes that were required by that major. However, early into my second semester, I had the chance to shadow some doctors at my local hospital, and realized my passion lay in Nursing. I began to look into how I could earn a BSN(Bachelor's of Science in Nursing) from my university. It turns out that my university is what's called a 2+2 university for BSN's, where students take 2 years of nursing pre-requisites, then apply for and transfer into a separate nursing school which is indirectly affiliated with my current university. This program does not accept students into the nursing program after their sophomore year, and it meant I would not be able to complete my nursing degree in four years at my current university. \n So, here are my options:\n1) Stay at my current university, earn a four-year degree that is loosely related to Nursing. After earning my first Bachelor's degree, I can enroll in what is called an ABSN (Accelerated Bachelor's of Science in Nursing). This program is for people who earn a Bachelor's degree, and then want to go back to school to earn a Nursing degree without having to take all the time of Nurisng School. This program would take about 18 months and would essentially be 2 years of Nursing School condensed into 75% of the time, so it would be probably more challenging than normal. If I go this route, I could use my first bachelor's degree to get a job and earn money while getting the ABSN. \n 2) I could transfer after my sophomore year (~1 year from now) to another school in my state which offers a four-year BSN, instead of the 2+2 program like my school offers. If I transfer there, I would only have enough credits to be considered a first semester sophomore. Also, many of the classes I take over the next two semesters would not transfer to my new institution, so those classes would be basically worthless. The advantage of transferring to the new institution is that I would finish my school earlier AND be equipped with my BSN to start my Nursing, BUT it   would mean I would be delayed starting to work by about 6-12 months. Another thing is, I really enjoy the university I'm considering transferring to more than my current one. \n Right now, I'm currently favoring Option 2. I would love to get my BSN as early as possible, and I love the city and university I could transfer to. The most challenging part of this decision would come in the next year, as I would have to make a 4.0 both semesters to raise my GPA up enough to be accepted by my transfer institution.	I could either stay at my current university (which I do not really like) and complete a bachelor's degree and then go to school for another 18 months, OR I could transfer to another university (which I love a lot more) after earning perfect grades for a year and finish school 6-12 months earlier.	565	54	other
So, 11 months ago I started to date a girl I went to high school with (we didn't talk in high school). She transferred to my college to be with me. I have become deeply ingrained in her family, and I think highly of all of them. Before we started dating, I enjoyed a typical college experience. I drank, smoked, and had random hookups (never leading to sex though). Now, I occasionally smoke and drink, and I always include my girlfriend in these activities. I love my girlfriend, but I never get as high or as drunk when I am around her. It should also be noted that I lost my virginity to this girl.\nAfter about 10 months, we started to bicker about tiny things that no one should really care about. We always make up, but the old issues continue to resurface in each argument. \nRecently, I have found myself fantasizing about other girls, particularly girls I have been involved with in the past, or friends of hers that I know pretty well. \nWe discuss marriage on a fairly regular basis, and I recently confessed that I don't feel comfortable marrying her as soon as we graduate, something she suggested. \nI always pictured myself living a life of mild notoriety, being a bit promiscuous, experimenting with different drugs, travelling, etc. But now I fear that I might sacrifice this for a life that I'm not even sure I want yet. I feel like I need to have sex with more than one girl in my whole life, but I sure as hell don't plan on cheating. I also don't want to throw away someone who genuinely loves me.\nWhat should I do? Do I break a very sweet girl's heart for my own personal story? or Do I sacrifice my future endeavors and start a more tame life with her?	The girl I love wants to marry me, but I don't think I'm ready. Also, I kind of want to see what other girls are like.	312	26	other

Just remember, if it's what you're seeing a lot of, that means it's profitable. At their core, most journalism outlets are also businesses. Since very few people actually want to pay for access to news, they'll be trying to get that dollar anywhere else. \n Why do they all have videos? Easy: \n \n No one's paying for a full subscription, so content has to be monetized individually. \n \n Banner ads don't pay dick, son. You know how many clicks you'd need on a banner ad to even approximate the revenue a print ad can bring in? Hundreds of thousands to millions. On one ad. \n \n You know how you can increase your ad revenue, though? Convince marketers that their ad will have a better chance of being seen by people at your site because those people stay there longer when they visit. How do you prove they spend more time at your site? Why, give them a reason to \u2014 say, a video that keeps them on that site for a minute, instead of text or a photo that they can skim and move on from in seconds. \n \n You know where the real ad money is online? Video ads, son. If you have a video that's already keeping people at your site longer, why not add a 5-, 10-, 15- \u2014 hell, even a 30-second ad to the front? Even if most people open another tab while that loads, you can still say they were on your site for that length of time. That's crack to advertisers. \n \n And why the autoplay? Obviously, those companies know you'd never voluntarily start watching an ad if you could help it. So now you get the decision to opt out instead of in. \n \n But the MOST important reason it's everywhere? Not enough people like you complain, and so many other idiots have decided they  like  video recaps of the text below, or don't realize they're the same thing. Never underestimate people's stupidity. \n \n \n It's not a secret that most companies want to make the most money in the cheapest, simplest way. Journalism outlets know people definitely don't want to pay for subscriptions or even per article, even in microtransactions. They can't make the money from ad revenue the way they used to, so they took a trending behavior \u2014 videos, videos, videos! \u2014 and found a way to monetize it in a way that's super profitable. Then they starting selling ads for those videos and making them autoplay so they have a better chance of proving they were seen more often, thereby allowing them to raise their ad rates.	This is what happens when the lowest common denominator refuses to pay for news but proves it can be wooed into spending more time on websites with videos, even if those videos have ads in them.	430	36	other

I met my now-wife on OkCupid actually.  I went on about a dozen dates using OkCupid and very quickly learned that it was a cesspool of deception.  To be fair, most, if not all, dating websites suffer the same trouble.  Use of old pictures (like 5-10 years old pictures) is quite common.  The worst is the 'slimshot', a picture taken of the face from a very high perspective that can seem to take 200 lbs off the shot. \n Out of the dozen or dates I went on, the only honest profile was that of my current wife and I about ready to give up on online dating by then.  There are certainly a few honest people out there, but get ready for a lot of bad dates due to outright deception.  I can't complain too much, considering the lucky result in the end. \n I sucked it up and tried to show my deceptive dates a good time, making conversation and paying for the whole thing.  Maybe I was contributing to the problem with that.  I'm expect most of these deceptive women are really just desperate for any kind of social interaction, even if its just someone to talk to and buy them dinner.  Of course, no second dates for someone so deceptive.	I used online dating.  Every date but one was deceptive.  I married the honest one.	212	15	other
First time posting, not exactly sure where to post this so please redirect me if this is the wrong place.  I posted it in AskReddit but after finding this subreddit, it seems more appropriate to ask here. \n I'm currently in a dispute with a dentist's office over late fees.  It was a paltry amount, $11.65, but it was the principle of the matter.  Long story short, they never sent me any bills and then call me about an overdue bill (visit was in March 2012, phone call about bill in mid-September). I went to the office to pay it but asked them to remove the late fees since they never notified me about a bill in the first place. Suffice it to say that the business manager was rude and unprofessional, yelling at me that it's not her problem. Had she calmly explained why she couldn't remove the charges instead of getting in my face, we wouldn't be in this position today. \n Since then, I have paid the late charges, plus more late charges that she tacked on because I didn't pay the initial late charges as fast as she wanted (paid bill on 10/1, paid late charges of $11.65 for it on 10/3 but she still charged me anyway. Paid those-$2.26 more- on 10/8). The late charges weren't much but it's the principle of the matter and her outright unprofessional attitude. So these checks, along with letters to her boss, were handed into the front desk where you normally pay the bills. I even brought a friend with me in case she came out acting like a nut again. My issue is now this---  can she refuse to cash the checks to keep adding on interest? The only check she has cashed was the one for the appointment (which I was fine paying- that one wasn't the issue).   In the letters, I basically explained why they lost my business, which I am sure is not going to go over well with the business manager since I basically stated that she should be fired.  Since then, I have filed complaints with the BBB and the Attorney General Office's Bureau of Consumer Affairs. \n I could go into more detail if needed.

"Basically, this woman where I work [Small outpatient center at a hospital] doesn't like to park in employee parking. \n Monday she got a warning ticket on her car because she was parked in patient parking, they told her she couldn't park there and needed to park in employee parking, next time she'd be booted. \n She was LIVID, saying she hates parking in the tower because there's ""Just never any parking"" or she ""doesn't have time to find a parking spot."" \n She parked in patient parking on Tuesday and her car got booted.

She admitted that the placard belongs to her parents but they  ""gave""  it to her, so she should be able to use it whenever she wants. \n It's all just a shit-show. \n So my question in short is: \n \n If she parks in handicapped parking again, should we call the security, or just straight up call the cops?  \n \n I thought the placards were government issued and regulated, but I'm not 100% sure. \n Thanks in advance!!"

You're an idiot. If there's only 1 sample in the entire world as your metric for freedom, you set that as the baseline, you can't compare it to anything and you can't state it's completely free/complete dictatorship. \n If you have 2 countries and one is freer than the other, then yes, it is freer. If you're going to try to compare your fantasy North Korean dictatorship to something, then obviously you want to compare it to the current countries we have, and it would clearly be much less free than many countries in the world today.	You're still comparing to countries that would no longer exist.	96	10	other
I'm 26M dating 22F. So I've been dating this girl for about 6 weeks, we have sex but aren't mutually exclusive yet. I'm older with a career, and she's just about to graduate college. I recently went through a nasty breakup, and unfortunately, my battle scars have left me with serious trust issues. I'm deathly afraid of trusting any female for fear that I'm gonna get hurt like that again. I'm also super unemotional around her, because I'm afraid to show any kind of sensitivity or weakness. \n So that was a year ago and now I'm seeing this new person. Like I said, she's pretty cool. But she radomly talks about things that really turn me off. My take is if I'm uncomfortable this early, is this even worth pursuing? Also, should I talk to her about it? and if so how? \n That conversation would essentially determine our path. If she understands where I'm coming from, and embraces it, then I can see this going somewhere. If not, then...that's that. What do you guys think I should do? \n ps. She asks me about my ex, and I never tell her anything for fear that she'll use that sensitive information against me...like I said...battle scars. :/	Dating someone new.

Link \n Hello everyone!\nI hope the album covers everything that is needed, I have included what my current hairstyle is in the first few photos and have also included what some of my recent hairstyles have been as well. \n The shot from behind is a little blurry but I was having a hard time capturing it.  If the pictures don't quite capture it my hair is moderately thick and wavy. \n Anyways as far as additional information about myself goes there are not very many restrictions.  I work in a professional environment but I don't necessarily have any restrictions for what I'm allowed to wear.  I would like a haircut that works well with more professional look clothes though, such as what I'm wearing in the photo taken in the dressing room. \n I've done the undercut style in the past so not really looking to try it again, except perhaps if it wasn't one that is similar to the style I have in my pictures.  I'm also hoping for a shorter style as opposed to having to grow my hair out.  I do not mind spending a short period of time every day styling my hair and I do use product every day but I would like to avoid having to do any straightening or excessive blow drying. \n Like I said in my title I'm feeling uninspired so I don't really have any examples of what I might like to do so I apologize for that, but any ideas or advice is greatly appreciated!

I got my oil changed recently and was notified that I should change my brakes soon. It wasn't in my funds to change them right then and there and I'm still sitting in water. I was wondering how easy it might be to change the brakes in my car by myself. \n Also, I let my phone charge in my car when I was out and it ran my battery out. Silly me. I got jumped but only enough to get it started and drive home and for 2 days after it still turned on but with some angry starter sounds. I've been driving my boyfriend's truck and he informed me that my car wouldn't start. I'm not going to be using my car for the next week anyway because I've going on vacation. What I'm wondering is, is my battery kaput and do I need to get a new battery all together? Or does it need a good solid charge? \n Last thing, how did everyone here learn about cars?

But what about the neckline? I'm also just as equally confused about color. I wanted a red dress, but upon looking at a lot of them, there really aren't any that are my style. I don't know what would look good with my skin. I'm half Japanese, half American. \n I'm not really a girly girl, so not the biggest fan of princessy things or poof or sparkles.

I feel the same way.  I wore a bunch of makeup in early high school but then stopped because it was too much work.  Now, at 29, if I put some on I feel weird, like a clown, like everyone notices and that it doesn't look right.  I wear strictly t-shirts and jeans (occasionally a tank top) and when I'm forced to get dressed up for events I feel really awkward and like it isn't me.  I've tried going shopping and have even bought some girlier/prettier clothes but I just can't seem to wear them out of the house because I feel like everyone notices and it feels like I'm trying too hard.  This is compounded by the fact that when I do actually dress up, people really do notice and have to point it out.  Its never in a negative way, of course; people are complimentary and comment on how nice I look.  But its the fact that anyone is looking enough to notice that makes me want to crawl into a pair of jeans and never leave.  I think I just really truly hate when people look at me, even in the most minimal of ways, and if it means wearing blah clothes and no makeup ever then that's what I'll do just to feel comfortable in my own skin.  I'm currently on a weight loss journey (down 25 lbs but looking to lose another 20 still) so I'm hoping that at the end of it I'll feel confident enough to wear better clothes.

"My girlfriend and I are going to the same college this fall. She is extremely smart, and I'd like to think that I am as well. It is important to mention that I have accepted a full-ride scholarship to college from the military. She will most likely be utilizing loans to stay at college. However, her home life is where things get hairy. \n She lives with her grandmother, father, and uncle. Her grandmother often flies into fits of rage, telling my girlfriend she is stupid, a whore, and will end up just as big a ""failure"" as her mother, who lost a scholarship to college because she got pregnant with my girlfriend. She has also told my girlfriend that once she leaves for college, she will not be helped financially, she isn't allowed to take her phone or her car, and is not allowed to come back during any breaks. \n To add fuel to the fire, my girlfriend has a sister from her father whom the grandmother and father will allegedly be going to court to fight for custody over. My girlfriend is now being told she will not be allowed to take any of her clothes or accessories, and her room will be given to her sister. \n I feel as though my life shouldn't be focused around all of these negative things of someone else, so maybe I deserve better and should worry about my own problems. i.e. leave her.

"Back story: I've been single about 5 years. Met a girl on NYE at a party, drunkenly danced all night, made out, slept on a futon together (nothing happened) got her number the next morning and proceeded to text on and off for a week or so. \n We decided to hang out, I wanted it to be platonic and more of a group thing but she didn't want that and it turned out being just us two.

So no lectures about being a dick are required. \n My question is, what's the most delicate way to let her know I'm not interested in her romantically.

"Hey MFA, \n I'm a senior in High School looking to attend prom. I'm about 5'9"" 145~ and was looking for some advice with my night's attire which is in approximately three weeks. \n 1) I'm aware of the debate between suit v. tux for the occasion and I know both sides have their pros and cons. At this point, I'm currently leaning towards a J Crew Factory  dark charcoal  so I could use it even after prom. I currently own a navy suit and feel as though these pieces would be a good basis for a future suit wardrobe. If anyone else has any suggestions for a slim fit <$200 suit, or even a <$150 tux, I'll strongly consider those options as well. \n 2) Concerning the fit of the suit: I stopped into the J Crew Factory store and decided to try on a couple of the suits to get a feel for the fit. They didn't have the original dark charcoal suit I coveted, so here are a few fit pics of the [suit jacket]( in a different color. The first three photos are of a 36s, the latter three of a 38s. I'm aware that the pants are very ill fitting, but I later found ones with a proper waist and inseam. I intend to get the jacket tailored, so please point me in the direction of correct sizing and what areas need to be tailored. \n 3) Assuming I get the aforementioned dark charcoal suit, I bought [these]( captoe oxfords. At ~$130, I'm not too keen on keeping them - they'll get little use after the event and was strongly considering returning them in exchange for something on the cheaper side. If I were to keep them, I'd be hoping they'd last for a substantial enough time to make the purchase worthwhile. Would you guys recommend a different color or styling for the shoe? \n 4) Matching/Complimenting my date: My date will be a coral dress, similar in [color]( to this one and was wondering if a dark charcoal suit would still be able to compliment her? I was thinking of a pocket square such as [this]( one, and I'm currently at a loss for the tie. \n Any and all advice is appreciated."

"I was reading these comments and I wanted to give my two cents.  I'm a Psychiatric Technician in the US Navy and this is not uncommon.  All too often we are forced to step up and help the ones next to us, even when we are suffering in silence.  Sometimes, as people have mentioned, there are long term reasons for the source of their depression.  Some people react better to therapy, while some just want drugs (SSRI's, MAOIs, anti psychotics, etc).  There is nothing wrong with talking to someone.  I work in an outpatient setting now, but I have worked inpatient before.  I see on a regular basis, in an outpatient setting, how many people ranging from E2-O6's that come in and just need to talk to someone or see a psychiatrist and are on meds.  The only way they are going to remove someone from AD is if you just can't function in your job.  We call it SPOIL.  If your depression or ""problems"" are affecting your spoils to the point that you can't function in your job long term, then it is normally a reason to remove someone from AD (medical separation, admin separation, etc).  SPOIL stands for Somatic (sleep, appetite, pain), Physical, Occupational, Interpersonal, Leisure.  Typically if you let this build up to the point that you don't feel safe, have intent or plan, and have thoughts of SI/HI on a regular basis, this is a reason for inpatient admission.  Mind you this can't speak for 100% of admissions, but a good bulk of them.  If you can cope and at the same time function in your work place, you will still be able to benefit the military and they will have no reason to separate you.  There are some jobs that have access to firearms and dangerous situations, that lets face it, someone with Suicidal or homicidal ideations should not be working.  This is for the safety of both the member and fellow members.  It's a rule that nine times out of ten they have to impose because it's easier to make a decision for a large group of people than to decide on a case by case basis.  If you are interested in reading up on some therapies that might work for you, look up CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy, specifically Mind over Mood which is a book) and DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy, which works well for Personality Disorders).

I've gotten female perspective on this topic, and now I'd like male perspective. I am considering whether I should attempt to get back together with my ex-boyfriend. \n This week, I (mid-20s F) met up with my ex-boyfriend (mid-20s M) to hang out platonically after not seeing each other for 6 weeks following our break-up. We caught up and had a good conversation. Things were a bit awkward in the beginning, but then we both relaxed, and were friendly and open with one another. \n The Breakup: We dated for three months. Yes, I realize that\u2019s a short time\u2014we are both the type to fall hard and fast for a compatible partner. From the beginning, it was somewhat challenging to see one another. We have opposite work schedules: I work a 9-5 office job, while he\u2019s a waiter who works the money shifts (Thursday \u2013 Saturday nights) at a high-end restaurant. However, things got more complicated when he moved farther away to help out a family member in need and started commuting 1.5 hours each way, AND began transitioning into a promotion at work, taking on more hours and responsibilities. I went from seeing him 2-3 times a week to 1 time a week, if I was lucky. The combination of our conflicting work schedules, his family situation, and not being able to spend much time together made continuing the relationship difficult and stressful. He did not have room on his plate for a serious girlfriend. So, we mutually decided to break-up, and it was a very emotional parting of ways. During our break-up\u2014a heartbreaking, messy, week-long event\u2014we both acknowledged that we were ending things based on our disparate life circumstances, despite still having strong feelings for one another. \n The Aftermath: We decided to give each other time and space, and stopped communicating for several weeks after ending our relationship. We are now both in a place where we feel comfortable spending time together again. During our lunch conversation, he told me that his family member is doing much better, and as a result, his home life is much less stressful. Likewise, things have settled down at work; he\u2019s now fully transitioned into his new role and has a set schedule (still opposite to my working hours, but at least less chaotic). He seems, overall, to have a better idea of what he wants and how to get it; a clearer trajectory. He seems to have a calmer, improved mental/ emotional state. I was very happy to see him in better spirits, flourishing in his new situation. \n Talking with him the way we used to, and hearing about all the positive developments in his life, made me think that maybe we could have a better chance at a romantic relationship together? Maybe after learning from our first time around, we would have fewer obstacles in our way? I\u2019ve obviously been doing a lot of thinking post-break-up, and one of the conclusions I\u2019ve reached is that he and I got much too serious much too quickly, which only added to the drama of everything else going on. Do you think it\u2019s a good idea or a bad idea to try to pursue a romance with him again? How might I approach it? I really liked spending time with him, and now I can't stop thinking about him. I'm scared that if I'm too blunt, he'll back off because of all the hurt we've experienced. The more I think about our interaction, the more I want to be with him again, or at the very least, continue a platonic relationship.	My ex (mid-20s M) and I (mid-20s F) broke up after a short relationship due to circumstantial difficulties (jobs, distance, family obligations, etc.), not because we lost feelings for one another.

So this story goes a long way back but I'll try and paraphrase. Three years ago I had a really good solid group of mixed gender friends. As teenagers do, we did our fair share of hooking up and crushing within the group. Around the time I started falling for one of the guys (who wasn't interested) I had a side fling with one of the other guys and we ended up having sex a few times (it was his first time). Because of that he has always wanted to remain close to me in the years since. Fast forwar to two months ago, I ran into him at the local bar and we spent all night talking. This happened three weekends in a row. It only took that long for a crush to fully form. Hardcore crushing. Fast forward again to last week, he asks to come over and spend the night. The inevitable happens and we sleep together for the first time in three years. Everything was fine but I got drunk and word vomitted, texting him telling him how I felt. All he said was 'I don't know what to say to that'. I feel like a fool. I'm positive he's not interested in me long-term. I think he just wants to be friends and I think I screwed it up. I feel like I'm smothering him as well, everytime I message him or ask to see him. As a backstory.. Which may or may not be relevant. I am a sociopath so feeling something other than blind rage is a RIDICULOUSLY huge thing for me. I don't really know how to handle it. Advice?

I don't know what your age is but just know this, in time a man's value increases (until about 50-60) while a woman's decreases. Most of women heavily rely on their beauty and sexuality to get what they want, some use a fake kind of innocence they learned it works on getting stuff from dad. My point is, at around 30, 30 something when they show first signs of ageing their ridiculous prince charming standards drop. Don't get caught up in a marriage you don't want just because it's the first woman who ever sucked your dick. And most important never think they are special, first step in being fried-zoned or used.

Had to make a throwaway for this. Bear with me as I try to be as detailed as possible. \n A little background: Me and (let's call him Draco) started working at this company on the same day about a year ago. I had never met him before and we were brought on board to work as a team. It was not the best match. Draco doesn\u2019t care about his job. He comes in late everyday, leaves early, and has a bad temper. (I am not alone in this observation) The toughest part is that we have to be amicable. There are times when we need to go on trips together and present work as a team. He does his best to steam roll whatever I say no matter how wrong he is. He\u2019s very confrontational and I have no defense. \n Recent Incident: \nMy main problem is standing up for myself in moments where I just freeze and just let him walk all over me. The most recent example started with an email exchange between us and our manager. I send out PDF presentation to Draco and Manager, 1 hour before meeting. I ask if I missed anything to make sure no errors happen. Draco responds that I missed a slide. I fix PDF and send out to Draco and manager again. Draco responds (again) saying that I missed more slides even though I didn\u2019t. He wanted me to add slides that were killed earlier by our manager. \n Then, manager directly emails Draco asking that we sit down and get the PDF in order to stop extra emails. Draco storms into my office demanding that I design something that was shot down earlier by our manager. He was seething with anger and I felt like he was going to hit me. It was really intense. So I quickly make the slides fully knowing that they're wrong. I send it back out to everyone. He leaves and loudly starts talking crap to another co-worker. The manager responds again asking me to remove the slides that Draco forced me to make. This is one of many incidents where I walk away feeling bullied and persecuted. It ruined my day. I couldn\u2019t think straight for a few hours after that. \n I don't know what to do. He comes at me randomly in a fit of anger and then is painfully nice to me when we're in front of people.

"I'll just get this out of the way first: I'm completely inexperienced when it comes to women. Never had a girlfriend (wanted some kind of relationship for years, but nothing), never been kissed, no sort of close relationship with a girl, ever. \n This is all coming just a few months after a particularly traumatic experience I had with a girl who I thought was a perfect match for me (she didn't exactly think the same way). Long story short I got a bit too invested in her and she made it clear she wanted nothing to do with me. The whole thing left me pretty messed up and it took a while before I could get to a point where I could honestly say I didn't feel like a worthless piece of shit because of it. \n Jump to Spanish class. I'm a year behind my grade level in the class, so I'm in a class full of sophomores (I'm a junior) and two other juniors. One of these fellow juniors is a girl (she's nearly 17) who's been in our grade for a few years now, but until now I've never really thought of in this kind of context. Our friend groups don't overlap whatsoever, so if it weren't for this class there's a good chance I would never have spoken to her at all. After talking to her more in the past few weeks (we've never really had any in-depth conversations besides Spanish homework/class etc.) I found I'm actually really comfortable around her compared to most other girls, and that we share a few tastes (in tv and football). \n Here's where my good old high school awkwardness comes into play. She's got her own group of friends, I've got mine, and besides having talked with some of her people these two groups have never really overlapped. It's one of those ""she's out of my league"" types of things. She's had plenty of experience with dating and boyfriends and everything else a  normal  high schooler does, quite unlike yours truly. \n Not to mention the fact that she's got plenty of guy friends lined up who she's much closer to than I am (she's  beautiful  and that's not just my stupid hormonal moody dysfunctional teenage brain talking), and the fact that I just found out that despite her lack of a 'boyfriend' figure she's been making a habit of 'hooking up' with another guy. Exactly how invested in this relationship she is/how long it's been going on, I'm not exactly sure; this is one of the disadvantages of being out of the 'loop'. \n The last thing I want is to regret never doing anything about this, but at the same time I don't want to risk things being that one delusional guy who thought I had a chance with her (not to mention having to sit through 5 months of Spanish class with her in the event things don't go as planned). I honestly haven't a clue what to do about this, but I certainly am not ready to go through another month(s) of hating myself for being so delusional as to think I ever had a chance."

I've got a faded black cotton scarf by All Saints.  It's enzyme laundered and asymmetric and it's basically like a huge soft goth bath towel.  It's not experimental as a piece per se, but it can be worn as a scarf, opened up and worn as a sarong, triangled and worn as a shemagh, twisted and worn as a belt type thing, or anything you can think of really. My favourite use is when travelling - you can roll it up in a spiral and use it as a pillow or open it right up and sleep under it.  It's my favourite piece by a mile.  It's even been pushed into use as a fresh water filter when camping, and any piece which can be used to filter out impurities and still look good SURELY deserves the title 'experimental'.	guy likes scarf.	139	3	other
Title says it all.  He's in a masters program to further his career while I'm a senior and we are working in a group project together.  The first thing that stood out about him is that he is very energized for someone his age and I correctly assumed he had no kids.  When we chat about topics outside of the project he has a lot of sage advice about anything you may ask him.  He is very perceptive and can read people quite well and is a genuinely friendly person and is always honest (which he admits will get him into trouble with some people).  He is well traveled and has had his fair share of adventures and really seems to know how to enjoy life.  He is an excellent cook and says most women he starts dating gain 10 pounds as a result. \n He believes his disadvantage in dating is that he's short and balding (he has a great sense of humor about it).  Besides that he's in great shape and a very smart guy.  He goes to speed dating events but for him that doesn't work well. 4 minutes is never enough to really get to know someone well enough and he cares more about having someone he can be himself around.  But what do I know about finding him a date?  I'm only 21 years old and I've never really been in a relationship myself.  I asked him if he goes to interest sites to meet people where the personality means much more, but he doesn't seem to.  He only mentioned considering such sites (and named reddit :D) but he is quite busy with work and school that I doubt he would want the distraction (you ALL know what I mean). \n How do I help him out?

"If you are teaching the whole  ""all drugs are bad, people who do them are bad, drugs will destroy your life""  approach, then you tell kids that cigarettes and alcohol are drugs, and they see people they know (often parents) using them, it starts by causing friction between the parents and the children but ends up destroying the whole foundation of anti-drug education \n You're building up a black and white image of drug use for the children which conflicts with their real world experiences. Drugs have potential to be abused and cause health problems; So do cars, guns, and even food. Some people rely on prescription drugs like xanax and adderall just to be able to live a normal life, while other people use them for recreational purposes. \n Basically, teaching that ""all drugs are bad, people who do them are bad, drugs will destroy your life"" while they live in a world where many of the adults they trust and who take care of them may drink or smoke on a regular or even occasional basis causes cognitive dissonance at an already vulnerable stage of development."

"So just to clear things up, I'm 15. I have a sister who is 18, we'll call her K, My mom (Who we'll refer to as Z) is currently with her boyfriend ""S"", but that relationship is going downhill. Anyways, here goes..\n My mother has been with her boyfriend for 10 years. Over these 10 years, he's physically abused her 4 times (to the best of my knowledge, and I only found out a few months ago about 2 acts, I saw the other 2), had a mistress for 9 years in Cuba, and walked out on us many, many times. Fast forward to 3 days ago; Z and S were in a fight, so S was staying at his mother's. Our house is currently under heavy renovations, so to try to make amends, S has been helping out with the house. (No plans for Christmas have been made at this point.)  After a long day of work, we go to bed. \n The next morning, S isnt home. His car is gone, he's not answering the phone when I call him, so I try to think nothing of it, and just get ready to go to my aunt's house for christmas eve. I went, had an amazing time, and got home and slept. \n For Christmas day, I went to my uncle's house. I stayed until 7, and went home. My mom at this point looked a bit mad, but when I asked her, all I got was an ""no oceanoleme, im fine."" At around 8:30, she says ""Hey oceanoleme, call S for me, ask him to come home to watch a movie/ have dinner"" So I did. He got home before I did, and took my mother's iPad, and went back to his mothers. When she found out, via my sister that she took it, my mom flipped. She drove to S's mother's house, found him in his car, they had a huge argument outside his car (With me in the passenger seat of her car). Turns out she had his Itunes acc. On the iPad, so she got all of his incoming/outgoing text messages. We went home without him, my mother broke down, explicitly said I'll manipulate whoever I need to to get this house done even you (In reference to me and my sister.)

You're getting some awful advice here dude. Trust me when i say, you don't need to spend that kind of money. The women who cut your hair have no idea what they're doing.

"When I was in high school I dated a college girl.  I thought this made me a major badass, until she invited me over to her place for the day.  She commuted to college so she still lived with her mom and her mom's boyfriend.  She called me one night and told me to come over tomorrow, that we'd have the house to ourselves all day.  So I got super excited for some sexytime and rushed over to her place the next morning at about 90 miles an hour. \n When I get there she's laying in her bed surrounded by pretty much every stuffed animal known to man.  She has special names for all of them and goes on and on about them in a baby-girl voice.  Is this foreplay?  My boner is confused.  When I get into bed with her I casually move some of the animals off...she flips.  ""What are you doing, they got here first!  And I told them that they can watch us...""  At this point I'm kind of laughing because I think she's just joking around, however freaky it may be. \n Then she decides a different course of action: We now have to hide from her stuffed animals because they've known her forever and would never look at her the same way if they saw me and her going at it.  We must hide under her extensive covers to fuck - in the 90 degree heat - while all the beanie babies and Winnie the Pooh's and multicolored unicorns press down on us from above, heaving on top of our writhing cocooned bodies like some unthinkable ritual.  Still feeling their beady eyes on me above the sheets, I think ""what the hell, it's sex"" and pull out a condom. ""Get that thing away from me,"" she says. \n So I'm pretty sure she was both trying to kill me and impregnate herself with my seed in the same day.

Generally speaking electronic access gates/doors/etc fall into one of two categories: fail-safe or fail-secure. Fail safe means that when they lose power, they are designed to behave in a way that maximises user safety (usually this means opening/unlocking the door so people can escape from any danger). Fail-secure means they are designed to maintain their security without power (usually this means staying closed so nobody can get in/out).\nThe second paragraph of the [fail-safe wiki]( tries to explain this, although it's poorly worded. \n Looks like OP's coworker lives in a very security-conscious gated community. As the top comment points out, I would have thought most places like this (at least in the developed western world) would be fail-safe but this is obviously an exception.	fail-safe doors open when they lose power (ensuring safety), fail-secure doors stay shut (ensuring security).	124	15	other
"Okay, Ive seen a lot of things about Michael Phelps and weed and I just need to get something off my chest. \nI am in no way a doctor, nor do I have any qualifications on the subjects at hand. However: \nI am an accomplished runner (5k pr is 16:54 and 1600 is a 4:45, if anyone cares) and know a lot about the importance of lung capacity when competing at a high level (obviously i never did anything near the olympics, but still) and being in shape. I also am an avid ent, something that I've mostly picked up after I stopped running in highschool. \nI've found, in my experience, that smoke entering your lungs does have a negative effect. I've heard some findings contradict this, but as someone who pushed his body to the limits on a regular basis, I believed I felt my lungs weakening after a large sesh. \n Michael Phelps has become, for many pro-weed persons, a sort of posterchild for this sort of ""haha he smokes weed and went to the Olympics haha were awesome"" philosophy. I honestly think that in training for Beijing, there was no way he was also smoking weed simultaneously. Phelps was the best in the world at eight different events that year. He was in such unfathomable physical condition. Smoking weed very much would have, in my opinion, effected his performance. \nNow I don't really know if Phelps just became an ultra pothead after Beijing (obviously there was the whole picture thing that surfaced a few weeks later), but it is obvious that so far in this Olympics Phelps is not in the same peak of physical condition. While this is probably because of less intense training, I think the point still stands: Phelps is not a good poster hold for Ents, because the odds are weed more than likely hurt his chances at the Olympics.

"Okay so I'm a 20 year old male and I have  a few questions I hope you all here can help me with. \n There was this girl I met a few months ago, a little younger than me (2 years) that I seemed to develop a crush on.

I didn't think twice about the date that was cancelled. \n About two weeks ago, we ran into each other. She asked me out and we hit it off great. Seddit helped out with whatever it is to make the good impression. Next thing I know, she's calling me her boyfriend and I'm not mad at that. \n Well, this entire ordeal lasted five whole days.

My bad in all this was my friends and family wanting to meet her. \n I've never really thought that introducing my current date to my family as being a further down the road move. It's just how I thought. I will take this hit from her as a mental note for sure, though, to prevent this in the future. \n Anyway, I like this girl and would like to nab a ""second chance"" to show that I can learn. \n SN: She's a virgin and we agreed to wait until the relationship had substance before we had sex, rather than bone and then go our separate ways.

So I'm a long time lurker but just created an account because of the experience I've had with this company. I ordered one of their topcoats online for my birthday, and was pretty stoked to receive it as I'm sure we all are when purchasing products online. Of course I wasn't expecting it to be there within days, but after a month and no confirmation email or tracking number I was starting to get a bit worried. So I sent them an email and they told me that they had re-sent the package and it would be there shortly. \n I waited another month and nothing was done. So I sent a second angrier email at which point they dispatched the package. By this point it was ready to pick up in store. So I went into the city, tried it and of course it was the wrong size and the wrong style. \n So I sent it back for a refund. Now given the way things had gone up to this point I wasn't expecting much. But again after a lengthy wait I contacted them again. They said they would see to it, nothing happened. So i sent a second email. Again nothing. I ordered this product in May last year, and to this day I still haven't received an email.

Hi! \nI really need some advice. I've been dating a girl for 2 months. First date went really well, and she suggested a second meet a couple of days later. I couldnt make it due to a prior engagement, but we agreed to meet at a bar later. Then we made out, and everything was fine and dandy. She then started university and obviously became busier, but we still went to a concert the week after. It was a great time, lots of kissing, lovey dovey stuff. After every date she texted me, and said how great it was, how sweet I was etc. \n I setup a date, two weeks ago, where she had to postpone due to lots of reading and having to spend time with her study group. I texted no biggie, bla bla. Then she starts not responding. No answer all weekend. I ask sunday, if studying is still killing her etc. I dont push for another meetup. We exchange some texts, and then no answer all week. I shoot off a casual text saturday, and I get an instant response. Then no answer until sunday evening, where she practically bombards me with texts. Her sister was moving abroad for a year and she was worried, etc. I console her and get no response to my last text (around midnight). Yesterday I got incredibly wasted and lost my phone. I am considering writing her a Facebook message, saying some asshole nicked my phone and ask how its going. Not sure whether it is a good idea or not.

"Ugh. \n Girls certainly get caught on the wrong end of a lot of double standards, but as a guy, this one drives me absolutely up the wall. The standing mantra here is ""Be clear from jump street"" which, fine I get it, but you know what else I hear from girls all the time? \n ""Don't judge us on things that are shallow."" \n Um. Okay? So which is it? \n I'm a generally cool-headed logic driven person that favors carefully thought out analyses to knee-jerk reactions, so these two goals tend to  conflict. A lot. To put it in perspective, let's examine another stereotype: the number of dates before it's socially acceptable to have sex with a new suitor. \n Now the number varies from person to person, but to prove my point, it isn't all that important. For sake of discussion, let's assume it's 3-5 dates. Now unless a date goes somewhere in the neighborhood of spectacular, I'm not going to spend more than 5-6 hours on a single date. Even if it does go well, I'm an adult, I have responsibilities to tend to in the morning, and I'm pretty much wrapped up for the day by midnight. So if the date starts at 6PM and ends at midnight, and we go on five dates that's a grand total of 30 hours spent with them between being strangers and being intimate enough to see each other naked. A little north of one day. And that's being generous enough to assume we didn't see a movie or go to a concert where conversation gets ruled out. \n See what I'm getting at here? I have friends that have been my close confidants for twenty years that I'm still discovering new sides to and new information about! It's a process that  takes time . If I don't make my intentions clear from the moment I lay eyes on you, it's probably because at that point in time I DONT HAVE ANY INTENTIONS TO SPEAK OF. \n So after 30 hours, you know what I've definitively learned about you? Generally speaking: How nice your smile is, how big your breasts are, and maybe a couple things beyond that. If I wait six months to make a move, it's because I spent those six months sizing up whether or not you'd be someone I had any interest in in the first place. So you can either accept that I'm acting on shallow judgments and information right away, or that non-shallow judgments take time to develop."

Just a little background: \nBasically my entire life, I've been a great kid. Good grades, good at sports, whatever. That all changed about 3 years ago (freshman year of HS). My parents got divorced and shit hit the fan, I spiraled out of control, made lots of mistakes, and did lots of drugs. \n Now I'm much better, and now I know a lot more about myself than I did before. For all 4 years of high school, I was a remarkable swimmer. I was offered scholarships to many schools, but ultimately turned them all down. I've been trying to shift my focus to my music (I play a bunch of instruments and sing in a reggae band) and I've started becoming a little rebellious, like I have in the past. In other words, I've been smoking weed and trying to write good songs, and just live the way i want to, and I'm happy doing it (apart from being afraid of what my parents and girlfriend might think). \n My parents, on the other hand, want me to go to college, get a business degree, and come out just like everyone else...which is exactly what I DON'T want to do. But when I think of this, I get into an argument with myself over being poor my entire life, or being rich without doing the things I love. \n I know life is too short to waste time on anything other than what makes you happy. Right now, I just can't seem to pinpoint exactly what that is. I don't know where I want to go to college, hell, at this point I don't even know if I'm ready to pack up and leave. I don't want to leave my friends (all juniors) and girlfriend (sophomore) behind. I feel immature, rebellious, and lost. I can't even find the self-discipline to do my homework in high school. I'm afraid that if I go to college, I'll become a failure...because right now, I'm too busy contemplating the meaning of my existence to learn a whole lot. \n I'm not asking for anyone to write me out an entire life game plan. I'm just asking...does anyone have any similar experience, or any strategies to help dig me out of this thought-hole? I feel like there's no unbiased person that can give me advice in my life, so I'll leave it to you, reddit.

Pedestrian vs. car accidents are usually the fault of the car. Not always, but most of the time. The reason being that most of these kinds of accidents happen in areas where you can reasonably expect to find pedestrians (like parking lots and crosswalks). When you drive a car in these areas, you have a special duty of care to look out and make sure you're not driving too fast or proceeding without being absolutely sure there's no one walking in front of you. The person generally has the last chance to avoid it unless the car is doing something crazy, like not looking where they're going before making a turn (your situation), or going 30 through a parking lot. But for this reason, sometimes the pedestrian will be at fault to some degree, limiting the amount they can recover by whatever percentage of liability they held.

The last real wardrobe overhauls I'd done until very recently had been for work wear in my old career. I wore random and old stuff or some of my funkier work stuff on weekends and it didn't matter. Then a black hole of baby growing. Finally this new year I decided to start taking care of myself better and be really thoughtful and intentional about my clothing purchases (which I really needed since it was embarrassing how little presentable, fitting clothing I owned). I have been shocked at how boot cut jeans are now passe, skinny jeans are appropriate for all ages and sizes and not just for malnourished hipsters, and a lot of 90s fashions I thought were dead forever are back in full force. I have been really pleased by the nice new fabrics that are easy to find now like ponte (a thick stretchy black knit great for comfy pants), athletic/technical fabrics that are stretchy and soft and comfortable, and jersey and other thin knits that hang and drape really well. \n I spend time browsing this subreddit and surfing fashion blogs and online stores. When I see a style or fabric or accessories I like, I pin it on pinterest, and then often do a search on pinterest for keywords related to it. Like I recently did ""culottes"" and ""wrap cardigan"". It both helps me learn what that word/phrase means, and finds lots of examples, some of which I might really like and then I pin them too. \n I am no expert and in an early stage of my wardrobe transformation but I am really defining my style and what I like, getting adventurous about trying new things, and really happy with the whole endeavor :)"	pinterest :D	312	2	other
"Story time \n So I got pulled over once for ""speeding"" but the cop said he didn't get it on radar so instead he gave me a ticket for not signaling on a lane change.  I didn't have the time or motivation to fight it so I paid it($168) and went to traffic school. \n So I'm at traffic school and the guy goes around asking what everyone was here for just for fun. It's mostly small stuff speeding, parking tickets, running red lights...  So they get to this one guy and they ask what he did to get traffic school. He tells us he was drunk and ran off the road, knocked over a light pole, a mail box, hit a parked car and drove thru some shrubs and finally puts a hole in a brick wall(over $20,000 in damages according to the guy). He says he then fled the scene and then came back later once the alcohol had burned off. \n At this point we are all floored. So the teacher says ""wow, you must have had some hefty fines, I'm surprised they let you take traffic school."" The guy say ""No, I just had to pay a ticket and do this."" Someone in the room asks, ""How much was your ticket?"" He says, "" $168 bucks""."	Drunk driving and over $20,000 in property damage is apparently equivalent to not using you blinker when changing lanes.	217	19	other
Applebees also used to not have dishwashers during their slow shifts.  They would have their servers wash the dishes instead.  Not only is this a major health code violation, but the servers were also only getting paid $2.65/hr in my state to do a job that legally requires minimum wage.  Luckily there was a lawsuit and most of the servers during those times received back pay for the time they had to do this.	Applebees definitely treats their employees like shit.	74	7	other

"I see a lot of people in this thread posting about how easy it is to wake up to an alarm if you're motivated enough and not lazy. While this may be true for some people (even OP's brother), it's not true for everyone. \n I've had trouble waking up my whole life. When I was about 2 years old I slept through a fire that started because a power transformer exploded right next to our house. Some people just sleep very deeply. I work a full time job doing something I absolutely love. I look forward to doing the work I do everyday, but if an actual person isn't around to wake me up there's no telling what time I'll wake up. It doesn't matter what time I go to bed or how many hours I sleep. \n Alarm clocks only work so for long. It's like I just get used to the sound. I've rigged alarm clocks to stereo systems, I've used alarms with the attachment that shakes the bed (which worked for about a month, then I just started having dreams about trains), and I can't tell you how many alarm clocks I've had that claimed to be ""The Loudest Alarm Clock In The World!!!"" I've woken up to find 70 to 90 missed calls on my cell phone more times than I can count. \n It really is an issue. It causes a lot of stress for me and my family. My mom and dad can't seem to understand that I can't help it. I don't do it on purpose. I just can't wake up. It's like this probably 85% of the time. No one else I know is like this, so no one seems to really understand that it's not a matter of laziness or motivation. I just sleep really hard. \n So please, everyone, realize that it might be a different issue than you think. It really sucks when people think you're a lazy piece of shit because of something like this when that's not the problem. \n Sorry for typing out this novel, but this is a problem that causes me a great deal of stress. Mainly because everyone thinks I'm this way for the wrong reasons."	Just because someone can't wake up doesn't necessarily mean they're lazy or unmotivated. Maybe they can't help it because they're just better than you at sleeping. \n Edit: A word.	369	29	other
I'm not sure about the giving back part being enforceable, but breeders put that in so their dogs/cats don't end up in a shelters and then given to owners who have no fucking clue what they're doing. This is more important for dogs than cats, but breeders care about the animals they raised/bred and only want their best interests. \n Also about the spaying/neutering: I'm farly sure that part is enforceable or at least pretty sure the breeder WILL find out. Breeders will have you sign a different contract if you want to breed their line, and many do not want their pet quality animals bred. If you're buying a show quality animal that's a different story.	don't be a backyard breeder, don't allow your animal to have an accidental litter.

"Backstory, I'm a 20 year old high school drop out. I dropped out at 16 for no reason whatsoever. My parents never made me do my homework; my parents always told me that I'm smart, so I figured ""why do it?"". Looking back, I wish I would have done things so much differently, but if I could reverse time, I don't know if it would be even possible for me to do anything different. I would play video games all day long and say to myself, ""tomorrow will be different. Tomorrow I'll catch up"".

I start every semester with a smile on my face thinking that things will be different, but day after day I get further and further behind and the mountain piles up once again. I have 6 days to finish basically 1.5 classes' worth of work. The real kicker is that none of it is hard work, it's fucking high school. All I would have to do is google most of the shit, but since it's so time consuming all I do is get bored and do something else. I can't focus for more than 10-20 minutes at a time. I also have to call my teachers once a week for participation. This is 10% of the grade, and I can't even pick up the phone when they call. They call non-stop and I never pick up.

Then i think he's taking the show to far. There is no context given as to why the people are in the position they are in. I'm happy for the people and their promotions but plenty of people in that company do get promoted for a number of reasons besides who they know. Often it's because of not only hard work, but the skills they have acquired throughout their years of work. \n I remember one guy on undercover boss who cleaned out portapody's with the CEO, and then got promoted to make motivational speeches. He basically got promoted because he's an inspiring character, but aside from that what skills did he have to offer? We don't know because we have no context but in all likelihood he was just a really nice guy. Which is awesome for him and those around him but not for something higher up. \n I think the show's heartwarming feelings of the little guy finally getting his due is nice, but you cannot take it that literally. It's a show designed to make you feel that way. I haven't watched the show recently so this might have happened, but could you imagine if the CEO just beast-modded all the jobs and did them no problem?

"They come from two specific roots: 'th-' words come from Proto-Germanic [* sa ]( oblique '* \xfea- ', a determiner meaning ""that""; and 'wh-' words coming from [* hwaz ]( a general interrogative pronoun. \n Specifically to OP's question, there were two types of adverbial extensions to these roots, * hwa-n , ""at what time"", * hwa-r , ""at what place"", and * \xfea-n , ""at that time"", * \xfea-r , ""at that place"". \n In West Germanic languages, * hwan  and * \xfean  were further extended to * hwannai  and * \xfeannai , with what I assume is a locative suffix, but with the same general meaning. These last two are the direct ancestors of English 'when' and 'then/than'. \n ""What"" and ""that"" both come from the neuter nominative forms of these two roots. \n There was also a second determiner, [* hiz ]( meaning ""this"".

Was raised on pretty hardcore catholic or christian values, whichever one, and by the time I learned to masterbate I learned something about me. No ejaculation. Ever. Wait a week to a month between sessions (as a teen you bet your ass that was hard), not even a drop. As many jerk off sessions as I wanted, no clean up required. Thought it was cool and all. \n Then come girls, and we all know they like to talk (not said in a demeaning way, more an attribute) so I didn't exactly want that to spread around school and stuff. So off I jerked off through my teenage years with no fear of getting busted with dirty tissues or socks, and to be honest I had to look up the sock references cuz never I never needed it, let alone a box. \n Never went to the doctor about it specifically because until about 18ish always had a parent in their with me, awkward stuff telling religious parents your masterbating and sterile at 13.

This was exactly what happened to me. \n My ex and I were together for close to 2 years. Last December she went back to Sydney to visit her family and met this guy, Hobbs, whom her cousin introduced. When she returned, she would constantly text Hobbs but she'd show me the texts exchanged just to prove to me that nothing was going on and would then get angry at me for 'not trusting' her. This came from the very same girl that disallowed me from talking to any of my female friends during our relationship because she'd get jealous and this is the same girl that deleted girls that I had things with, off my Facebook. \n Anyway, she had to move back to Sydney for university in July and had a mutual break up the night before she left. Months prior, I was planning on moving to Sydney to study and be with her, but she thought otherwise. She didn't want to do long distance because she 'didn't want to go through the pain of missing me', and I thought it was a fair decision. 3 weeks after she left, she got together with Hobbs.

Hey.

How funny how people see things... years ago I found myself homeless after leaving the military (literally living on the streets). On Christmas night I found a $20 bill wrapped in a receipt on the road. I had a cheap jumbo jack earlier but was starving as I barely had enough money to eat any meal everyday. As I didn't own a car and had to walk everywhere I went to the only restaurant that was close by...but it was about to close. This was on Christmas for fuck's sake! And do you know what this restaurant crew did? They served me a steak dinner (that I hadn't been able to afford in a while) and treated me with respect no matter that they could tell I was homeless. Actually they (including the cooks and busboy!) sat at the table and we bullshitted about a bunch of shit. That day changed my life.

"The real problem with ADHD, ADD, and dyslexia are not that they are real problems that many people suffer from, but that a majority of people decide for themselves that they have it and/or are misdiagnosed with it and then they use it as an excuse. I've spent several years tutoring college level students for all levels of math and many of these students I will end up working with for a long time through multiple terms. What I come across more often than I would like are people who clearly have no disorder but use their disorder for excuses as to why they don't do their homework or go to class or study, etc. ""I don't go to class because I have ADHD/ADD and I can't focus on the teacher"". ""I don't take notes because I have dyslexia"". ""I didn't do my homework because I just couldn't focus on it"". These are people whom I've worked with one on one for hours and hours and I've seen them write down a problem, listen to me explain things, do problems on their own, etc. What I see the majority of the time (I'm talking 95% of the students) is that these students are fully capable of doing whatever they put their mind to, but the moment something gets too tough for them, like they don't understand a problem within the first 15 seconds of reading it, is a complete failure to even try and an excuse being made due to their disorder. \n I'm sorry to ramble on about this, but I've worked with hundreds of students over the years and a lot of them are medicated for disorders like these and a lot of them are not medicated but diagnosed and it is extremely rare for me to come across a student who appears to actually have a problem. Instead what I see constantly are completely normal people who don't want to put in the effort to learn and fall back on their disorder as an excuse not to try harder. \n For example, there was one girl whom I'd worked with for 2 terms. I had seen her weekly and helped her with homework and general questions. I'd heard her read out loud from the textbook, her notes, my notes, etc. One day she tells me she has dyslexia and that's why she has a hard time with the story problems. I didn't say anything to her, but I was thinking: no, you don't have fucking dyslexia, you just have the same problem that almost every single fucking person has, which is a difficulty in interpreting words into math. It's hard for everyone, even me! And the thing that really annoyed me was that I had heard this excuse so many times before when in reality there is absolutely nothing wrong with the person except for the fact that they don't study everyday (more like once a week for most students, or just when they see me)."	ADD, ADHD, and dyslexia are real and are problems for some people. Most people who say they have it do not have it, but use it as an excuse for why they are unable to learn and understand as quickly as they would like (read instantly).

"Last night around midnight, I learned my grandma of 91 years died. I never really knew her. She visited my family several times here in the US, but she lived in Mexico, so she didn't visit often.

So a couple weeks ago there was a deal on moderntailor.com for a $19.99 blue oxford shirt, and since I had been looking for one for ages, I decided to jump on it despite the fact that I hadn't ever ordered a shirt online before, especially not M2M... \n So I picked a shirt that fit me well, took some measurements from it, took it in a little where I didn't like the fit on my other shirt and filled out all the measurements more or less blindly. \n well it came in the mail today and I threw it on for you guys to see.  Here you go! \n I honestly couldn't imagine it fitting much better than it does now considering my way of Frankensteining a bunch of measurements together. If I want to order another, I need to add about a half inch or so to the waist of the shirt, seems I didn't calculate for it to sit on top of pants casually enough and it flares out pretty hardcore when untucked. \n Despite that one little inconvenience, I got a $30 shirt perfectly made to measure (if tucked in, which it will be most likely...) that seems to be put together extremely well. it took about 2 weeks to get to me, which doesn't seem too bad or anything. \n if you have a favorite shirt and want something affordable and that will fit just like that same shirt, DO IT. \n So MFA, what do you think?	check out my new moderntailor shirt, let me know if you like it or see any fit issues, worth giving the site a shot if you were on the edge about online M2M shirts.	247	34	other
This kind of argument really bothers me, as it totally misses the real reasons behind large family sizes in poor nations and makes the implicit assumption that people in these areas are too stupid to know how to prevent pregnancy themselves. What many often overlook is the fact that having large families in many developing areas is all but a necessity. Firstly, in a poorly industrialized economy a plethora of children is often needed to provide the labor, and thus income, to keep a family afloat. While this might seem counter-intuitive, one must remember that the price of raising a child in these areas is often incredibly low, allowing older children to eventually bring more money to the family than they consume. Furthermore, as wages in these regions are usually very low, even the small amount a grown child can earn is often a necessary supplement for survival. \n In addition to adding income, a large family is often needed in such countries as a means to support the elderly. In most industrialized nations the elderly are provided some form of institutional support, be it welfare or housing, once they become too old to work. While one in this western scenario might hope their children find enough success to provide for a more comfortable retirement, there is no need to worry about homelessness, starvation, or abject poverty. This is not the case in many developing countries, where such government programs are often insufficient, poorly implemented, or entirely absent. As such, parents in these nations are left with the choice of either having a small number of children, hoping one of them will be accumulate the wealth to support them later on, or a large number, under the assumption that these children will collectively be able to provide enough funds to care for them in old age. When your ability to survive in later life is very much in question, pursuing the second of these two options seems like the obvious choice. \n If you really want to help developing nations, don't blame the people living in them, look to current global economic and political conditions. The preferance for cheap manufactured and raw goods, made for western consumption, has created conditions that leave individuals in poor countries with a need for large families. If such areas provided gainful employment or adequate governmental structures, we would likely see family size drop substantially. As such, if you really want foreign aid to help, it must not only focus on food or contraception, but also on education, development, economic growth, and humans rights.	Don't be prejudiced against the global poor in their choice to have large families, their economic situation often makes this decision unavoidable.	427	22	other
I had a bee get stuck on this part of the window the other day too. He was struggling for so long but I didn't want to go near him because he looked super SUPER pissed. Every time he freed the leg that was stuck he'd end up getting another one stuck. Eventually I managed to give his stuck leg a nudge with a ruler and he flew off. Anyone know why bee's struggle with this part of the window so much? It looked like the tip of his leg was jammed under it.	Saved' a bee. Why do they get stuck in windows like this?	94	12	other
This is the only area where China would still benefit. They have the largest supply of rare earth minerals which are required for making advanced technological devices like the iPhone. \n In the event of a fall in the Chinese economy that would be the only thing that keeps them afloat. \n But let's be honest, the US owes China a lot of money. China would not jeopardize the money that is owed to them and their economy in a war with the US. This is not the '50s and they are not being run by a highly idealized communist regime. Nor do they have a military power allied with them that can match the US and EU/NATO like they did back in the '50s when the USSR was a major power. \n China has North Korea and Pakistan, maybe. If Pakistan enters the war though that will be localized with Pakistan and India fighting each other for the most part. China also has a global economy dependent on many nations that would ally with the US or would be blocked from trading with by the US Navy. In short, getting into a fight with the US would only be long term detrimental to China and they are smart enough to know the consequences. \n If North Korea decided to outright attack the US, which is the ONLY way we'd get into a war with them and we all know it so stop acting like we're just going to smack them around for no reason. China would either remain neutral or at most allow refugees to seek safety fromt he war. They would NOT go to North Korea's aid. For one it would work in their favor to have North Korea gone. A united Korea would end up having stronger ties to other Asian countries than to the US. South Korea has such a strong tie BECAUSE OF North Korea being a constant threat. \n Remove that threat and the united Korea would be able to no longer rely on the US as a major defense and trade partner. They would be able to trade much more openly with China, who would take an interest in helping to rebuild the infrastructure of the north and get it up to speed with South Korea, and would probably focus more on trade with other Asian nations since the constant US supply would be less frequent with a smaller US military force present. Fewer US personel equates to less of a US based market.	China won't go to war with the US if North Korea attacks. Don't be stupid.	416	15	other
My car was totaled recently, and so I called AAA and had them tow the car from the site. The driver told me to just talk on Monday and took it to the AAA certified garage. Now being charged excessive storage fee that I did not agree to/was not told about. \n Is there a max storage fee that they can charge per day? Do I have any other options besides paying?

So this is probably a dumb question/very high school sounding, but I feel really clueless about how to go about these things. I am 22/f, he is 21. We went to elementary school together and lost touch over the years. We have started talking over facebook/text messages over the past few months and I have noticed that we have a lot in common, and when we hung out in person for the first time I had total butterflies. \n Here's the complicated part: I just got out of a relationship a couple weeks ago, and I think I might be friend-zoned with this new guy because we started becoming friends while I was still in a relationship. I mean, he seems really flirtatious when we talk, but maybe that's just his personality? I don't know, I'm just so bad at reading guys. \n So reddit, do I tell this guy that I like him? I would really like to be friends even if he doesn't feel the same way about me, but am I totally nuts for wanting to see if maybe he does? \n Also, I am sure many of you are thinking that I should probably wait until I'm not so newly-out-of-a-relationship, but I'm also concerned about the risk of being further friend-zoned (if I'm not already :/ ). So is it ever okay to pursue someone new relatively soon after a breakup? \n All advice is very greatly appreciated! Thank you!

"The story is that I met this amazing guy at the bar, he is the cousin of one of my friends. He is kind, funny, and honestly the funnest guy I have ever known (this is not limited to just guys I've dated). I have such a good time on our dates, and when we watch a show (firefly) I swear I have never been so comfy in someone's arm. I even have been considering a long distance relationship for once the summer ends because I go to school a few hundred miles away. But the problem is that when we kiss ( we've actually been taking it surprisingly slow) I feel absolutely nothing. No spark. No ""dear god please take my clothes off right now"". Absolutely nothing. And so I know that even though he is awesome and fun and the best guy I have ever been with, this relationship can't go anywhere because I'm just not attracted to him sexually. It sucks and I'm mad about it, I've been trying so hard to make it work but I just know it can't. The advice I need is how to do it. How do I break up with the most awesome man I've been with, I don't want to be mean, and if possible I honestly do want to be friends still so we can keep going to things like roller derby and attacking our bucket lists. Has anyone ever been in a similar situation?"	Amazing guy I honestly think I could fall in love with and see a future with, but tht I'm just not sexually attracted to.

You seriously just need to grow a pair and just talk to your boss in no uncertain terms, escalate it to people in the company above him, or quit. Be sure to document all your communication in regards to solving this issue. \n Childish passive/agressive crap just makes you seem like huge douchenozzle yourself (assuming this story is even remotely true, which I have my doubts about). \n Don't put peoples lives outside work at risk. For all you know he's an awesome husband or father but just a dick at work because he has shit bosses of his own and has been working there for 15 years or something. Or maybe he is really is just an asshole to everyone. Who knows? \n Blackmailing the dude via his wife because you can't take care of your own problems? She has to fix your problem for you by having her marriage potentially ruined? Maybe the guy honestly deserves it, but that sure as hell isn't for you to decide. Work is work, home is home, and thinking you have any right to involve yourself in someone else's private family life is bullshit and petty, and makes you sound like a far more horrible person than he is. \n Asshole bosses suck, but be an adult and take care of your shit better than a fucking melodramatic High School teen would. \n OP's	"I'd rather ruin a marriage and break up a family than act like an adult or find a new job."""	227	20	other
This happened many years ago, back in CA, but I've always kinda wondered why it played out like it did. \n I had just gotten surgery and was pretty loopy on meds when I got a phone call saying I needed to pay a vet bill for one of my rabbits. I thought I had already paid it but figured I was out of it an misremembering, so I cut them a check. \n Turns out someone had gotten into my vet's info including my bunny's name, the doctor who saw her, and how much I had just paid off. \n So I filed a report with my bank saying I had been scammed, but they told me that since it was a check there was nothing I could do and that I had signed. The representative told me that if I had used a credit or debit card they could have disputed it. I argued back that if I had given them my card number it would have been the same as giving them my check, it's not like they guessed the number or would have done anything different to trick me. \n She said since it was a check it didn't matter, and I accepted it because I was still dealing with healing up and figured that $100 to be gone.	I still don't quite understand the legal implications of this. Why is it so different? Why is a check given to a scammer valid no matter what?	219	27	other
I have a similar story. When I was a kid I was playing with my cousins in the front yard. My cousin happened to be wearing these bright yellow shorts (it was the 90s) and he claimed he felt this sharp pain on his ass. He wrote it off as nothing and we went back inside. He felt another one of those sharp pains. He didn't know what was going on and he felt yet another one. He decided to go into the bathroom to check on his butt and when he took is pants off a wasp flew out. \n I shudder to think how he was only a few inches away from being in the op's situation.	instructions unclear, wasp stuck in pants.	118	6	other
My ACTUAL best friend died of a diabetic coma a few months ago. It was sudden and unexpected. A lot of people knew how close he was to me and showed great support. Anyways, I attended the funeral, and while there saw a lot of people. Most of them people who trashed talked, bullied, or plain out ignored his existence there. They were all talking about how they were all very good friends of his, and some openly weeped loudly to gain attention. I was floored. I got heated very quickly, but luckily some mutual friends overheard and knew the situation and got me out of there. The nerve of some people. \n Edit: Forgot to mention the blow up of RIP facebook statuses. And groups that popped up.	Fuck fake people.	128	3	other
One year ago, I met a girl named Anna at the wedding of two of my really good friends, Mike and Lily. Lily was roommates with Anna and always wanted us to hit it off, but Anna lives a good 800 miles from where the three of us live. \n The wedding was amazing. Anna and I had an awesome evening dancing and celebrating. I loved getting to know her, but I wasn\u2019t sure how realistic it\u2019d be to pursue anything because she lived so far away. I was too chicken to ask for her number, and so we went our separate ways. Little did I know that Lily had given Anna my number, and a couple months later, I received a text from her. We talked every other day or so, and not long after long this, I flew out to the city where she lives in visit my brother, who lives there as well. I met up with her a few times during my visit, and when I left, I really felt like this could be worth pursuing. \n We continued talking the next few months after that when I began to realize that I was the one who was initiating all of our conversations. Calls (once a week) went unanswered, then she\u2019d text back asking if she could call me in the next couple days. I didn\u2019t think much of it, but this was literally happening every time I called. Then one time she never called back when she said she would. At this point I was like, alright, I can take a hint. I hate feeling like I\u2019m annoying someone, so I stopped calling and texting to see if she\u2019d initiate any. Nothing for 2 months. Then a text came, and the whole thing repeated itself. Talked every other day, then she\u2019d be a little slower to respond, then not answer at all. \n I just don\u2019t know what this means. Can there really be people who exist that have feelings for someone, but never initiate conversation? \n I heard from Lily that she got me a Christmas present (most likely an inside joke gift) that she\u2019s waiting to give me when I go out there to visit my new niece in a few months, and that she always tells Lily how awesome I am. But I just can\u2019t wrap my mind around not being the one to ever initiate a text or call to someone you like. \n Anyways, I set up a phone date with her tomorrow night, and I\u2019m really just considering opening up to how I feel about her, even though I think I\u2019ve been more than obvious about it.

So I'm in my final year of university. There's a rental crisis in my city and when I returned for my final year the rents had gone so high and there were so many people looking for accomodation that I wasn't able to afford to rent a room anywhere. \n My boyfriend moved 40 miles from the city to work and offered me to come live with him. ( Split the rent/bills etc. obviously)\nThat was great and I drove two hours a day to class and back and in the evenings I worked to pay my tuition, rent, bills, car, gas etc..\nA few months in I was finding it hard, money was tight, very tight and I was just about covering car expenses and rent. Everything I earned was going on car tax, insurance, petrol, rent, bills and college expenses. I didn't have enough money to eat or buy clothes or anything at all. I often went days without food. On top of this with the driving and the working I didn't have time to study. \n I got a new job that involved missing some classes but I had to eat. Public transport would have costed over 120 a week so I had to keep the car. \n So I worked more and missed more classes and then I began missing deadlines and then it was agreed that I would have to submit everything late in the autumn as my course is very intensive and half assing it just doesn't work. \n I got a parking ticket a few weeks ago outside the university. They dont have parking for students and where I parked they only allow you to stay 1 hour. My lecture ran long and I was 30 minutes late back to the car. \nA few days ago cop arrived at my door looking for 150.00 for the ticket or I would be taken to the station. \n It was my rent and petrol money but I gave it to him. I did not want to be taken to court. \n I had an exam today. My final exam. I missed my rent payment because of paying the cop and now the landlord has issued me a notice. I couldn't drive my car because I had no money for petrol and no money for a bus. I'm hungry. I'm upset. I've wasted so much time trying to do the right thing. I can't do it. I feel like such a disappointment and a failure. \n It's going to cost me thousands to repeat the year. I don't know what to do.	Poor, hungry, failed university	429	4	other

Did you just say that?) and then he asks if I want popcorn and I say yes... and he refused to pay because he ""wasn't going to eat any"" (alright.. why did you ask me..?) and finally he fell asleep 10 minutes into the movie and woke up to ask what had happened (Uh dude!

Something happened to me and 2 friends our freshman year. We lived in a learning community so all of the people on our floor went to class together and our group was given the floor to encourage studying together and everything. We had an english class where there was little to no syllabus besides the assignments as the teacher always told us she loved it when we worked together and that we could be in charge of most of the syllabus. fast forward to end of year she had us writing journals and they were due. my 2 friends and I get a call from her that she is going to fail us if we don't meet. we go an meet her. she says we plagiarized. we were confused. she held up our copies of the definitions from our textbook that were typed up and printed out. I explained to her that if they're from the text book they would all be the same....hence glossary. she didnt get it. we tried to explain how we all lived with each other (she never knew) and her syllabus had nothing on it about plagiarism and go figure the definitions weren't even part of the assignment. she made us do an extra assignment.	stupid english teacher	210	3	other
I'm sorry for the long background story. \n I come from an Asian country, my family is nowhere poor.  My family is also not close knitted, everytime I see my friends with their families, I get jealous because they are all bonded and cherish each other deeply. For me? A family full of hatred and that's how I grew up with such a mentality. I'm sure when a kid grows up, earns money and settles down, they are expected to be filial to their parents. Give them money every month, visit them, chat with them. However my brothers don't. I have three older brothers; all of them older by at least 11 years (I'm 15). My first brother is very rich I must say; have multiple sports cars and a very huge house (I've never been to his new house that was constructed 4 years ago) that even has an elevator in it. He has a PhD and earns a lot of money. His wife is a bitch and dislikes us, so he never hangs out with us or talk to us (we used to be close when I was younger, now he prefers my older cousin over me.) Recently, he & his wife, his kids and his wife's relatives went on a cruise. The only relative he brought from his side was our grandmother. My second brother is a teacher and got married this year. He has not moved out yet, despite being 28 years old. He shares my room and is a nuisance. He plays a lot of computer games and the noise is starting to bother me, especially when I'm having my major exams this year. It's also very uncomfortable to share a room as I'm a developing woman. Because of this, we got into an heated argument that ruined my first day of 2016. He also never pays anything in the house, eats our food and use our water and electricity as if he's entitled to it. Note, my family has been struggling with money for quite some time now, my first two brothers never offered to help nor gave my parents money every month. My second and third brother used to help out at my mum's office, but without them she's struggling and they don't care. I can't do much besides helping mum in housework and studying hard, but my second brother really is starting to get on my nerves. I don't know what I'll do one day, maybe shove his face into the keyboard in the fit of anger. (Well I most likely won't) so my question is, what can I do to make my family bonded? I dislike my first two brothers nor do I wish to talk to them, but if it can make my parents happy, I don't mind.	brothers are dicks, nobody tries to help parents, what should I do to make brothers help? \n EDIT: my brothers do not give my parents money every month, despite being university graduates, each over 27 years old with a stable life and job.	467	42	other
"Relax my friend. You still have plenty of options available to you. You have 2 days off a week, which is average.  But hey, at least you have 1 day of the weekend free (better than me).

I don't know a lot about this subreddit. I need help, and I figured this would be a good place to start. \n Hello, I am a guy (17M), and a girl (18F) that I love is terminally ill. She is going to die soon, we don't know how soon, but she will die if her doctors can't pull off some sort of miracle. \n Our relationship started about a year ago. She was the longtime crush of one of my best friends, lets call him John. One night when it was just the two of us, things got a little steamy. We ultimately decided that we couldn't be together or she would lose the friendship of Jim (who is one of her closest friends). \n After telling Jim about our night of passion, he freaked out, said he never wanted to speak to me again, and her relationship with Jim was never what it used to be. I never stopped liking this girl. I didn't stop thinking about her constantly until I forced myself to because I realized it wasn't healthy. \n Fast forward two months, Jim and I realize that we can't let a night of unsound judgement ruin a lifelong friendship, so we began being friends again. Fast Forward to a little over a month ago, and I find myself at a football game with Jim and the girl. At this point, Jim has a new girlfriend and has no feelings for the girl. She and I exchanged some awkward glances, but barely looked at or spoke to one another. \n A few weeks ago a friend of mine, who was entirely aware of my obsession with this girl, sent her a Snapchat of his face with some nonsense text, hoping to start a conversation. Sure enough, she sends me a text a few hours later to ask what that was all about. We decide to get some dinner the next day. At dinner, we catch up for several hours, and go our separate ways. \n Over the next few weeks or so, we see each other in group scenarios, and she even starts inviting me to her performances(shes an actor). One night, out of the blue, she invites me and Jim to dinner. We have a nice meal, and Jim has to leave early because his parents were really upset with him about something, doesn't matter. We go and sit in her can and talk for almost 3 hours, and then we just start making out again. She stops. She tells me that she has a heart condition that is fatal. Her doctors say that she could die any minute or she could live until she is 30. \n Before you ask, there is NO WAY she is lying. \n She says that she learned about it over the summer and tried separating herself from her friends, so that they would be less emotionally hurt by her death, but it was all too enticing. She started to hang out with her friends when school started. She said that she really liked me, but we couldn't be together because she didn't want to emotionally hurt me. \n Three days later, we hang out again, and get sucked into the passionate make out session that has followed our last 3 one-on-one encounters. She is upset at herself for letting her get sucked in like that, and said that we could not be alone again until two weeks from then (which is this Sunday). \n I can't convince her to be with me. We text every single day and spend multiple hours on the phone every week. I love her. I will be crushed by her death, and every day that I spend away from her feels like a century. \n What do I do?	True love is terminally ill. She wants us to keep at a distance so that we don't become emotionally attached before we dies. It is killing me.	625	27	other

Ok guys, I\xb4m a student, jobbing as a barkeeper and used to flirting so usually it\xb4s not hard for me to meet girls and hooking up with them. Thing is, i only seldomly really date girls on a regular basis because i usually lose interest pretty fast after dating one time or getting intimate with them. That\xb4s not because im being an asshole or something, I just am picky when it comes down to character when i want to get to know somebody.\nSo i worked during New Year\xb4s Eve and met this cute girl (she\xb4s a student,too) and she gave me her number. We dated one time and she texted me on a daily basis. And i really did want to meet her again, so we went on two dates after this one together. We kissed on the third date and she just didn\xb4t want to let go of my hands after kissing and asked when she could see me again and so on...\nThe same night after this date she texted me that she had a good friend that was approaching her after our date and confessed he wanted to start dating her cause he likes her. While she still really likes me she just got her feelings mixed up and she asked if we can still keep meeting (but on a more platonic basis) till she knows if she wants to commit further or go with that friend of hers. \n \n I don\xb4t want to meet her as a friend and told her likewise and that she should think about what she wants. While i think it\xb4s hard to talk about feelings after three dates i told her i liked her, too. We still text from time to time(more likes dates but just by text messages) and keeps telling me that she would really love to text me the next day and so on...\nLast time she specifically talked about that movie in the cinema no one wants to go watch with her... Before going to bed i told her i would gladly date her in the cinema but not before she got her feelings straight.\nSo i didn\xb4t text her for a week now but I\xb4m not sure if I should just write her or just wait it out till she\xb4s gonna come to a conclusion.\nJust want to point out that i wasn\xb4t in a relationship for five years now while still meeting up and getting intimate with girls pretty regulary but this girl is the first girl in ages, i really want to meet up more with.\nI usually really hate personalities that don\xb4t know what they want.\nWhat\xb4s your advice, guys?

He's smart but overly cocky which is only human.  Beck is just a cock-cuddler.	Beck is a cock-cuddler and Bill is (more or less) chill.  Shut up, don't even joke about this shit.  If Bill Maher is an asshole then Glenn Beck is the thundercuntiest of shitwhistley plebeian troglodyte philistines.  Seriously.  Fuck him to eternity (and you too if you support him and are smarter than the average rock).	104	55	other
Well it still works just fine as a boot.  I live in Calgary AB.  We get a TON of snow and I make due just fine in these.  If you are trudging through snow they suck, but if you're walking down a sidewalk which is reasonably clear you'll be fine.  Considering how few cities in the world get as much snow as we do, I think these boots are great.	It's not a work boot or a Sorel, don't expect it to be.  It is however a very functional every day boot that looks fantastic.	70	25	other
"When I was in my early to mid twenties I distinctly remember watching gorgeous women I knew from either high school or college post overjoyed Facebook statuses alongside an album of sonogram pictures.  Every single time I sighed and mentally crossed them off the list of women I would ever be able to date or sleep with...  5 or 6 years later and here I am, no kids and a respectable hairline, dating and sleeping with divorcees and single mothers that would've laughed in my face had I asked them out half a decade ago.  It would be extremely satisfying if it wasn't almost always an exploding zeppelin ride of emotional despair.  The part of me that wants to shout ""HaHa!  Apparently now I'm out of YOUR league!"" generally just shuts the fuck up after listening to a week or two of horror stories about how their baby daddy left them two weeks before they gave birth or slapped them at Thanksgiving dinner or whatever else."	Please, please make sure you're certain he's a decent guy before you have a kid with him or you'll be reduced to banging me.	166	24	other
And then after all that campaigning what? We get another corrupt president? Another corrupt congress man? If we are going to fix anything we need to reform the entire staff. We need to unify political parties so we don't just target the other side and never vote with them. The founding fathers never saw parties as an issue because they all stood in the middle. As should all voters and politicians. Our government has fallen apart to the pout where we can't get anything done besides secret spying stations. The government t is not on the side of the people anymore. It is on its own side. If they wanted to instead of trying to take money from the rich and give it to those who need for hospital bills (which wouldn't be such a bad idea if it were not helping the problem at all). Instead of that they could regulate health care prices. They can basically charge us anything they want because it is not an open market. If you are dying or bleeding to death or just have a bad (treatable) illness, they can fuck you over. How much would you pay for your life? You only have a few hours so you better think fast, tic toc tic toc. Oh by the way that medicine it took us 20 dollars to make, yeah we are making you pay 2000 because it saved your life and we can make you pay anything. \n Our government could restrict the above process but they get bribes from said companies. They are paid to let these people fuck us over. \n As I was saying. The government is not on our side. They are not for freedom anymore. They work for themselves individually.	the government will just replace the assholes we campaign out. We need to put in major reforms and remove political parties. \n Sorry for rant	291	24	other
"Hi there, \n I'm a clerk at a grocery, and we have a new person working in my dept. He seems alright, but has been talking about how he gets mentored over the weekend (his parents own a company known locally for selling mattresses, or this is what I've heard). \n As I would for any other coworker, I expressed general curiosity (""Oh, what are you getting mentored for?"" ""It's hard to explain. It's about assets.  People think that rich people don't work for their money, but they do. "" something something life decisions). \n He asked if I was interested in business opportunities, and I gave some sort of neutral-friendly comment like ""Well, I'm always interested in things that'll help me out while I'm a student. And social work isn't guaranteed money but I'm passionate about it,"" He mentioned if I was interested, he'd consider referring my information to his mentor.   He said he'd give me a heads up first, so I wouldn't get any surprising calls from a stranger. \n Well, he didn't give me a heads up and I missed a call the other day. After texting to ask who it was, I get a text back saying I was ""(Name) referred to by  __  and to give him a call when I had a few minutes"". \n I'm uncomfortable because, when I texted coworker to clarify (""I missed a call and was wondering if you could give me some context? What should I be talking/asking him about? What kind of referral?""), I didn't get a response. \n My gut is telling me to be wary, that this might be some sort of MLM/ponzi scheme? Mostly because when I asked him ""What do you mean by assets?"" he said ""Ah, it's too hard for me to explain but Billy would be able to do it better"" and a lot of vague comments about wealth and stuff. \n Am I being paranoid? I have a very honest face and I'm quite friendly at work (very perky ,chatty, motivated) and that's lead to a lot of people trying to involve me in their tupperware parties, nailberries, etc etc because I will ask questions and such. \n I just don't want to call some random guy on the phone and potentially be pressured into anything...?"	Coworker with vague mentorship passed off my number (after saying he would give a heads up), hasn't responded to texts asking to clarify what I'm supposed to talk to this guy about, feeling weird about the situation.	377	37	other
Comcast sales rep here, and i hate to do it because it'll suck for me, but call a first time, ask a series of questions, then say you'll call back (unless the rep really sounds competent) and call back the same number and ask about installation again. Pricing and packaging WILL differ, there are dozens of different packages and every rep sells different. \nSales reps will generally ask some questions. You can ask questions too. Don't ever feel bad about a long call, we love long sales calls. We don't have AHT (average handle time) like customer support does (retention, technical, billing). Ask your prices, your terms and how long your promotion is for and how much it goes up (usually 20-30 bucks). Most tv and int packages and in most states reps are required to transfer customers beginning a contract to TPV (third party verification). Ask what install options are available. Pickup, shipping, or pro install. If the rep insists the house needs a pro install, try not to push it or what happened to OP might happen to you. Always check to make sure you have enough outlets (or you know how to split the cable) before signing up for a self install kit. \nI agree that Comcast is probably the worst and i can't wait until google fiber comes to save us all, but some of the customers are the stuuuuupidest.	Always verify your info from Comcast and all isps. My job is to get you to pay as much as possible. Per month and one time.	234	26	other
Hello and thank you for trying to help me with my little pickle. I'm 20 and currently working for a landscaping company that is quickly moving into high end water feature/pool design and instillation. This is my second summer with them and the owner of the company has asked me if I am interested in going to school or going through apprenticeship programs for 3D modeling/low voltage lighting/irrigation and pumping solutions. It is a smaller company that has been successful for over 30 years, now with two sons that are in transitional phases in solidifying their own lines of specialization within the company. I would be expected to take ideas and model them for potential customers and work mainly with the one son that is specializing in pools/water features. I would be doing skilled/general manual labor and would allow them not to outsource the lighting/irrigation/plumbing work as outsourcing the works sucks on so many levels. \n Now for the real pickle. \n I enjoy the landscaping work and see a real enjoyable and successful future with my company. My problem is I can't get past my ideals that I would do something different, something more white collar/academic I guess. \n I have always been interested in electronics, specifically automated processes. I was planing to go  back  to college for electrical engineering and pursue a career in a field where I could be involved in the automatization of various systems. I also am interested in power generation and flight avionics, all of which I can pursue freely with a E.E. technologist degree. \n So do I commit to my company and potentially become skilled enough to contract myself not only to my current employer but to others as well, starting my own business? (Which would be really nice, but would require an amount of dedication I'm not currently capable of) \n Go back to school (which I enjoyed and excelled at, but a personal breakdown forced me to find a job (landscaping)) and get a degree with which I can diligently choose the path I want. \n Or just say F it, go to school for police foundations, join the Canadian forces as an MP and be awesome. The adult and responsibility express. \n I am very disappointed in myself for doing nothing for the past two years and need to make a decision, but man, oh man, ffff.	Critical role in successful landscaping company  or  power generation  or  flight systems  or  computer niche field that will explode in the next 50 years  or  cop  or  say fuck it and be a hobo in Toronto aspiring to bum it out in Miami.	391	43	other
